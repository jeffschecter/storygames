                    So, Ben Lehman spent much of the morning trying to convince me to work the Forge Booth at GenCon, but that's not what this post is about.<br/>
<br/>
His next goal was to convince me to start a new online arena (forum, etc.)  to discuss and promote inclusivity and greater diversity in both the roleplaying community and in the styles of play being practiced (since one would imagine that these are somewhat connected, though not in a 1-to-1 way).<br/>
<br/>
A transcript of this part of our conversation is posted here:<br/>
http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/04/ben-can-convince-you-to-do-anything.html<br/>
<br/>
To summerize:<br/>
- How do you create a space to talk about inclusivity and diversity in roleplaying?<br/>
- If you let everyone in, the people who are normally excluded from these conversations will continue to be excluded, because they will not feel welcome.<br/>
- If you limit the people you let in, to create a more diverse space, you run the risk of really being exclusive, and only allowing the voices that you're comfortable listening to.<br/>
<br/>
Do we really need an open forum or a think-tank?  Or something in between?<br/>
<br/>
This is sort of a question of unrestricted capitalism (something like RPGnet) vs. a dictatorship of the proletariate (something like 20x20).  Surely there are new fangled ideas and tools we can use to find some sort of middle ground, here, because neither of these really sound like they'd accomplish our goals.  Story Games itself is more like the modern US economy, mostly free market, but with regulations in place which hopefully ensure that people are more-or-less fair to each other.  This is AWESOME (I love you, Andy!), but not exactly what would be needed in this case.<br/>
<br/>
How do we get the roleplaying forum equivilent of say, Sweden?  Well, Sweden with more diversity.  Or, say, the Carribean, where people mostly chill the fuck out and talk about the One Love.  Obviously, large amouts of hash are not the only thing they have going.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in a somewhat related issue:  if you're interested in participating in such a forum, what would you want it too look like?                </div>

                            I think that, if you create a bulletin board to discuss these issues, there'll be self-selection: you're likely to get the people who usually feel excluded because they'll want to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
I do think if would be rather odd if there was a board to discuss inclusivity in roleplaying which only let certain people in.<br/>

                            My two cents are like Graham's -- I think that if you have a strong core group to participate (which I think you could recruit easily) and a very well-written mission and conduct statement, your group will be largely self-selecting.<br/>

                            You want to create a space... to <i>talk</i> about inclusivity and diversity?<br/><br/>I'm a little confused.<br/><br/>I can definitely understand wanting to create a place that actually is inclusive (which Story Games is) and diverse (which it's not), or a place that appeals to those that don't feel at home on existing fora (note - as you and Ben noted, these are probably two different places). But to create a place that lets us <i>talk</i> about inclusivity? Are we an activist group looking for a home, now? I was under the impression that we wanted to talk about roleplaying games.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that you were aiming toward the latter of the aforementioned two, but it looks like you drifted a little with regards to the goals of such a place.<br/><br/>Before we can talk about exactly how such a place should be configured, It's probably important to nail down exactly what we want it to be.<br/><br/><br/><i>"Also, in a somewhat related issue: if you're interested in participating in such a forum, what would you want it to look like?"</i><br/><br/>Hmm...

                            Graham and Ben and whoever else is in favor of an open community:<br/>
<br/>
Okay, great.  But I'm not prepared to run a forum as large as the Forge or Story Games.  There are necessary limitations in how big this sucker can be.  Does that change how I set it up?<br/>
<br/>
Nir, yes.  My personal goals would be to link together a lot of the "lost children" and talk about how to develop new practices, revamp existing practices, build community, address important issues, gather some of the diverse blogging about this, and, last of all, create a place where we can actually try some stuff out.  Online play is a MAJOR way in which those alienated from traditional roleplaying communities have found an outlet.  So a subforum for forum games or a place to link to transcipts of actual play would be awesome.<br/>
<br/>
So if we were to consider possible meta-categories for discussion, as if this were the Forge or Story Games, they might be:<br/>
<br/>
- "New Play Styles for New Audiences"<br/>
- "Ethnicity, Culture, and Gender in Roleplaying"<br/>
- "Community Building and Support"<br/>
- "Collaboration and Productivity"<br/>
- "Links to Things Worth Looking At"<br/>
- "Play Games Right Here"<br/>
<br/>
How's that sound?  This is a collaborative medium and I'd like for putting together such a forum to be a collaborative process, even if I have to do all the grunt work myself.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>I'm not quite ready to get into all my many and varied and deeply conflicted issues about this quite yet. Soon, hopefully, but not this moment. <br/><br/>The one thing that I will say, without hesitation and as a very clear thing in my mind, is that said site would have to walk a very fine balance about not demonizing, force-grouping, or alienating other sites, discourse communities, and modes of play. <br/><br/>I know this sounds like a funny thing to say, given that it's a sight about inclusivity -- but the problem is that historically such communities have run into problems of self justification in an us vs. them mode that causes nearly as many (sometimes more) problems than it fixes. <br/><br/>It probably doesn't help that I spend a lot of time in all the diverse RPG communities I'm part of in a state of low grade frustation that occasionally spikes into mid grade rage because of the already bitterly fractured and alientated modes of discourse. As someone who works on, plays, and loves both indy and mainstream games I take shit from both sides that is ignorant, arrogant, self-righteous and boils down to "why do you talk to those stupid fucks when you have us?" <br/><br/>Anything that makes that kind of split deeper for the purposes of ego-gratification, making a sense of self worth at the cost of the worth of others, giving a shield to economic or theoretical motives behind levels of rhetorical ageis about vindication, or any of the like may well drive me to madness. <br/><br/>(Note that if something needs to be blown to fuck to create lasting and positive change, I can be down with that. But so far my experience in the communities isn't that people want to work and sweat for positive change* they want to set up places where all their friends can tell them that they were right all along (not so bad, maybe anoying, but not so bad) and that the OTHER IS WRONG (this is where Brand has to roll to resist his rage). <br/><br/>I'm also more than normally concerned with these issues in this particular case because I get a slight sense of a conflation of two distinct goals going on in your post: <br/><br/>1) Giving a place for those whose styles of game or discourse do not let them feel comfortable in some/many/most/all of the current fourm communities out here on the ragged fringe. <br/><br/>2) Giving a place for those who want to make all of gaming more inclusive<br/><br/>These things, while they are linked in causality, are not the same issue, and if we go into this with the idea that they are we're destined for problems. <br/><br/>I know this sounds like a very negative post. It isn't. I do see a lot of value in both A and B -- I just think we need to clearly understand which we are doing, and why, and have some clear goals about how we can go about both without turning it into a political bitchfest that doesn't change anything other than to split the community. <br/><br/>So, Jonathan, thoughts? <br/><br/><br/>*There have been folks who do this -- I'd argue strongly that Ron and Clinton did this with the Forge. Unfortunatly the Forge has now fallen into the same problem that Unions fell into mid-century.... I'd also say folks like Levi and Tony have done some amazing work of this type in bridging gaps between RPG.net and the Forge, but that's working within communities rather than creating new ones.                        </div>

                            Good points, Brand.  But why do you always preface your responses to me by sounding like you're swallowing glass or something?  I promise you I'm not gonna create a new forum that's simply an ego fest and ruin the internet forever for you.  What's eating you, dude?<br/>
<br/>
I don't hang out on RPGnet and don't visit the Forge much anymore, but it would be good if we could make this any new space supplemental to the ones that are already here, instead of just creating new spaces that do more or less the same thing.  I don't want to take people away from Story Games or the Forge but to enable conversations and projects that wouldn't happen as easily in other places.  I still plan on reading Story Games as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Brand, I guess my issue is that I'm not REALLY a member of Subgroup #1, there.  I feel alright posting on the Forge or Story Games or RPGnet or whatever.  People may not pay me any mind, but feel reasonably comfortable there.  However, I find I get a whole lot out of hanging out with people in Subgroup #1.  So the selfish part of me is interested in a place where I can hang out with Subgroup #1 and work on Project #2.  Working on Project #2 is something I want to do anyway and the people in Subgroup #1 (along with a crew of interested others) are the people I want to do Project #2 with.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Also one way to keep from alienating or competing with other sites would be to prominently display links to other discourse communties, blogs, and other types of things (RPGtalk, etc.) and to try to encourage people to integrate discussions on the new site with other discussions elsewhere.  I would definitely like to avoid declaring other stuff to be "bad wrong fun" as the cool kids say.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>I'm not really clear on which subgroup is which and how they relate to which project. So, let me just ask a few questions. We'l use me as the example, because I deserve to be picked on. <br/><br/>I'm a long time RPG.netter (like 8 years or something) -- but I don't post there as much as I used to. I'm also a blogsphere d00d -- but I don't post there as much as I used to. That's because these days most of my attention is focused on StoryGames and then the Forge. I'm a loud member of both communities, if not exactly one of the most respected members of either community. I feel pretty comfortable in both communities, and when I don't have no problems brawling with those who feel differently until we get a resolution Gangs of New York style. <br/><br/>I also am one of those uppity femenist inclusionist social constructivist marxist bastards who wants more voices and wants to explore elements of gaming that I don't think are getting fair shakes in some of my current community subgroups. I want to see some serious work on immersion and social aspect system development (the system of freeform, for example). <br/><br/>I also want to have some serious talks about exclusion and gender and things like that -- but I don't neccisarily want to do those two things in the same place because I see a real danger of them being conflated, especially when mixed with a community designed to cater to those uncomfortable with the other communities I am a part of. I have real worries about the union of "a place where the excluded hang out" with "talking about how exclusion works in the community" because its almost inevitable at that point that there will be a lot of "how those bastards are wrong for excluding us" talk. <br/><br/>So, let us say you set up your new community. Let us say I jump on to be part of it. Where do you see me fitting in? I'm a Forgie. I like push styles of play. I am a name associated with other communities. I will not agree with any kind of "us vs. them" mentality. I will have lots and lots of very pointed questions about immersionism and similar issues -- but because I want to understand them and advance them and don't feel that I have the knowledge to do so yet and not because I want to disprove them. <br/><br/>What are you going to want me to bring to the discussion? How are you going to respond when I get short with you because I feel in the middle between two groups that are eyeing each other agressivly? Would you want me there at all? What about when I want to talk about my Forge style game with the folks on the forum to get input from non-Forgies?                        </div>

But setting the topic of conversation as "Let's talk about diversity" as opposed to "Let's talk about role-playing, which just happens to be happening with a more diverse group and different ways of talking to each other" is just going to create a "diversity ghetto," so to speak.  It's going to send the message that these people, who want to have a discourse about role-playing with different topics and community norms and standards, are outsiders as opposed to peers working together.  I don't know if that makes sense, but it would be a concern to me.  I would want to be very careful about sending the message that what outsiders get to talk about is their status as outsiders and why that is, not actually talk about role-playing itself (or only get to talk about it through the lens of diversity).<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's really important to have a diverse group of people to talk about these issues, because otherwise it's us sitting on our mountain preaching about how Things Should Be without being in touch with the people who are actually playing differently from us (or not playing at all!).<br/><br/>So I think that if you're going to try to do both, it'll be really important to concieve of it as, "We need a diverse group to address these issues," not "The appropriate space for 'outsiders' is one where these issues are discussed."  Does that make sense?  It's a question of which goal comes first . . . .<br/><br/>Jonathan, it sounds like the project you're really in love with is the think-tanky, let's-figure-out-what-we-can-do, diversity-discussion oriented one.  Maybe one of the projects that's going to come out of those discussions is a forum where some of the people who feel marginalized can be welcome.  <br/><br/>I'd actually suggest that if you don't consider yourself one of these marginalized people, don't set up a forum for them - help them find a critical mass and tools and a moderator to do it themselves.  That way they're not the lost children who need help from Daddy to make a place for them, but a community of their own which can reach out to other, similar communities like this one.  Talking about - and, implicitly, treating - these people as "lost children" is making me very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>On the exclusion/inclusion issue, I'm going to repeat what I've said several times already and say, "Let us be more."  Let everyone in - but don't rely on who randomly finds the site.  Go out and recruit people from very different communities, and make them feel welcome.  Tell them, "Hi, I want you here, because you do Harry Potter role-playing on Livejournal," and you'll be shocked how much of a difference it can make to their willingness to participate.  Have tiered membership if you need to, with core members who are chosen through concrete service (leading projects, moderating, recruiting new members from unusual communities) and who represent the diversity that you're hoping to get on the site.  Or require every new member to bring in a member from a different role-playing community before you give them full membership.  Those are just some ideas, but having an invite-only, limited membership is a really good way to say, "Hey, we're the insiders, and we're going to decide how to address the diversity of you peons out there."  This is not going to do good things for your project, I think.<br/><br/>I'll add that I have no idea if I'm invited, or welcome, or if I'm what you have in mind - but I'm really interested in getting down and dirty, and figuring out some concrete design challenges or web efforts or recruiting material or what have you in order to actually make a change.  I don't just want to discuss this stuff, I want to act on it.<br/><br/>Finally, I just want to say that I am someone who really does not feel welcome on the Forge, but does feel very welcome here - and a lot of that has to do with a couple of individuals who posted encouraging, welcoming things to me during my first couple of days and made me feel that I had worthwhile things to contribute.  Don't underestimate what social ties can do.  At the very least, it worked for me.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

I don't just want to discuss this stuff, I want to act on it.</code><br/><br/>Jess, wanna be a co-admin? (my response to that comment was "Yes! Yes! Yes!")<br/><br/>Yeah, I was definitely thinking that this would need active instead of passive recruitment, seeking out folks involved in other types of roleplaying or semi-related activities (online freeform, MMORGs, fanfic-y stuff, text-based stuff like Skotos, Scandinavian larpers, Anglo-American larpers, Japanese roleplayers, as well as mainstream tabletop and indie people, some hardcore Amber kids, some cosplayers, people working in game/narrative studies, people from online writing communities, etc. etc. etc.).<br/><br/>You're totally right that the think-tank idea is what really gets ME excited, while the super-giant forum thing was more what made Ben do the happy dance.<br/><br/>But yeah, figuring out how to set it up and how to set the tone is sorta tricky.  We'd need a title like "the Pan-Roleplaying Accessibility Conference" (but less wordy and lame) to get across the sense that it's would be a group of people representing all the various streams of roleplaying, working together on stuff.  But yeah, recruiting people outside of roleplaying would be important too, but harder.  We could probably rope in a few people like my brother, who never really got involved in roleplaying, but are aware of it and interested enough to talk about it.<br/><br/>It's kinda worrisome that both Brand and Jess said "I don't know if I'm invited."  If you want to be a part of it, I think you should be involved.                        </div>

                            Um...not that I feel welcome here or on the Forge, but may I make a few suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
1) Don't let the tradition of forum design breed the same problems they have.  I believe Shirky has some of the greatest advice: http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_user.html  There are several practical, tested ways to moderate content drift and flames which don't require much admin attention.<br/>
<br/>
2) Have both a open-wide forum and invitation-only circle.  Best of both worlds.<br/>
<br/>
3) If you want to promote diversity, take a few notes from non-profits.  In this case, invite a small number of highly visible, well-connect, diverse bloggers to have blog homes on this site (above the forum).  This will clearly show that diversity is not just welcome, but 'enforced.'  It will emphasize topics stemming from a more diverse viewpoint than 'what everyone else is talking about.'<br/>
<br/>
4) Do not allow pure democracy rule.  Some mechanism is necessary to protect 'minority voice.'  (Pure democracy becomes the tyranny of the majority, not what is being asked for here.)  Create a strong mission statement and select and replace board members and leaders based on how well they 'produce' on the mission statement.<br/>
<br/>
5) Start with a _temporary_ leadership group to openly discuss the initial set up and take suggestions (to be explored and never outright dismissed; this can allow non-diverse people to architect a diverse platform) and USE DEADLINES!  Once the comment period is over, it's over.  (Don't succumb to the tyranny of the unbounded middle; 'as soon as we are ready.')<br/>
<br/>
6) Get heavy-duty back-end support; don't let interface difficulty keep out the less-computer-inclined.  (Another kind of diversity.)<br/>
<br/>
7) Check out the stuff which Clinton Nixon and others discussed on the 'RPG Planet' stuff.  Try http://www.google.com/search?q=anvilwerks+%22RPG+planet%22 (Click on Cached, I don't know where the archives went.)<br/>
<br/>
Just a few observations, memories, and suggestions.  Hope this helps.  Thanks for your time.<br/>

                            Fang, you're reading my mind on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>.  My email to Jess included this paragraph:<ul><br/>One thing we could do, I was just thinking, is recruit a core group of admins who themselves hail from diverse communities, since they would know where to find people to invite into this thing.  How we would find these people is another question entirely.</ul>
Yes, I like the idea of a temporary core that gets everything set up and then lets things start rolling.  That's basically what I did when starting <i>Push</i>, the roleplaying journal that should debut before GenCon.  I invited a bunch of cool people and we sorta hashed out how we wanted things to work.  Let me think a bit more about your other suggestions.                        </div>

                            This was so strongly related that I'm cross-posting it from the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=590" rel="nofollow">recent thread on immersion</a> (emphasis added):
<ul>I think talking about "immersionist" players is as bogus as talking about "narrativist" players or "power gamer" players. Individual players are vast and contain multitudes. Variety is the spice of life.  If you're talking about "immersionist" players, that means there are also "non-immersionist" players. People can't just do one thing or the other. People can learn to play and enjoy playing all sorts of different ways.<br/><br/>Personally, I wanna learn more about immersion so I can LEARN HOW TO DO IT BETTER and add those skills to my repertoire. And I'd hope that people who are already old immersion hands would be similarly interested in discovering the fun and fascinating possibilities of interrupted, negotiated, heavy meta-game play or other types of play that they might not have messed with before. That doesn't mean it has to become their New Favorite Way To Play, but everyone sticking to their guns and being "I only want to play My Way, ever!" is what created these barriers in the first place, yo.<br/><br/>As this guy named Ron Edwards once said, when he proposed this classification system called GNS, "Label play styles; don't label people."</ul>
Which suggests to me a possible project name:
<ul>The Legion Boards: We Contain Multitudes</ul>
In case anyone doesn't know the original reference, it actually comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(demon)" rel="nofollow">a demon that Jesus exorcised</a> (there are different versions of the story in three of the Gospels), but the phrase is hopefully common enough and the story obscure enough that the origin of the phrase won't drive people away.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, I'd avoid the Legion reference.  I do think it will be alienating to people who are strongly involved with a Christian religious community.  Even if it doesn't bother them, it'll mean that they can't discuss it with their family and friends - and isn't that what we want to happen?  I'm sure we can come up with something else that contains multitudes.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Fang, great ideas!

                            Is "storyplay" a broad enough term to cover all the various incarnations of roleplaying and roleplaying-like things?  Damn, I hate inventing more jargon.  Oh, well, Googling for "storyplay," it looks like someone else already invented it.                        </div>

What I'd like to see included in a place like that would be a social forum for stuff like the kickass Gaming Recipe thread here on Story Games.  Just a place to talk about real life, triumphs, sorrows, current events and so on.  A sort of smoking lounge or coffee shop type atmosphere.  Something relaxed.<br/>

<br/>
The point is to create a place that is more welcoming and inclusive.  Someone who feels alienated from gamer-speak on the internet might very well post something in a more personal forum.  For instance, snack recipes they usually make for their friends while they play or perhaps share a lament about how stresses at work are affecting their free time.  What a forum like that does is lower the barrier to entry.  If they start participating on a more personal forum, they are likely (IMO) to eventually branch out into the more theory-heavy, play-heavy, social issue-heavy forums.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            I think Troy's right about a welcoming, inclusive forum lowering the barrier to entry. I also think Jonathon's right that that would be a very different sort of forum.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathon's also right that you shouldn't argue about names. ("Plays Well With Others" irritates me, for example, because it's a distinctively American phrase. Should that stop you from using it? No.)<br/>
<br/>
There were a couple of questions above which I don't think were quite answered, by the way...<br/>
<br/>
1. If someone thinks being inclusive is a bad idea, are they welcome on the forum?<br/>
<br/>
2. Can anyone who wants to join the forum join?<br/>

                            To not be all happiness and joy, there's some dubious folks who commented on my blog.  I'm reposting their thoughts here.  I'm not sure I have complete answers for them yet, but am certainly worried about their concerns as well.<br/><br/>Claire Bissell wrote:<blockquote>Hmmmm. It sounds interesting but fraught. How do you stop the enterprise coming across as totally patronising?</blockquote>
Malcolm Sheppard wrote:<blockquote>Uh, forgive me for being bold, but a couple of white guys talking about how especially exclusive they're going to make a forum is probably, if anything, the exact opposite of moving gaming away from a stereotypical locus of power. Because it actually is about power, you know.</blockquote>
To answer Graham's questions, I think the forum would be open to people who were pro-inclusivity/diversity but thought we were going about it in a fucked-up, stupid way.  Like Mr. Sheppard would be welcome if he wanted to constructively criticize the way the site was being run.<br/><br/>People who thought the splintered roleplaying community was just fine the way it was and didn't need to be more open an aware of other types of play or players... well, I would wonder why they even bothered to show up.  If they just started knocking down other people's suggestions over and over, they might be asked to leave and then, by the consensus of the co-admins, booted.<br/><br/>As for your second question, I think people seem to be saying that it needs to be an open forum, which I think is fine, as long as we actively recruit from roleplaying communities outside of tabletop roleplaying.  I wouldn't want all the discussions to be about our side of things.                        </div>

So much really powerful talk is going on and this thread alone is gold, but I have to want to know who is, at least for the moment, responsible for this vision?<br/>

Whoever that is, there should be only one thing we can demand of them; they must identify their willing successor.  Everything else they do is wonderful and up to them.<br/>

                            Just a couple ideas in brief:<br/>
<br/>
Make sure the website meets some standard of disability access (i.e. ADA compliant)--you don't want to exclude people with disabilities just because they can't access your site.  Ideally, have some of those invited folks be people with disability issues and encourage them to give the site a good shake down.<br/>
<br/>
It might make sense to have a forum (or whatever functions for one) dedicated to discussing community outreach possibilities beyond the net--ideally, a place where those new rpg'ers talk about ways that they would have found the rp community more inviting and where we can all go to find insights about making our own play more inviting.  I think inclusivity will only catch on to the extent that it reaches beyond the internet.                        </div>
