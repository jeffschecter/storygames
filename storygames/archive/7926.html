Tentacle City was the winner!<br/><br/>EfTC is a survival horror game with heavy satirical elements. You make groups of survivors equal to the number of players, each with a "marginalized and disenfranchized" gimmick or theme. Then each player gets one group to "GM" through the tentacle threat, while all other players make a member for that group. The groups take turns doing scenes as the cast is picked off one by one, until each player has one survivor left from whatever group. Then those characters come together as the final group to hijack The Man's evac helicopter and escape Tentacle City once and for all!<br/><br/>(Willow, do you have the game hosted anywhere? I'd like to provide a link.)<br/><br/>I played with Zach, who I know and have played a con game with before, and Nick and Jason, who I met that night and pitched the game to. We made the Homeless Veterans, GMed by Nick, the Irish Dockworkers, GMed by me, the Out of Work Clowns, GMed by Zach, and in a twist on the "disenfranchised" concept, the Laid-off AIG Employees, GMed by Jason. We drew up our map of interconnected locations and were off to the races.<br/><br/>The game had an awkward start for the first few minutes, as I had a hard time scene-setting from a "cold start" as it were ("Uh, you're at the docks. You guys can, like, do stuff."), and the other players lacked direction for their characters. But then Zach took the lead in creating a driving force out of left field: Shamus's starting item, an urn with his father's ashes, needs to be laid to rest! So the Irish Dockworkers are off on a quest to do just that, cheerfully shrugging off the escalation of tentacly phenomena along the way (at one point they turn back, convinced that a particular street is guarded by a huge octopus!<br/><br/>After that, we all had little problem making stuff happen, either setting up fun color or dangers as a scene's "GM" or pushing the Survivors into crazy escalating action as the players. My favorite scene-setting bit was this: the Unemployed Clowns exited the Convention Center for their Clown convention, and decided to hit McDonalds. Zach did a fun GMing setup with red spraying the insides of the foreboding windows; the Clowns leapt into action, only to crash in on a childrens' birthday party (the spray was ketchup) and terrify the little tykes. Did I mention the Clowns were utterly reprehensible individuals?<br/><br/>I won't bore you with a blow-by-blow of the whole game; it'd be impossible to really convey all the immensely funny and inspired bits. Here are some highlights:\n<ul>\n<li>The thoroughly repulsive Boils kicking Gacy the Devoutly Religious Clown to death with steel-toed clown shoes.</li>\n<li>The AIG crew standing outside the AIG building in flames (drawn lovingly on our map), with burning dollar bills floating down, having no idea what to do out in the "wild."</li>\n<li> Homeless veteran Ratbone (trait: "Always wrong") talking to a distressed tentacle victim through a cellphone retrieved from a severed arm, everyone (including him) believing he's talking to a rock.</li>\n<li>In the next location, finding another cellphone-with-arm, with Ratbone's voice issuing from it.</li>\n<li>At a strip joint, Homeless Vet, the grizzled, post-traum headcase Moondog, "looting" a loved one in the form of a performer who took a shine to him. "She" has an adam's apple, impressive upper body strength, and her name is Missy Mann.</li>\n<li>AIG iron bitch Veronica, getting killed in a shower stall by the creepy German guy transfer who pins it on the tentacles.</li>\n<li>Shamus and crew lay Pappy to rest in Santa's House of Fun, a creepy Tim Burtonish place with an elf graveyard in the back. Only Shamus leaves alive (a tentacly Christmas wreath is involved).</li>\n<li>When the remaining survivors meet up at the now-massacred McD's, Moondog finally comes into his own as defacto leader--"do exactly what I tell you and you just might <i>live!"</i></li>\n<li>As our heroes flee the city, a gigantic Cthuloid Santa rises from the ruins of the City convention center to claim his domain.</li>\n<li>Facing down federal agents at the Helipad, Moondog and Missy Mann make their last stand. He breaks left, she breaks right, and they charge their way football-style to the copter. Missy takes a bullet for Moondog, who then ascends, mourning his lost love but facing a new life.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175420/#Comment_175420" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-18T23:29:47+00:00" title="October 18, 2008 11:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, bottom line: the game was fun; the premise and way of structuring play are great and spurred us to creative and hilarious play. Playing to cliches and broad tropes was an easy device to get a handle on a whole gaggle 'o characters right away. (the Vets wandering around misinterpreting everything was especially fun. I loved bellowing in my best Crotchety Black Voice: "Don't touch it! Charlie <i>WANTS</i> you to touch it!!") There was lots of pop culture referencing, whether direct cribbing, such as \u201cLeutenant Dan\u201d and the Boondock Saints pastiche that was the Irish group, or more of a \u201ccasting reference\u201d such as my Moondog who was patterned on the dyed-black JFK in Bubba Ho-Tep. And the means of whittling down the survivors is great: when it's time for someone to die, you vote. Thus the ending \u201cprotagonist\u201d group is automatically the characters who most engaged the players over the course of the game. Very cool, and worked out very well in practice.<br/><br/>The actual game structure, though, was awkward, and left us floundering a bit. For starters it was a little hard to hit the ground running and start generating interesting content; on the one hand the GMing was kind of a blank slate in terms of situation, and on the other hand there weren't a lot of handholds for the PCs in terms of motivation to do things. there were technically options, but we floundered in choosing from among them. We ended up mostly picking places on the map to arbitrarily go (\u201cWow, that was a long Clown Convention! let's go hit McDonalds!\u201d \u201cHey, Ze AIG building is in flames. I suggest ve go to zis little strip joint I know to commiserate.\u201d).<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, the the Scene Types themselves (Travel, Loot, Chill, Take Back the Streets, Throw Down) work fine, but figuring out when to use each of them is awkward. Like, at the beginning, before the players become aware of the Tentacle Threat, Chill scenes make the most sense, with maybe some Travel. But Chill recovers Stress, which hasn't been spent yet. Similarly, Zach wanted to Take Back the Streets early on (i.e. have a fight to get things rolling), but that just reduces a location's threat rating, which was all still at 1.<br/><br/>Speaking of which. . .our biggest gameplay obstacle was that the Tentacle Threat seemed to escalate too slowly; in our early scenes there was practically no chance of failing our roll and having someone die. Which also meant there was little incentive to use Stress Points for the D10, work items into narration, etc. We did a lot of futzing around, waiting for things to ramp up, and largely ended up turning on each other in an effort to get things moving (which was great fun, don't get me wrong). I think of the 11 dead characters, only 2-3 were killed by Tentacles.<br/><br/>Though. . .crap, I just looked up the rule in the game text and discovered that <i>this was all my fault.</i> =( I totally flubbed the rule when reading on the fly during play: I was only rolling a single D6 plus threat rating for the Tentacles, not a D6 for each character in the scene. Big difference! Well, damn. At least now you know what happens if the rules aren't followed. :P (though it is a bit odd that your chances of survival scale up and down with the size of your group; by the text we wouldn't have the <i>incentive</i> to backstab, but we wouldn't have much <i>deterrent</i> either.)<br/><br/>As far as clarity of the text goes, actually. . .it's mostly good, especially for a Game Chef draft. Game materials list is quite handy, the list of media influences is great for instilling the feel of the game (I used the list to pitch it to strangers, as well), and the character creation bits are quite clear. One thing we tumbled over was assigning the Threat Rating for locations; we assumed they all start at 1 but it doesn't seem to say that anywhere. The aforementioned scene roll rules are in fact quite clear, my misreading not withstanding, however they seem to bury themselves in the text and were hard to reference, which may have led to my hasty reading.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's a great, fun game, and the biggest mechanical problem was my mistake. I still think there are some tricky issues with narrative direction in the beginning stages, so some more guidance there would be good. As it is, though, the game does do an amazing job of getting a <i>dozen</i> or more characters into play with lively and dynamic portrayals, so that's quite a feat! I'd love to play again. Thanks, Willow!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175439/#Comment_175439" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T07:35:58+00:00" title="October 19, 2008  7:35AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you had a great time!<br/><br/>I have an updated draft I've been working on with a few fixes.  (To clarify your question, local threat starts at 0 for all locations).  One of them is to speed up the early game death cycle; it's slightly too slow even if you play by the rules (and if you only rolled one die, I can see it being like molasses.  Good thing you had lots of Throw Downs.)  Another is to give some more early game direction.<br/><br/>How did you feel the endgame worked?  In the games I've run, it's been rather weak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175449/#Comment_175449" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T09:59:04+00:00" title="October 19, 2008  9:59AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            0s? really? How do you indicate that on the location die? (and hell, if you found the death cycle slow even by the rules, that extra 1 point at the start could help, right?) 'Course, I'd love to see your new draft when it's ready.<br/><br/>So, now that you mention it, the endgame was a bit awkward. We had two throwdowns on the way to the Helicopter, so that it was just my character Moondog who arrived there with his loved one. There was a bit of struggle over how the final scene gets resolved/narrated; Jason set the scene with scores of Special Forces guarding the roof, then we rolled, assuming that the typical "scene roll" still applied (ha! I just realized that with the cast down to just one Survivor, this was the only one we rolled correctly the whole game!). I broguth in every bonus imaginable, spent Stess, etc. . .and tied. So I sacrificed Missy to achieve the goal.<br/><br/>Then Jason was all set to narrate the escape, but I pre-empted him--thinking of it as a Death Scene, thus my narration. I realize now that it wasn't a "Death Scene" per se, just an item sacrifice, but at the time I was really into my vision for the final scene, so I pounced on what I thought was my rules-granted mandate. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So I took over and played up the whole tragic-death angle, with Moondog and Missy's fingertips about to meet and then the gunfire erupts, he screams "NOOOO!" while "she" tells him to go on, to live for her. . .It was fun but it felt a little greedy, being the last scene and such a huge chunk of narration, with everyone else just being audience at that point. But on the other hand, I did <i>earn</i> that right in a sense by having the most popular character. So I dunno.<br/><br/>Jason went ahead and shared with us the vision <i>he</i> had which I pre-empted: the tropps first concentrate their fire on Missy, then Moondog is apprehended and frisked, and is about to be left to die, until a search of his wallet reveals that he's a <i>Veteran!</i> And he is escorted to the copter with honor. I thought it was an amusing ending, but was secretly kinda glad I overrode it, 'cuz it rendered Missy's death just a side note, <i>and</i> kinda undermined the "disenfranchized, marginalized" theme to have Crazy Ol' Moondog suddenly validated by The Man. 'Course, Jason was also the creator of the AIG Employees group, which also stretched the marginalization theme, so maybe he just wasn't quite as into the premise as the rest of us.<br/><br/>Which reminds me, a couple players had something of an urge to build a sort of backstory, which with this much narrative chaos was impossible to really sustain among the whole group and across the scenes. Nick was trying to build, using his Creepy German AIG guy as well as his GM power in some scenes, a whole framework of the Government Conspiracy who both created the Tentacle Threat and is actively controlling its development. It didn't really go anywhere, but that was partly because the Deadly Popularity Contest of the game meant that other characters were the focus.<br/><br/>Anyway, does that answer your question?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175453/#Comment_175453" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T10:56:31+00:00" title="October 19, 2008 10:56AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Joel, the endgame is one of the things I'm keeping a close eye on.<br/><br/>Like I've said earlier, I have a more current draft.

I've been meaning to read the revised doc; I'll do that soon and get back to you. Meantime, I wanted to come back to an issue I mentioned above that you hadn't yet commented on: that the Tentacle player rolling a die for <i>each</i> Survivor in a scene would seem to disincentivize working together for survival--there's very little reason not to turn on each other if the Tentacle Threat scales down roughly with your group size. It's not exact, but close enough. Have you seen this working out one way or another in play?<br/><br/>Oh! And I just remembered another thing that emerged in play! It was weird and kinda off-putting to create a Survivor group, and not play in it. Like, I immediately blurted out "Irish Dockworkers!" and was all set to y'know, play an Irish Dockworker. Then I realized that I don't <i>get</i> to play an Irish Dockworker. . .instead <i>every other player</i> gets to play what I was excited about. It's sorta the inverse of most chargen processes, where you get an idea that you're excited about playing, then you get to play it. (Also, I tried to make up for the loss by adding a lot of NPC color in the Irish scenes, like a nagging Irish wife, but the players ignored it in favor of the Pappy's Ashes Quest.) I guess that's an interesting creative constraint, but. . .it rang a little hollow to me.<br/><br/>Game's still fun, for sure. . .but that's an awkward bit.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176194/#Comment_176194" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T06:41:27+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  6:41AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1:  Actually, the tentacle threat scales fairly well with the number of players.  No matter how many people in your group, it's still going to be threatened.  And that global threat keeps going up, which is the real death spiral.  Really, you need things like positive attributes and item bonuses and stress to keep up with that.  But the game's not actually about trying to get your character to survive.  You have to get to endgame sooner or later.<br/><br/>Also, if you Throw Down too often, people are less likely to support you.<br/><br/>2.

But I'm talking about an <i>excess</i> of backstabbing; even in the Endgame we had constant throwdowns until there was only one left.<br/><br/>Of course, us handling the rules incorrectly threw off the whole economy, so maybe I'm just not seeing what a 'real" game would look like in that regard. Like, our Throwdowns were mainly a product of the game bogging down, and were in fact mainly a product of <i>Zach</i>, who initiated most of them in an efort to keep things moving.<br/><br/>Now that you mention it, I can see that just the Threat rolling more dice to begin with would probably promote a <i>little</i> more solidarity if people want to survive. And the social element is a good one to consider--as in any game that allows treachery, there's a bond of trust or distrust that grows during the game.<br/><br/>Cool. I've really gotta play the game the right way to see if this all works for me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
