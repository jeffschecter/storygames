The latter is people playing from my text without me present.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are VERY VERY different things useful for very very different purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing to remember, there are early-stage External Playtests and Late-stage External Playtests:  Early stage External Playtests are best when they don't work at all.  If this is an early playtest, your goal should not be to have fun or generate buzz.  It should be to hammer the weakest part of your design and hope it breaks in a way so you can clearly see what's wrong with it.  Other folks are going to break your game in fun ways your normal crew never would have even thought of...especially if they've been part of the design process since the beginning.  If there are still parts of the game you're trying to actually test, make sure that the folks at the table know that this is a test so they can have the appropriate expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your design is past the point where you are seeking to discover what parts still break, than your focus should be on practicing teaching the game.  You need to be most aware of what you say and what questions people have.  When you described how to make a roll did people immediately get it or did they ask a bunch of clarifying questions?  If they immediately got it...did they REALLY get it or did they just think they did and actually were off the rails.  I can't emphasize this enough, because this is where the language and structure of your final text should come from.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf halfway through the game people still weren't using "cool feature X" that tells you that in your teaching of the game you didn't emphasize "X" enough...so you can make sure to make a stronger call out in the text.  If people are continually asking questions that jump ahead to things you haven't taught them yet...that tells you that whatever that thing is, it probably needs to come earlier in the text.  If while you're teaching them they're getting antsy or their eyes are glazing over that suggests you're covering things more detail than is needed and you should consider moving some of the rules to optional status or shunting them into a sidebar where they are readily available but clearly not part of the core rules flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words the key take-away for you from late stage external tests is to figure out what works best when teaching the game in person and then making sure the structure and verbage of your text matches how you actually teach the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217036/#Comment_217036" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T14:08:35+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  2:08PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As others have said, it seems crucial to define what it is you want to test, and modify your approach accordingly. I don't think this is anything like a con demo, for example -- the purpose of a demo is to sell somebody the game, while the purpose of a playtest is to find out what could be improved. For example, Ryan's suggestions seem like they are geared towards <i>running a successful game in these circumstances</i>, but that's not really what you want, is it? You don't want to go above and beyond what the game itself provides, if that is going to conceal problems in the game -- you don't want to do things as a GM that a regular GM would not do, prep better or harder, etc.<br><br>That is, assuming you are trying to test that part of the game. I could see a playtest where you try and isolate certain portions for testing, taking extra effort to make sure <i>everything else</i> works well (even to the point of covering over possible flaws in those parts of the game.) It all depends how you want to run it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217060/#Comment_217060" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T15:24:17+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  3:24PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Laying out the character creation chapter and character sheet is about the best I can do before the 26th as far as my schedule goes.

If campaign play is important, replace session with arc. Rinse, repeat.
