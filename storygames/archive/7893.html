I've never ran a game nor played in a game where there was a big book of setting info, and all authority over setting elements was vested in that book.<br/><br/>I want to try it, for the simple fact that I've never done it.  More than that, I'd like to take a crack at making my own.  But, first, I'd like to get some degree of understanding about it.<br/><br/>So, what's it all about?  What's the benefits of using a detailed, established setting?  What's fun about it?  Where might it go wrong (because heaven knows that all RPG techniques, even the sacred Bang, can go wrong <i>somewhere</i>)?  What kind of things do you expect from such a setting?<br/><br/>There any Glorantha fans hanging around? Surely you've got something to say about this.  And what about Over the Edge?  I hear it's got a ton of setting info; does anybody use it?  And what other big settings are out there?

Even if you play weekly for 2 years and never take off time for holidays, that's only 104 sessions. <br/><br/>Even if you commit yourself to using every conceivable piece of a setting, whether fictional or nonfictional, how much stuff can you really introduce in a session?  In a session of of play, I find that I introduce at most 4-5 things of import: a few NPCs, an new location or two, an event, a conflict, and so on.  There'll be some window dressing too, and some things that you think are window dressing might end up being important, and vice versa, but really you're only introducing 4-5 things per session by the time you let the players do anything at all, like fight a goblin or interrogate a witness.<br/><br/>And as the game goes on, the number of things you can introduce goes down, not up, because you have to spend time resolving the important things you've introduced.  So whereas in the first few sessions of a game you're cranking out NPCs and conflicts and people yelling at each other and smoking cigarettes and looking cool, once you're 20 or so sessions in, the players will start sealing up ancient tombs and backstabbing their pal and comparing prison tattoos and those things you've brought in will be taken out of the game, or changed or resolved in some way - and even until they're resolved, they will be batted around by the players and will take up more and more of your session time.<br/><br/>Even at the very maximum amount of commitment to setting, there's a limited amount of time between when your curtain rises and when it falls.  There is just no other conceivable way to decide what gets the spotlight and there never has been.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174978/#Comment_174978" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T15:38:48+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  3:38PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>That's it - and if you think about it, that's all it could ever conceivably be and nobody could ever make it more than that no matter what they did because life is finite and we are all mortal.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Even at the very maximum amount of commitment to setting, there's a limited amount of time between when your curtain rises and when it falls.

One of the adventures is set in 1930s Shanghai.<br/><br/>When I prepped this to run at a convention, I read around the setting. It's astonishing: it seethes with crime and decadence. I read <a href="http://www.talesofoldchina.com/library/all.php" rel="nofollow">a 1930s guidebook to Shanghai</a>, which is a beautiful guide (and well worth reading, if you get a moment).<br/><br/>So that's one reason to use a detailed setting: because the setting itself is superb and you get the pleasure of leading the players through it. The players get to explore this world you've learnt about.<br/><br/>I've experienced this last when playing, say, Call of Cthulhu with a GM who'd learnt about circuses in 1920s America. It's great. You get to wander about this fabulously detailed world. I love playing with Call of Cthulhu GMs who have really read into their setting.<br/><br/>Connected to that, there's something really <i>solid</i> about a detailed setting. You say "Right, I'm wandering into the poor part of town" and the GM says "OK, so there's the docks, where the bars are just hotting up, or there's the slums, where the missionaries will try to convert you. Which do you want?" and suddenly it's like you're exploring a real world. It's a very different experience from saying "Is there a poor part of town?" and the GM goes "Sure".<br/><br/>So that's what's fun. What can go wrong? Well, the GM can write the plot for you, that's annoying. Be careful of writing <i>NPCs</i>: nobody gives a fuck. Many of the World of Darkness settings were very bad: OK, here's Victorian London, and you've got these NPCs! It's no fun to play.<br/><br/>Another thing that's no fun: settings that are like every other setting. Another fantasy city? Why? What's different about it? Only write settings that are <i>actually</i> something new.<br/><br/>I actually detest fantasy settings, because they're often identical to every other fantasy setting, with tweaks. Oooh, you've got a new type of dragon and they're descended from orcs, and there's a desert elf. Well, that's me sold.<br/><br/>But detailed settings, yeah, lots of fun.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174984/#Comment_174984" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T16:42:10+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  4:42PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Are you reacting to something?</blockquote>\nWell, the "that's it?" seemed a bit incredulous to me, so yes!

People buy the new book, read the fiction vignettes and coo at the powerful NPC stats, and then their imaginations get to working. Generally, if you're a fan of an established setting, you have a strong mental picture of it established in your mind.<br/><br/>This is fantastic! Why? Because players will come to the table <i> with all the establishment of setting done for you</i>. You already have a setting that players care about, have invested in, and are informed about. And so they <i>care</i> when stuff happens to it. <br/><br/>Contrast this with starting the game without any setting, where it might take a while to get players invested in whatever it is they collaboratively create. To give a TV analogy: It's like the difference between the "monster-of-the-week" dying and a "major supporting player who's been in the show since it started" dying. The monster might have been really cool and played really sympathetically, but you're still probably going to care more about the person who's been around forever. And so it is with roleplaying settings: it's way cooler to finally face down Llolth, the Spider Goddess of the Drow Elves, whom your players have been reading about for months/years/decades than it would be to fight a spider goddess that your GM just made up last week. (All other things being equal, natch.)<br/><br/>So, if your players do know the setting well already, it's way more effective to play games where you change the setting than it is to play tour guide through the setting as it already is. There's not much point saying to players "hey, look, here's some cool stuff from this setting" if the players are already aware of it. Instead, change things.<br/><br/>So burn Waterdeep to the ground, tumble Gods from the Heavens to walk among mortal men, kill Elminster - and watch the fireworks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175018/#Comment_175018" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T01:22:54+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  1:22AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I almost always play in vast extended settings, because my group prefers long running (multi-year) games, and I love to accumulate setting detail. Yes, it's true that you may only introduce a few bits and pieces each session, but that accumulates easily into folders full of detail, lists of NPCs that have been seen in the past, feast days, cultural details, etc. etc. And there you go, a setting rich game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So what do I then do with all that stuff? What's it for? Well there are a few main things that I think it's about\n<ol>\n<li>Detail : this is the biggest thing. In my mind detail supports the best appreciation of the imaginary space, the more detail you have available (as long as you don't go over the top and bore people) the better, because it underlines the existance of a world outside your own. So it makes a difference to remember that all churches use green candles, not the white used in houses, because the wax is dyed with the juice of a sacred plant (or whatever). Having that detail on hand, and written down so you can recall it, makes a difference to me.</li>\n<li>Imaginitive aid : sometimes I just don't improvise that well, sometimes no one does. Sometimes the group doesn't bring the awesome, and you end up with boring and formulaic stories because you couldn't think of more. Setting drives preparation and inspiration, it gives you great hooks to work with, not just what you thought of that evening, but things that were thought of months ago. In the case of a pre-published setting it gives you seeds you might never have thought of at all, which can be great, because you only have to use the ones you like.</li>\n<li>Continuity : this is related to the idea of detail. All that setting helps you remember things that happened before in detail, people, places, details of how people behave and look. Of course you can remember a lot of that without writing down lots of setting, but it's just easier if you do, and you can extrapolate it as well. e.g. the PCs see a knight of a certain order wearing purple with flower patterns, what does it mean? It may not come up that session, but if you go away and prepare background on those knights, and what the colours and patterns mean, if may never get used, but if it does come up again you have a ready answer that links closely to what has gone before.</li>\n<li>Story : And of course setting drives story. People want to know what was in the town they saw, or the castle they heard about, or the secrets of the magic of the plains people. It provides a pool of story hooks that you (a GM) isn't constantly having to lead, because it's there as tantalizingly in front of the players as the characters. I find this happening a lot in big campaigns, that small setting elements from the past drive new stories without my intervention, because people remember 'oh this is the day we can ask a question of the oracle on the mountain, let's do that!'</li>\n</ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175019/#Comment_175019" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T02:10:03+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  2:10AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The great thing about established settings is the recognition from the players.

It can be good because the pressure of invention is redirected - maybe you have a rigid timeline, or location, or characters, or all three, but those elements don't need to be built from scratch.  Your energy can be spent elsewhere.  In terms of prep, you can draw from reality (which is always weirder than anything you might make up).  Conversely, the "weight of history" or a desire to "do it right" can hamstring actual play if you aren't careful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175077/#Comment_175077" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T10:45:42+00:00" title="October 15, 2008 10:45AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Well, the "that's it?" seemed a bit incredulous to me, so yes!

What is this, a fairy tale?<br/><br/>Seriously, though, I figured that there would be something there that was totally alien to me, a brave new world.  Finding out otherwise was a tad anticlimactic.<br/><br/>Everyone, all of this stuff so far is great.  I really appreciate it.  So, here's some other inquiries that come to mind:<br/><br/>1.  How do you use an established setting effectively when the you're familiar with it, but the players aren't?  When I try making the one I'm planning on, this will be an issue.  Christopher, that HQ thread looks like it definitely has some useful bits about this in it; I'll be reading that presently.<br/><br/>2.  This is kind of a conceptual thing, but here goes anyway.  It seems that the general method with these settings is to put all this info into a guidebook, which the GM (at least) reads, then goes back and looks things up as he needs them.  What about a setting guide that is written such that you don't have to read it before play?  Suppose that the first thing in it is a big map, with plenty of interesting landmarks, and these landmarks all have, say, page numbers by them.  So, say the PCs are journeying through the countryside, and a storm comes up, so they need shelter, and one of the players points at the map and says, "Hey, there's an abandoned windmill not far from here.  We could take shelter there," and then the GM goes to the page number indicated next to the windmill, and, BAM, there's everything he needs to know about the windmill, in some simple, intuitive format that doesn't require him to call timeout and read for five minutes.  I don't know what this would look like, but doesn't it sound cool?<br/><br/>3.  I'd like to hear a few words from folks about what they like about their favorite settings.  Charles, tell me what you like about Ravenloft.  J Anthony, tell me what you like about Harn.  Anybody else who has a favorite setting, weigh in!

The whole point (for me) is to lay out the Situations and Conflicts the Players can plug their PCs into.  As far as I'm concerned (and, again, this is just me) the value of the big settings is to have lots of Situation and Conflict already in motion, with NPCs, Locations and Backstory available to grab as needed to keep feeding the Players choose as those they want to focus on.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> I keep in mind that the PCs can't plug into the whole setting.  They can't.  Leaving the Players out of the equation for a second, the PCs literally can only a specific, and limited, number of contacts between their PCs and the fictional world.  So, the game is to let the Players rummage around the broad, shallow big setting details and the narrower, deeper local setting details.  My job isn't to teach the Players about the whole world off the bat.  It's to draw from the setting to let the Players find stuff that connects what they want to play via their PCs and the setting.  I figure they'll learn more as they go, with what they learn being driven by what they've already declared is interesting to them.  <br/><br/>I know they'll never learn the whole setting.  Who could?  It's a fictional setting!  A lot of details can only be created as play demands, and other pieces that are known (by GM or Players) might never come into play!  (Which means, by the way, I'll never learn the whole setting either!)  But they will learn more about it as they follow the vein of knowledge that starts with the Situations and Conflicts they choose from.<br/><br/><br/>As for #3:  I like the <i>Traveller</i> setting because it implies tons of conflict and situation.  Unlike Glorantha, which lays out the cultures and religions that are in conflict, the GM has to do more work to say, "These are these worlds, and they are in conflict because of such and such..."  But the idea of setting a game at the edges of an interstellar empire strung together with slow communication and travel (ships takes weeks and months to travel from star to star to star and communication can only go as fast as ship's travel, since news is carried on ships) implies all sorts of tensions -- political, military and social -- since cultures on different worlds depend on each other for commerce and protection, but haven't built a unified, cosmopolitan society.<br/><br/>I like that fact that it provides the framework for a setting as rich as, say, Glorantha, but allows the GM and Players to customize a lot of the details to their own interests.  However, the richness of the world and the setting details provide easy access to both how the politics and society "work" as well as details about NPCs, groups, government, locations and so on.<br/><br/>And I love Glorantha.  It does everything I like about <i>Traveller</i>, but feels like you're getting to dig into a fourth grade social studies project as you "learn" how this strange civilization lived.  There is an accumulation of the tiny details of daily life for the Orlanthi, for example, that gives creating fiction in that environment a real sense of weight.  Implications from these details really rock, and end up serving as Bangs in their own right.  The cultures, religions and politics of the land serve as perfect generators for conflict and situation.  The Players hear about conflicts between Lunars and Orlanthi, and conflicts between Orlanthi tribes, and conflicts within families, and bam.... there's already three conflicts to plug into... and we've barely scratched the surface of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175086/#Comment_175086" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T11:52:48+00:00" title="October 15, 2008 11:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I keep in mind that the PCs can't plug into the whole setting.

Avoid the "you are in the library reading the encyclopedia entry for the world" setting dump.  This is almost always boooringggg.  Thing is, for a setting to feel real, you never know when a player might ask a question about something...like in real life someone might say "a japenese tea house" and even though I've never been to Japan I at least have some inkling (right or wrong) of such a thing because I have a superfical "world knowledge".<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters also have a superficial "world knowledge" and the players will expect you to fill in those bits for them.  As such, playing in a detailed setting is a bit of work, because you the GM have to have a superficial world knowledge over all the things your PCs might reasonably expect to have so that you can fill in the blanks.  The temptation (at least for me) is that 1) I get REALLY jonesed about a cool setting and justcan'twaittoshareitwithyou, and 2) It can feel somewhat futile to acquire a bunch of knowledge but never actually use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice for you is this.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Start small.  Like one town / city neighborhood small.<br/>\n2) Keep all your PCs from that town / city, that way the only superficial world knowledge you'll need is what someone from that town would reasonable know about the world...don't let them be from all over the place because then you've radically increased the stuff you need to be able to answer.<br/>\n3) Consider having the PCs be "strangers in a strange land" ala Connecticut Yankee or any number of similar stories.  That way their knowledge is even more limited and you'll have even less to learn.<br/>\n4) For yourself prep fairly heavily the first degree of connections, moderately the second degree, and then only the lightest brush on the third degree.  Here I mean:  the first degree is the people and places the PCs will know intimately themselves, second degree will be the people and places those people know, etc.  For instance if you have a small market city, you'll want to prep heavily the people and places the characters will know in that city, and then have a moderate understanding of the markets the city trades with, and then a light brush over what important issues might be going on in those cities.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, when you are the GM for a detailed setting...you are essentially the Wikipedia of your world (which is one advantage of a historical / real world setting).  So you want to stay a couple steps ahead updating your mental Mindipedia articles, but you don't want (for the purposes you've expressed here) to open yourself up to needing huge numbers of articles to cover everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral" title="grey.spiral"><img alt="grey.spiral" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i148.photobucket.com/albums/s2/greySpiral/boogiepop012hushie1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral">grey.spiral</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175095/#Comment_175095" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T13:00:42+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  1:00PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>J Anthony, tell me what you like about Harn.</blockquote>There's two things I think that I liked about Harn when reading it.
