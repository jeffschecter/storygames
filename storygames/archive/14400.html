It's just friends, gaming is just another kind of social occasion, and if we can't handle each other's dysfunctions then maybe we shouldn't be friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327138/#Comment_327138" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T17:06:30+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  5:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 5:18PM by Ry.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Before we go any further I want to make be clear that I really think everybody's in the same class (i.e. everyone is a "jumbled pile of person")</p>\n<p>Paul, your post is perfect because it shows the distinction I'm trying to make.

Those same people will also understand that when their piles rear up and you call them on it that you are doing so with love. Love or some reasonable facsimile there of, anyway. Sincere honesty at least.<br/><br/>It never seems to be quite that simple in practice but it works a hell of a lot better than waiting for people to change, or spending your time with people with which there is no mutual flow of empathy. I find that sometimes a person has a pile that is so overwhelmingly intense that they don't really have much room for the whole mutual empathy thing. Their pile is all consuming.<br/><br/>So, I guess I'm saying be human, be kind, but be ready to make the hard choices when you realize that a pile (yours or others) is going to destroy whatever it is that you've gathered to do together.<br/><br/>*cross-posted with Ry                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327257/#Comment_327257" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T07:51:43+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  7:51AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>A related question, what do you do when someone is really bad at reading other people's offers / tells, and is driving you crazy?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327264/#Comment_327264" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T08:32:00+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  8:32AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>A related question, what do you do when someone is really bad at reading other people's offers / tells, and is driving you crazy?</blockquote>\nOkay, now *that* is an interesting question.<br/><br/>I've had a few players who are just really bad at engaging at the table. They're engaging just fine with the fiction and with the GM, especially in a really traddie setup where the GM is the player's eyes and ears. But there's no need to sympathize or empathize with the GM in this setup: the player assumes the GM is impartial. Of course this is nonsense in every measurable way, which is why you see tables where some players do a better job of gaming the GM than others, and how the players who don't game the GM can feel resentful toward those other players (although, ironically and probably instructively, do not feel resentful toward the GM!).<br/><br/>Some things I've done:<br/><br/>* Really really emphasize scenes where the PCs are interacting with each other -- and refuse, as GM, to engage with either player while this is going on. I've used the phrase "hub or web?" with players in the past, particularly when you've got a dynamic where every interaction is GM-&gt;Player A-&gt;GM, GM-&gt;Player B-&gt;GM, GM-&gt;Player C-&gt;GM. If I find each player is talking to *me* as GM, rather than to other players, I stop, look at the other player, and gesture toward that player to indicate that that's where they should be talking.<br/><br/>* Reframe or rephrase a player's offer if it's obvious that the crazy-making player can't read the offer. Not as a GM -- that is, not with anything mechanical attached -- but as a facilitator.<br/><br/>* On that note, recruit your better player(s) to become facilitators. Easier if you're the GM, since you're kind of in a unique position in that you're forced to listen to the whole table all the time. I'll often go to my good player(s) and say "You know, Chris is having some trouble hooking into the situation. If you offer to help him in a scene, I'll help prompt him to at least consider it."<br/><br/>* Recruiting players as facilitators also works when you recruit the crazy-making player. I'll even deliver a white lie: "You know, Jason is having some trouble hooking into the situation." (I'll say this to Chris, the problem player). "Can you help me out by facilitating situations for him to hook into? He really wants to play up the rich clueless guy angle, so if he starts acting all clueless, go with it! It'll be fun for him." Or whatever.<br/><br/>* Ask the crazy-making player to GM for a while. It'll teach the player to listen to the whole table, which I think is a skill very much in short supply among players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327266/#Comment_327266" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T08:56:34+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  8:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My only advice is:<br/><br/>Lead by example, and be ready to give guidance when and if they ask for it.<br/><br/>I've seen some truly awesome people who visually change when they sit down at the table.  Body posture, face geometry, tone, everything.  They throw themselves headlong into a game, siezing the short opportunity to make something awesome, and then shift back into themselves when it's over.  I didn't realize what was possible until I met them.<br/><br/>And the flip side, they were able to articulate what they love, and why they do it when I asked them.  It totally wouldn't have worked if they prosthelatized at the table, I don't think... <br/><br/>I'm totally ready to hear some advice from everyone else.
