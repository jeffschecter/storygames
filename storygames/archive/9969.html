And for likely his last game here, he volunteered to run John Wick's new CoC adventure called <a href="http://www.johnwickpresents.com/yellow" rel="nofollow">'Curse of the Yellow Sign, Act 1.'</a><br/><br/><b>Probable spoilers for those who are planning on playing this. You have been warned.</b><br/><br/>So the pitch is that you are in the Central African jungle in 1940, playing Nazis digging after diamonds in an old native mine. But is it really diamonds you are after?<br/><br/>We had six players (the full allotment for the adventure), and I was a few minutes late to the table. So the others had decided I should play the SS Captain, a real control freak who was trying to run roughshod over four (count-em, four!) SS Leftenants of various usefulness, a Wehrmacht sergeant with a mean streak from here to Berlin, and a dozen NPC soldiers, half of whom were down with malaria. It was a roleplaying stretch for me. No, really.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention a rapidly-depleting group of native workers who were trustworthy enough to keep in a barbed wire cage?<br/><br/>I feel like I should note at this point that <b>I do not like Call of Cthulhu</b>. I played it once a long time ago in my powergaming days, thought the concept of eventual character insanity and lack of shotgun effectiveness against said monsters was a bit recockulous. And I carried that wisdom with me for the past 20-25 years until I decided to humor Robert with his little game. And damn, was I glad I decided to play!<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>The setup was pretty sweet. The characters have been primed with enough mistrust and backstabbing to fill a game of both The Mountain Witch <i>and</i> The Shab-al-Hiri Roach. The other characters were relatively specialized, but I quickly realized Mon Capitan was good for little but ordering others around. Which he did with aplomb.<br/><br/>I thought it was clever that six of the dozen NPC soldiers we had were in the sickbay as mentioned before. Which meant that the officers and sergeant had to get their hands dirty to really guard everything at the same time.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>So while the sergeant was busy reducing the number of natives seemingly on an hourly basis, several leftenants went down to the end of the mining shaft and found a strange and large symbol made of solid gold, guarding two old wooden doors full of strange writings in relief. So under the Captain's orders, they brought the gold symbol into camp, and one of the suspect Lt.'s did a pencil etching of the writing on the door.<br/><br/>Eventually the doors were opened, and several officers and men started to explore the ancient caverns below. Without going into a lot of story detail, the sergeant got killed relatively soon into the game. Torn limb from limb by the natives, really. Karen was playing that bastard to the hilt, and was disappointed at first until she realized that she got to be even more evil as a ghost!<br/><br/>From that point the group split off in several directions to explore the caves, people started getting very paranoid, sanity checks were made and points were lost.<br/><br/>The game started to come to a head when the SS Captain in charge started to lose control over the situation and his men, put two officers in the dog kennel, got drunk on brandy and Lili Marlene. With one of the Lt's starting to go insane and putting visions in his head, the Captain put a Luger is his mouth and did a Rommel.<br/><br/>At that point, things were going downhill quickly. I think perhaps one officer survived the encounter. And I won't ruin the surprise to say why he did.<br/><br/>Total game time was close to 4 hours, of which 20-30 mins was setup.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/><b>What I liked about the game:</b><br/><br/>1. Great setup. Loved that the characters were already at each others throats.<br/>2. Playing Nazi Uberjerks was really good fun. I haven't heard so many bad German accents since Robert had me watch an episode of 'Allo 'Allo.<br/>3. We didn't need to actually "see" a cthulhu-type monster to have some really disturbing scenes. The horror was pretty subtle and it felt like a good movie or a book.<br/>4. The "ghost" rules kicked ass, and I loved that players of dead characters could switch gears and have a totally different effect on the rest of the game. I think The Mountain Witch hints at this type of ghost play, but this scenario really nailed it for me.<br/><br/><b>What I didn't like about the game:</b><br/><br/>1. I thought our sanity rolls were way too easy to make. With a one-shot adventure, even with losing rolls, we were never going to lose enough sanity points to make a difference. As a group there was a disappointed groan whenever someone made a successful roll! This was saved in the game by the "temporary" sanity rules and by our deciding to roleplay this dummkopfs to their terrible ends. I'm not so sure this would have gone so smoothly at a con where the players didn't know each other.<br/>2. We didn't made very many non-sanity rolls. I would have liked to see our skills have more of an effect in the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221318/#Comment_221318" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T00:25:15+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 12:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 12:27AM by Mcdaldno.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br/><br/>at a Vancouver Gaming Guild meet-up last weekend, we played this same adventure.<br/><br/><b>MASSIVE SPOILERS - read only after playing</b><br/><br/>This was the first "adventure" I'd played in a long time, which was an interesting experience in and of itself. We had a lot of fun.<br/><br/>One of the lieutenants (the gay one) became obsessed with 'reading' the knowledge tubes, and instead of returning to the base for supplies and rest he stayed down in the chamber reading them. The captain is the first one to head back down. Lieutenant gives him a speech about how meaningful a captain he was, how inspiring he was, how he always made a difference in one's life. The guy playing the lieutenant had shifted to this creepy deadpan tone, and I almost thought the character was possessed, at that point. He continued to explain how the captain was special, and then suddenly his speech transitioned into mentioning that a voice had spoken to him and told him that sacrifice was necessary, and that for so special a captain, that sacrifice indeed <b>must </b>happen. He then raised a gun and... pointed it at his own head. Click. Bang. The blood splatters everywhere. "Alright, and... roll for sanity."<br/><br/>Another sweet scene: I was the disfigured lieutenant with the torture and psychology skills. Early on, two guys (NPCs) had become hypnotized after touching the seal. I had one tied up at base camp, and after we all scouted most of the chamber/shrine/dungeon, I returned to find out what he saw. He had this CREEPY grin on his face (our GM had a good creepy grin face) and started to tell me "what they really think". I start interrogating it, trying to find out what the guy saw when he touched the seal. The creepy grin and the whole persona vanish, and he's suddenly just a guy. He's terrified, but remembers nothing. Then he switches back to the demon persona, which informs me that one of the other lieutenants (the gay one) wants to kill me because of what I know, and that he's planted explosives in my bed. Then the persona vanishes again, and the guy with amnesia comes back. I sweetly say to him, while untying him, "Listen, I was mistaken. You know nothing. I've tied you up and hurt you and I feel ashamed and stupid. You need good rest, to recover from this incident. But your bed is probably lumpy and small. I'll let you sleep in my bed, to recover. Only because I feel bad about this silly error of judgment." I pass a roll (Psychology?), and lead him to my tent. I say goodnight to him, grab my rifle from beside my bed, and make haste. Moments later, I hear an explosion from behind me. "Rat bastards," I say, as I make my way to a hiding place outside of the mine entrance. I decide to wait there until my "comrades" re-emerge, and then shoot them dead.<br/><br/>Issues I had:<br/>1.) My character (creepy disfigured guy) had vital information missing from his sheet: there was no mention of the dirt he had on the gay lieutenant.<br/>2.) Task-based resolution with no clarity around stakes is hard for me to stomach. Partially a GM issue.<br/>3.) Sanity loss wasn't drastic enough. I had 55 at the start and 53 at the end. I feel like everyone should have lost 15-50 Sanity over the course of the adventure, possibly with someone going mad. Are there not special, ramped-up, con rules for Sanity loss? There should be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221332/#Comment_221332" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T01:20:06+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  1:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 1:21AM by Johnstone.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just about to chime in and say me and Joe played this last weekend! And then he beat me too it.<br/><br/>I do not like the CoC rules either. And I played the shit out of them back in high school and had some amazing times.<br/><br/>One interesting thing happened because of the rules however. My character, the British spy, was in a gunfight with the Thule Society spy, in the dark. Because of the whiffage factor - my character did 1 point of damage, then dodged a bullet - we ended up making a truce and working together, instead of trying to kill each other. It helped that we already had a sacrifice (the captain), and that the other characters had trapped us inside the temple by detonating the mine entrance. Unfortunately, the only way out was for us to teleport to another dimension...<br/><br/>And then Joe's guy and the sergeant drive off into the sunset, after a tense confrontation. "Blam!" one of the other players says. "And we don't know who shot who."<br/><br/>As for the rules:<br/><br/>Some monsters aren't made of 100% normal matter, so guns don't work well on them. It's conceptually sound, but actually leads to lots and lots of dynamite. Ask Luke Crane about this, I'll bet he has a good rant in him.<br/><br/>This adventure seemed like it was more about player vs player stuff, and less about monsters causing insanity, which was a risk, though small (for some characters anyway, my guy's SAN was way too high). The rules for temporary insanity (losing 5+ points at a time), and indefinite insanity (losing 20% in an hour or two) are written in a manner suggesting that the player loses control over the character. That might be one reason a writer would keep San loss somewhat low in an adventure -- although frankly, that's an easier problem to fix than not enough San loss in a one-shot.<br/>(As an aside, Joe, if you want to play a CoC one-shot with 15-50 San loss, I could run one for you.)<br/><br/>We didn't have any of the "ghost play" in our game. Chris, could you tell us a bit more about that?

I started with the standard "one guy sees me and the others don't" kind of games, appearing to those who didn't know I was dead. Then I started going around the table and whispering in everybody's ears, pushing their paranoia and goading them into killing others or themselves. I kept telling the scarred Lt that when the dogs barked it sounded like they were calling his name, in the hopes that he would approach them and get mauled. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobert let me peek at the GM notes for how to push each character, so I tried to play on everyone's weaknesses -- telling the Captain that the Lts didn't respect him and were going to seize command, heightening the tension between the scarred Lt and the gay Lt he was blackmailing, telling the Allied spy that everyone knew his secret. The other Lt had already gone insane by that point, so to him I was actually a sympathetic figure. While he was being held in the dog cage he and I had long conversations where I would try to convince him to drag the others back to the altar and sacrifice them, but he was too into the nihilism by that point to see the reason behind any action.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that it was impossible for people to lose any sanity, we gave up and just started playing the sanity loss regardless of what the sheet said, because it was what the story needed. I also wish that people's secrets had come out faster, the betrayals and backstabbing didn't get going until right at the end. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my first CoC game and I loved it. Oddly enough the first Mountain Witch game I played was set in a similar time, with a group of Allied soldiers trying to sneak into the Eagle's Nest. Both games were good at setting up a lot of distrust between characters, and I especially liked the fact that in the CoC game there were no "good guys". Everyone was a bastard, and playing an unsympathetic character makes their untimely demise that more satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221382/#Comment_221382" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T06:38:04+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:38AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>We didn't have any of the "ghost play" in our game. Chris, could you tell us a bit more about that? Maybe an example?</blockquote>\nIn our game, the murderous Sgt. Grimm (Karen) haad gotten himself killed by storming into the slave cage ( leaving the door unlocked) and started shouting in German at the poor prisoners, demanding an explanation for what sort of evil spell they'd woven on his men, while brandishing his luger. This was after having had visions whiile opening the doors to the temple and being confronted by the Man in Black in the hospital tent. Lt. Missgunst arrived just in time to slam and lock the door to the cage behind Grimm, and someone failed some sort of check and the natives finally just mobbed and tore apart Sgt. Grimm.<br/><br/>At which point, we broke for a quick lunch. When I got back, I took Karen aside and gave her a clip-out of the section talking about "So you're dead" from the pdf, and asked her if she'd ever seen <i>American Werewolf in London</i> or <i>The Shining</i>. She was amiliar, and spent the rest of the game re-appearing as a taunting/tempting ghost of Grimm, and occasionally as The Man in Black. Since not all of the characters were aware that Grimm was dead for some time, this led to much hilarity.<br/><br/>As other characters died, they too were given the clip out and the "big reveal" document regarding the nature of Ahvril and the Yelllow Sign in the scenario, and too engaged in haunting.<br/><br/>____<br/><br/>Other game highlights:<br/><br/>Matt K as the Ahnenerbe member was just absurdly intriguing, at once obsessive about his psuedo-science theories, then completely nihilistic as his mind became overwhelmed by insight into the true nature of the universe.<br/><br/>Capt. Hasbucht shouting at the other officers to explain what was really going on after an encounter with the MiB: "Just tell me in simple, nazi language! I was a baker before the war!"<br/><br/>The scarred Lt consistently taunting the closeted, blackmailed Lt throughout the scenario, then finding himself disarmed, trapped in a dog-pen, and completely at the mercy of said Lt. His spittle-spewing final rant was a wonder, right before said gay Lt put a single bullet through the blackmailer's forehead, then calmly walked away.<br/><br/>The two final, remaining, mostly-sane, Lts have just gone off with explosives to re-seal the mine. After doing so successfully, they hear the sounds of the vehicles being driven away by the remaining soldiers, who'd been left alone and had just spend the better part of the previous 24 hours awake and being issued contradictory and inexplicable orders by pretty much all of the PCs. At which point, the British agent revealed himself by putting a bullet in the back of the much surprised fellow Lt ( and I think the player of said Lt was himself more than a bit surprised), and walking towards where he hoped he could meet up with the coming British patrol.<br/><br/>Karen narrating in the wounded, just betrayed Lt waking up to realize that he was being carried somewhere. He opend his eyes fully, only to see that the people carrying him were all of the dead officers and the place they were carrying him to was the mine...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221418/#Comment_221418" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T09:46:28+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  9:46AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic notes!<br/><br/>When I do the print version (with all of the Acts collected), I'm adding "Further Madness" section, detailing actual play stories from myself and others and more Keeper advice on how to drive folks mad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221425/#Comment_221425" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T10:17:12+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 10:17AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to note for the record that Karen DID have Sergeant Grimm pull out a Luger and pistol-whip someone.<br/><br/>Really, every game we play has some Fiasco in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221466/#Comment_221466" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T12:32:05+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 12:32PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I didn't see the information about the closeted lieutenant on my character sheet.

Gregor Hochmut to weigh in on the conversation.<br/><br/>For starters, unlike Dr. Bennett or Karen, I love CoC and have loved it for more decades than I should probably admit. Ever since my high school buddy, Peter Hudson, freaked the sh!t out of me with a creepy skeleton appearing in an upstairs window of a creepy house my detective had to enter, and then after I shot it clean in the skull, had it simply <i>draw smoothly backwards out of sight into the darkness</i>, I was hooked.<br/><br/>Anyway, Robert's game session rocked. It was great fun. Dale played a perfect enigmatic Lt. Soren Faulheit - I knew he was up to some game but we didn't find out he was a f#cking British spy until the end mentioned above. Brilliant. Chris was picture perfect as the "never dirty my hands" Captain Kort Habsucht. "An interesting gold symbol down in the mine, you say? Bring it to me." His suicide was a shock and my favorite moment. Karen's doomed, hateful Sergeant Johann "Pretty Boy" Grimm was an elemental force and we were all surprised by the manner of his death, then delightfully haunted by his ghost. Devon's Lt. Bernhard Begierde ("Lt. Beergarden" according to our Captain) and my character formed a bit of a partnership during much of the game as the academic types and we drove the exploration of the mines. Foolhardy, yes... fun, hell yes. When Begierde talked a shaken Missgunst into the dog kennel with my character, I wanted to nominate Devon for an academy award on the spot. And Elliot's Lt. Rambert Missgunst was the distrusted and hated among distrustful, hateful Nazi scumbags. He was crafty, plotting and busy as hell. Unfortunately for his scheming, when he finally got to my Lt. Hochmut in the kennel (scenes worthy of filming, I might add), his torture and psychology skills were sort of useless, as Hochmut was so far gone, he didn't care about spilling his plans. That was kind of anticlimactic in a funny way. "Oh, my secret mission for the Fuhrer? It doesn't matter now... all is dust!"<br/><br/>CotYS:DfaDG was certainly not like any other CoC game I've ever played - it was a complex, fragile bit of work that we needed to help along for one simple reason: The tension of the game depended primarily on the inter-player conflicts and agendas, but very little incentive was provided to reveal one's secrets. I don't fault John for this - I think it's really really challenging (especially in Call of Cthulhu) to create viable incentive for players to make their characters vulnerable. The richness of the game is in the web of deceits that might be woven between the characters but it's hard to enjoy or appreciate that richness in game when there's no good reason to put your character at the mercy of the others by willingly revealing any of your interesting backstory. So much remains under the surface, especially in a one-shot environment, until a post-game review (if there is one) has each player going around the table explaining his or her otherwise mysterious behavior. It's a tricky situation and I have no real solve for it. I will direct those interested in the topic to Sean &amp; Justin's excellent "Narrative Control" podcast, episode 32, for a great discussion on secrets in games.<br/><br/>Other (rather minor) quibble: The mind-blasting message of the Yellow Sign is the nihilistic truth that there is nothing out there, no intrinsic meaning in the world, nothing beyond this mortal coil. And yet... there is this mechanic allowing for ghosts and spirits which was splendid and fun and added so much to the adventure. I decided to ignore it during play but it's philosophically inconsistent unless I missed something.<br/><br/>I think the sanity loss thing could be gamed pretty easily, as was previously discussed, by making some mandatory loss occur, followed by a SAN save to keep from losing even more. This adventure is a purposeful train wreck and part of that fun is in having despicable Nazi sh!tbags go screaming over the edge or shoot each other in the face (or back!) or all the above. Losing it in one manner or another should be much more likely. Perhaps we can hit two birds here: Upon losing X sanity, your character must reveal some salient feature of his backstory as he screams or mutters or giggles or stares into the starry sky and rocks back and forth. Just a thought.<br/><br/>Anyway, hope these comments add something to the discussion above. We had a splendid time with a splendid Keeper and a splendid round of players. Heartily recommended.<br/><br/>"Lt. Faulheit, why did you shoot Lt. Begierde in the back? He understood. He <i>understood</i>."<br/>"Why? He was... unhelpful."<br/>"Oh. I see. How many of us are left?"<br/>"Only you and I."<br/> "Well, then... twinkle, twinkle, little star..."<br/>"Twinkle, twinkle."

Basically, they experience the doomed last moments of the unpronouncable aliens first-hand.<br/><br/>I did start to feel a bit like those should probably simply have been gimmes, with a San check after-the-fact, raher than before to receive them at all.<br/><br/>As for the ghost-play, while it's in the rules, Karen really took it and ran with it. If I were to run this again, I might well have an even more direct GM write up to hand to players whose characters had bought it, giving them an even more GMish role for the ghostly visitations. Of course, even dead, trapped, and insane, Grimm was still an SOB, and maintained some sort of personality, so that may have thrown off some of the experience as well.<br/><br/>Also, if I understand the nature of Ahvril correctly, the personification is the human mind's attempt to defend itself, to rationalize the infectious meme by giving it form. Essentially, Ahvril exists only as a warped contsruct in their own brain, which is why he takes on a culturally specific form. The sort of tempter demon aspect is the victim's own brain driving them on to commit more and more grotesque acts untilthey can finally accept the completely existential nature of the universe without any longer needing that personification to lead them along.<br/><br/>So, in a way, a bit like the Shadow in <b>Wraith: The Oblivion</b>. But, y'know unlike the scary tough-love nature of Shadows in that game who eventually lead trapped spirits into acceptance of their own deaths, Ahvril is there to plunge you and the whole world into meaningless nothingness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221727/#Comment_221727" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T15:01:53+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  3:01PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Robert Earley-Clark is unfortunately moving to NOLA very soon.

At the beginning, if you're the Keeper, you give a peptalk.  <br/><br/>"Guys, I want to know how much SAN damage is fun for you. The best way for me to find out is for us to start playing, and then, when it's appropriate, for your character to do one of the things that accompanies SAN loss - you know, faint, scream, fight-or-flight, or ham it up a bit, like Ol' Dirty Bastard or even Hannibal Lecter.  We'll handle the mechanical SAN loss as an <i>effect</i> of your reduced-sanity behavior, rather than the <i>cause</i>. [If I did this now, I'd point rightward, and then leftward...]  If you beat me to the punch, which will be more fun, we'll scale the SAN loss to your character's behavior; if you leave it up to me... [menacing cackle].  Don't do that. Seriously, I'll roll a random indef insanity effect for you, and it will derail the fiction, and we'll all wish you had taken the reins for the rest of the night."<br/><br/>In practice, I mix things up.  I do some of the classic "OK, you see a Horrible Thing, roll, oops, faint!"  But a lot of the time, I say "You see a Horrible Thing!"  And then the players, who have read the rules and know the genre conventions, roll their own SAN, and think a second (they don't know the mechanical result of their failure yet, but the genre dictates the fictional effects), and then they narrate. "[Roll] Oops. Yeah, and I totally lose it, and go berserk!  I charge the Horrible Thing and beat it down with the barrel of the antique shotgun, tears and snot streaming down my face! [Starts looking for 'Large Club' on charsheet]."  And I take that as a signal from the player that he wants to play CoC to the hilt, and I'll make sure to challenge his characters' SAN more often, and also to guide what happens next: I consider that we've got a 1/1d4 monster, say "-4 SAN?" and look around the table.  No objections? There rarely are. That's the effect on the character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
