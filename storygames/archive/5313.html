I would like to sketch out the great landmarks, the aesthetic trends, the developments, the big "aha!"-moments that have shaped the hobby during the course of its life, since its birth back in -74.<br/><br/>I'm looking for the big BANGS! as well as the subtle, gradual changes in attitude. The sudden challenging of a dogma, as well as the processes that brought that dogma into existence in the first place.<br/><br/>Now, a lot has happened the last 7-8 years or so, but that is just a fourth of the entire history of the hobby, and I would really like this chronological proportion to be reflected by the textual proportions in my text. <br/><br/>So, from your, purely subjective, point of view (remember that it's supposed to be a <i>subjective</i> history of ideas): what would you consider to be the landmarks of RPG history? And as previously stated, I refer to the aesthetic or ideological history, rather than, for instance, the economical \u2014 so "WotC's buying of D&amp;D" does not qualify.<br/><br/>Grateful for every answer.<br/><br/>- Karl                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119555/#Comment_119555" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T21:01:55+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  9:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Karl,<br/><br/>You might find <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/fashions.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> by John Kim helpful.

Inititally, I had this idea about being really thorough and scholarly, and, like, interview people and stuff. But it seemed overambitious for my purposes. That's why I decided to make the whole thing a little bit more impressionistic.

It changed the way gamers understood the nature of game scenarios. I'm unaware of any metaplot-driven AD&amp;D scenario published prior to Dragonlance. Prior to Dragonlance, the characters were basically the center of the universe. And for all practical purposes, their actions were what the world reacted to. But Dragonlance was the opposite of that. It was a plot that dragged the players along for the ride.<br/><br/>It was a massive publishing initiative that had the effect of unconsciously educating gamemasters that this is how a campaign is supposed to be done. Dragonlance became the way we did things. Even when we weren't playing Dragonlance, we emulated the structure. We created plots and pushed the players from event to event. Dragonlance was the template from which future campaigns were made. And it was the template from which future companies were made. I can't say I've ever played a scenario of Vampire or Werewolf that that hasn't featured significant events that were entirely pre-plotted by the GM or the published materials he was using. And what was a series of modules to TSR became a series of core books to White Wolf.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in some coverage of the earlier GMing shift from open to closed worlds if you can find a good source. John Kim maybe? Or someone with a comprehensive archive of Alarums &amp; Excursions?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119673/#Comment_119673" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T10:54:09+00:00" title="January 15, 2008 10:54AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RPG.Net had an interesting series of RPG history articles, again more focused on companies than on Actual Play.<br/><br/>When I saw the thread title, I thought of those brass plaques they have in London.
