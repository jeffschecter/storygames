If you don't have or haven't played Agon, I recommend: A) that you correct that oversight <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/>, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> that you check out the <a href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/agon_sample_0720c.pdf" rel="nofollow">the sample</a>; it should give you enough information to know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So, your Name die in Agon makes you better at everything.  I find it very amusing to link that to popularity in high school.  This leads to an avalanche in my mind.<br/><br/>Agon has heroic traits.  Replace these with clique membership.<br/><br/>In Agon, part of your character's name is "Son/Daughter of [Name]."  Replace this with "My Mom/Dad is a(n) [Occupation]."<br/><br/>In Agon, there are 4 broad categories of skills, with 4 specific skills in each.  I replace these with:<br/><br/>Core Subjects: Math, Science, Social Studies, Language Arts<br/>Electives: Art, Music, Computer, Home Economics<br/>Extracurricular Activities: Sports, Student Council, A/V Club, Theater<br/>Disciplinary Record: Fights, Substances, Absences, Attitude<br/><br/>Yes, this makes your character sheet look like a report card.  Yes, this is awesome.<br/><br/>Your characters compete to be the most popular, so that your name will go down in the history of the school!<br/><br/>Am I crazy?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61096/#Comment_61096" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T14:46:09+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  2:46PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And you fight in the hallways, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61099/#Comment_61099" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T14:59:32+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  2:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested to see how you port over Agon's potent and elegant monster creation system, but will most confrontations just be extended non-combat conflicts (which Agon can do)?

It's a very decent game. That said, I don't think it's the be-all and end-all of high school gaming - and frankly, I don't think the creators intended it to be.  First of all, it's very specifically Japanese.  A lot of the mechanics and a hell of a lot of the text is geared specifically towards the Japanese education system.  Second, the whole psychic thing - not really applicable to the high school genre at large.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not, y'know, making this game to sell or anything.  It's something I might someday play with my buds, and maybe post on my blog for people whose tastes, through some kind of weird space-time anomaly, happen to coincide with my own (much like the conversion I did of the Iron Kingdoms setting to Spirit of the Century's mechanics).  So, the accusations of stepping on another game's toes are a little off-base.  It's not like I'm trying to slit Panty Explosion's throat and stuff its body in a black bag.  Hell, I like the game.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm really just totally jazzed about Agon.  I played a very successful couple of sessions with it lately, and want to see if I can stretch it into some other weird shapes.  Frankly, I don't see anything negative coming out of that.  So, y'know, rock on with your gaming and all that jazz.  Keep it positive.  Also, formatting and punctuation are important tools for clarity and ease-of-reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
