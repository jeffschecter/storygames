So I thought I'd give it a try here:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I ran a Star Wars-flavoured session of Dogs a few weeks ago, with great success. I didn't modify the rules in any way, except suggest that the accomplishment/initiation conflict deal with the Jedi's relationship to the Dark Side. That's why I'm calling it "Star Wars-flavoured" as opposed to Banthas in the Vineyard or whatever you will.<br/><br/>Since I haven't run Dogs a whole lot, I wanted to stay loyal to the setup of the game. I had the young, virgin Jedi travel to a small backwater planet where a small low-tech village of humans with a culture of polygamy and patriarchal family roles were experiencing some trouble. Sin, anger, fear, etc, attracted the influence of the Dark Side, which tempted common folks to greater pride and violence, and gave extra strength to those who gave in.<br/><br/>The result was that we pretty much played Dogs straight up, except that the Dogs were called Jedi and carried lightsabers instead of guns. In every other way, it was just a regular game of Dogs, to the point that we sometimes forgot entirely that more advanced technology existed, that the Jedi had unusual abilities, etc...<br/><br/>None of this was bad: we greatly enjoyed the game, and our goal was just to expose a few more players to DitV as well as have some fun, so it was a success on all fronts.<br/><br/>But I realized that there's something I'd really like to hear more about. Despite all the discussion of how to modify the rules to make Dogs work in other genres on this forum, I haven't seen any discussion of how people build Towns or create stories in a different format. Because using the Town creation rules straight-up works really well--in fact, in preparing for this game, I was really surprised how much bang I got for so little prep. But preparing a standard Dogs town and sending some moral authority into it is never going to create something like a Star Wars story. It's still Dogs, you know? ...Just with some different sauce on top. Because Dogs is all about the troubles that crop in small, isolated communities with strong communal traditions.<br/><br/>All those "Dogs in other genres" threads (from my limited reading) don't seem to share the end product, just rule modifications and setting details people make before playing.<br/><br/>So, those of you who have run Dogs in other genres successfully:<br/><br/>* What did your prep look like? Will you share your "towns" with us in this thread?<br/>* How did those stories play out?<br/>* Did you still use an episodic Town-by-Town approach where the Dogs visit a place, make judgement, and leave, or did you follow something more like a typical "RPG campaign" with an on-going story arc?<br/>* Have you ever run a Dogs game that totally broke the standard Dogs mold (like a long-term story set in a huge, sprawling city, say)? If so, how did it go?<br/><br/>Thanks! I'm looking forward to more DitV in my future, and I hope this thread will bring some of you out of the woodwork to share your experiences, caveats, and recommendations.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>If you didn't read all that:<br/><br/>* Share a Town that's not a Town.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reaction" title="reaction"><img alt="reaction" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reaction">reaction</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229941/#Comment_229941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T20:39:11+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  8:39PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have much to add, except the sheets I banged together for a Jedi in the Galaxy hack I never finished.<br/><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/jediinthegalaxy/Home" rel="nofollow">Character Sheets</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229965/#Comment_229965" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T00:14:27+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 12:14AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs is the best game to play Jedi with, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really don't need to change much.

I wrote up my experience of running a Jedi game and provided my interpretation of a rules hack. We finally finished the game last week.<br/>\nI will provide the files I used once I get to a grown-up pc, but for now I'll try to provide my impressions of how it went and how the town was created.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was my second time running dogs, and my 2 players had never played dogs before. Over the two sessions, I ran it as play is suggested. Hit them hard with everyone coming at them fast and furious demanding, pleading, lying and threatening them to help. The scenes were short, sharp and focused and I think the players were a bit shell-shocked at the pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used the town creation tools from bantha in the vineyard (fear leads to prejudice...) and although I found it easier to come up with a town using vanilla dogs town creation rules, I was still able to present a setting in crisis that challenged the Jedi master and his padawan.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod, this is painful and probably quite disjointed as well. Sorry. I'll post a more coherent response when I don't have to use a teeny-tiny touchscreen keyboard. But basically the game rocked and the lads seemed really amazed at the freedom they had and were soon being all bad-assed Jedi doing bad-assed force stuff in no time (say yes really comes into it's own here) and while we won't be playing it as a regular campaign, it is going to be our go-to pickup game using the same characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain my apologies for a disjointed post. More coherence will follow...<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230276/#Comment_230276" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T08:53:32+00:00" title="September  6, 2009  8:53AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the replies so far, but no one has really stepped to my challenge so far:<br><br>* Share your prep for a Dogs game that was either a) not a Town, or b) produced play or story that was not like a Dogs Town.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230278/#Comment_230278" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T09:01:33+00:00" title="September  6, 2009  9:01AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also interested in hearing people's answers.

This sort of story is very strongly linked to the genre trappings of the Western, but it shows up in other places too: Kurosawa's Yojimbo, virtually every episode of Dr. Who, several episodes of the original Star Trek series, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's Walking Tall (big 2x4, 2d8), Carlito's Way, etc. etc.  Structurally Dogs should work fine for any of these: you're just changing the incidental color.  The interesting questions in stories like this are all about, "How did the town get this way?  How far will the people go to change it (or resist changing it)?  What does the aftermath look like?"<br><br>Star Wars however is a little bit different.  With the exception of the unwatchably tedious Phantom Menace, none of the films are telling a town-tamer type of story.  Instead, it's a pretty standard bit of issue-driven face-stabbing, the kind you'd see in many other Forge-type games.  The issues at play involve "Love vs. Duty" and "Feelings vs. Reason," among others.  Structurally, the films are sort of like a Bildungsroman, a story about a character's moral growth into adult responsibilities and commitments.  (I'd argue Han Solo undergoes this sort of transformation as well, even though he's an older dude.)<br><br>So while I think you can have a Dogs game in which the Dogs use lightsabers instead of pistols, and call it a Star Wars game, it isn't really Star Wars on a structural level.  I don't know exactly how to use Dogs town creation to handle a Bildungsroman plot structure, but I'll give it some thought.<br><br>Also, make sure that any lightsaber battles you have, occur in horrid industrial hellscapes.<br><br>P.S.  The first season of Ugly Betty strikes me as a potential Star Wars type of show, if the fashion magazine were the Evil Empire and her father were the last of the Jedi...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\n..that is why I'm really curious how a Dogs game turns into a non-Dogs story, if it's possible, what it looks like, etc.<br><br>If you've done it, how did it go? How did you prepare? How did the mechanics change the type of story told from what you intended, if at all?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230650/#Comment_230650" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T14:47:32+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  2:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Star Wars however is a little bit different.

Really, just run Dogs at least once to get the feel for it. Better a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer your questions:<br/>\nSo what was the game like?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was and wasn't not like Star Wars. All the flavour of the Old Republic was there but the Jedi seemed mortal and isolated in play, always appealing or justifying themselves with their Lightsabers. There was one scene where the female Jedi was dueling a misogynistic Jedi master and ended up proving she could murder just as well as one of the boys.

What do you hate? What's an issue you give lipservice to? What are you ashamed of?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe initiation conflicts are key. I like to do a few of them for each character to get the ball rolling. Like, what was the most difficult trail during your time as padawan? Tell me about a time when you got in a fight with another PC? (Usually, I just say: Start a fight with some one else at the table.) Between those two, you can get alot of good fodder for the rest of the session.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did it all turn out?<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty well, although we only ran it three times, and disjointedly at that. We played it when someone bailed on the session because everyone loves Jedi and you can easily run a game of DitV or similar with two players. To this day, if I have nothing prepared and am on the spot it's either GHOST/ECHO or Banthas in the Vineyard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, that my 'style' of GMing. Instead of taking control by saying "This is how it is; whaddya gonna do about it?" I'm all: "So, tell me about your mother."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230696/#Comment_230696" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T19:20:32+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:20PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once upon a time I had an idea for a Nobilis campaign that I would have called Gods in the Vineyard: dealing with an Imperator with a larger than normal mystery cult in the process of corruption (taking both the 'multitudinous mystery cult' and 'corrupted mystery cult' properties). The 'situation creation' guidelines, in my head, looked a little like this:<br><br>Somebody 'sins' against one of the Imperator's estates (Usually in a manner that also defies the Imperator's Code). What do they do? (If applicable: who do they do it to?)<br><br>What caused that to happen? Who is involved?<br><br>What caused the thing that caused it to happen? Who is involved?<br><br>The 'sin' opens the doorway and allows Excrucians to begin corrupting stuff. What do they do to make things worse?<br><br>What happens as a consequence of that? Who is involved?<br><br>What happens as a consequence of the consequences of that? Who is involved?<br><br>And then basically taking the usual DitV advice of figuring out what everybody involved wants from the PCs, since they're in a position of penultimate authority regarding the cult. (I also dig how characters in Nobilis can use divinations to get all the information about a situation pretty much instantly, since "Get information about a situation to the PCs quickly" was one of the most memorable bits of advice in DitV GMing chapter to me.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230743/#Comment_230743" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T03:06:36+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  3:06AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my upcoming Padawans in the Outer Rim game (which is SW Dogs but with padawans during the Clone Wars who are sent off on dignitary missions while the jedis fight in the war), I took a Dogs town that was already posted up, renamed NPCs, built a planet around the town and changed some of the situation to be more like Star Wars.

I'm not the only one. Firefly though, unlike Star Wars, has the added benefit of already being part western in setting. However, the morality of Firefly shifts significantly from that of Dogs. So I had some help, read a lot of forums, and came up with this:<br><br><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26582.msg253887#msg253887" rel="nofollow">Brainstorming thread on the Forge</a><br><br>This link includes town creation. I see there's a few newer posts on the Forge about DITV and Firefly, you should hit those up too. Looks like they have the detailed thought processes you're looking for.<br><br>Really, when adapting the setting, I think its all about defining:<br><br>1. what the Morality is going to be defined as for the players (is Firefly it was "Stayin Free" being criminals out in the black, vs Dogs' "I am the law")<br>2. who the big bads are (Firefly has Alliance instead of Demons)<br>3. creating towns that are centered around those central issues, and NPC's that bring them out (Firefly towns, in my mind, have a decidedly "good guys fightin the man" feel. so issues arise having to do with government oppression and oppression in general)<br><br>I'm also trying to use a similar formula with the Farscape game I'm currently running. In Farscape, the morality shift is very similar to Firefly: individuals trying to be free of the politics and evil in the galaxy that always tries to drag them down. So its about independence, doing the right thing when doing the easy thing is sometimes more beneficial, betrayal and trust, and the issues that lie in huge wars and interracial conflicts. Whew, lots to cover there, right? In this aspect, it's a lot like star wars.<br><br>So, I've been tailoring my towns to these themes. I don't write them out quite the same way as you do in DITV, but I create NPC's and conflicting interests, and reasons the NPC's want to fuck with the PC's or want things from them. I think the most useful thing to do is create <b>3 Situations</b> (three factions that have conflicting interests) at all times, no matter where they are or what they're doing. That way, someone in the setting will always be in conflict, and the PC's will always have something to unravel. <br><br>So far, my most useful Farscape prep has looked like this:<br><br><br>Episode 1:<br>\u2022\tCharacter introductions and showcases of the best things they can do<br>\u2022\tIntroduction of themes in the game and of the show<br>\u2022\tShowcase of the ship<br>\u2022\tGiant ship explosions<br>\u2022\tAn exciting plot that touches on everyone\u2019s interests<br>\u2022\tCreate interesting obstacles that trigger the characters\u2019 aspects<br>\u2022\t\u201cThe Revolution\u201d The one thing the characters have in common is that they are outcast from their societies, mostly because they are at war. <br/>\u2022\tIt\u2019s a combination science station/resort station, meant to make revolutions around a dying star in order to study exactly how it dies while simultaneously providing a beautiful and romantic getaway. All kinds of metaphors in there.<br/>\u2022\tOn the station is the PC\u2019s ship! It\u2019s their only chance at escape.<br/><br/><br/>NPCs: <b>(these are my three conflicting interests, embodied in NPC's)</b><br/>Kcrackic \u2013 the lead Zenetan Pirate Captain Villan<br/>Vaken \u2013 the head scientist on the island stations of Pais Courant<br/>Raylen \u2013 an enterprising young worker girl planning on selling some of the goods<br/><br/>\u2022\tThe pirates want the stash the PC\u2019s have, and then they\u2019ll leave.<br/>\u2022\tThe workers on the station want to rebel but they need guidance and help from the PC\u2019s.<br/>\u2022\tThe scientists are studying the rock in relation to the time dissonance surrounding large stars, and want the PC\u2019s to leave them in peace.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
