I originally thought of this for games that have Social and Mental pools, but this would also work great for a game like D&amp;D with very large pools that grow even bigger as characters level.  So I wanted to share what I came up with.  I'm sure it's probably not original.<br/><br/>The pool is called Resolve.  If one wishes to break into Physical, Mental and Social, then there can be 3 such pools (Physical Resolve, Mental Resolve, Social Resolve).<br/><br/>The purpose of the Resolve system is to decouple the gameplay currency of an available pool of 'hits' with any narrowly interpreted single character stat, such as Endurance, Health, Sanity, Composure, etc.<br/><br/>A character who runs out of Resolve has simply been foiled by their opponent.  I call this becoming 'locked out'.  It is up to a GM or player to narrate what this represents based on the situation, rather than based on any stat.  The only limitation is that if one uses multiple Resolve pools, then being locked out occurs only within that pool.<br/><br/>Example: Marcos falls into a match of insults with an uncannily clever beggar who started haranguing him from the street corner.  Over the course of a few rolls, Marcos is now out of resolve.  No further attempts on his part will have any effect on the beggar; he is simply at a loss for words and can't find a way to outwit him.  It's up to Marcos player and the GM how to handle roleplaying this.  Perhaps Marcos looks stunned that a beggar came up with such witty repartee.  Perhaps he shakes his head, disgusted that he lost and storms off.  Or maybe he pretends that he one, but backs off and retreats.  The point is that since we didn't call the pool 'Composure', the player isn't going to be scratching their head wondering how to roleplay a complete loss of composure in a fairly mild scenario.  Losing Resolve simply requires that you cannot continue your attack or defense and must give up somehow.<br/><br/>What about injuries and wounds?  That depends on the system.  I originally wanted this for a game based on FATE, which already has a separate system (Complications) that represents injuries.  So in the case of Marcus and the beggar, if the situation has high enough stakes, and it makes sense, then perhaps the beggar could land a really nasty insult that gets under Marcos skin so badly that he loses his temper.  But this will depend on any given situation.<br/><br/>For something like D&amp;D, one would need a way to inflict wounds (I came up with an idea for this, this morning just for fun after thinking a bit about it).<br/><br/>How does Resolve refresh?  That also depends on the game.  The simplest way is to refresh every encounter or scene.  But for something like D&amp;D it would be more like every night since dwindling hit pools during exploration is a staple of play.<br/><br/>In Dresden Files or WoD I would go so far as to point out what each scenario a Resolve pool applies to.  For example, if characters get into a street brawl with a vampire and some thugs, I would probably track the Resolve pool separately for each.  If a PC runs out of Physical Resolve while fighting the vampire, they could fall back and switch places with another PC and move over to beating up the more vulnerable thugs.  But the vampire has truly foiled them.  So one pool against the vampire, and a second pool against all the thugs.  Obviously this kind of pool depletion would need to be tracked on a piece of paper or note card instead of on the character sheet.  It's a little more tracking, but I don't think that much.  If they were in a large scale battle on a battlefield, I might let them know that their resolve pools apply to the entire battle itself.  Once depleted, they simply can't go on.  It's flexible enough to allow interpretation for each situation.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to try this out.  Maybe it will click with someone else too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457886/#Comment_457886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-06T11:56:21+00:00" title="November  6, 2016 11:56AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For D&amp;D or any other monster heavy game, you could also do cool things when pools deplete.  A truly frightening creature might have an ability that when one adventurer runs out of any resolve pool while fighting it, it causes all other nearby party members to take 2d6 attack from fear at watching their comrade's futile failure.<br/><br/>And in general now you can have all kinds of attacks, not just physically damaging ones.  You wouldn't need to track illusory or non-lethal damage separately, they would all reduce resolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457915/#Comment_457915" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T04:02:31+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  4:02AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should take a look at:<br/><br/>* Fate<br/>* The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>* Burning Wheel<br/><br/>...for pretty solid implementations of precisely this kind of "resolve" tracking.<br/><br/>I like the idea of attaching larger-scale consequences to "resolve" loss, especially ones which affect other characters.<br/><br/>Imagine playing D&amp;D where (for example`s sake), at half your HP reinforcements break through the gate and join the enemy, or at a quarter of your HP the sorcerer's ritual is complete, and if any character loses her HP completely, the captured hero is killed.

I think they could have been more straight forward about what stress represents; and I prefer Resolve as a descriptor for exactly this reason.  Stress had me thinking that a character breaks down in some way when reaching 0.  They do require wounds to be taken afterward, whereas I prefer to allow the table to interpret what a total loss of Resolve means.  Mechanically the character simply loses any chance or capability to be successful in the current contest.<br/><br/>I don't know if any game keeps track of multiple instances of resolve pools for multiple contests/efforts, though.  If I go this route, I should probably keep the pools small.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458063/#Comment_458063" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-13T18:57:16+00:00" title="November 13, 2016  6:57PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday does this, a little.<br/><br/>This game looks like it does exactly what you're suggesting:<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=8717.0" rel="nofollow">FarFlung</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
