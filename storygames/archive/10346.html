Unfortunately, for various bureaucratic reasons, I won't know my job status until Tuesday or so (and I need to stay in the area until then and probably longer, since I won't have long to find housing if I get an offer.) I've been here for the better part of a week, stuck way out in Maryland with relatives, and feeling badly socially deprived.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone around this weekend and up for some story gaming? I can't really offer up gaming space, seeing as I'm a guest in my grandparents' house, but I can go anywhere you are so long as it's public transit accesible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all so much! Hopefully I get this position, so I can game with some of you on a regular basis, with more advance notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229955/#Comment_229955" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T21:57:23+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  9:57PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Anna,<br/><br/>I can't offer you any gaming this weekend, but if you end up living in DC, here's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9538&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">a thread I started not long ago</a> that is chock full of DC-area gamers willing to add a chair to their tables. <br/><br/>Good luck with the job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230009/#Comment_230009" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T06:58:33+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  6:58AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Anna,<br/><br/>Where in Maryland? Anywhere near Owings Mills / Baltimore? I'm about an hour from the northern edge of DC. 95-north, 695-west, 795-north for 6 miles, then a couple more turns.<br/><br/>I'm having a small party Saturday that will be full of gaming geeks -- mainly online text-based role-playing game (read: MUSH) geeks -- all geeking about our particular shared game, <a href="http://firan.legendary.org" rel="nofollow">FiranMUX</a>, but there is a small chance of tabletop gaming. If you want to meet some people, you're welcome to stop by. Whisper me for details.<br/><br/>And fingers crossed for you getting the position!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
