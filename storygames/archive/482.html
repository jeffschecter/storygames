                    So, my brother ran was at an auction and ran across a lot (as in 'an (collective) item for auction' - not 'a bunch of') of gaming stuff.  He bought it for a song and got a crapload of Battletech/Mech Clix stuff, which is why he bid on it.  There was also a shitload of D&amp;D stuff - including rather recent material.  <br/><br/>He doesn't play d20, so he sent it to me.<br/><br/>And so for about the last week, I've been paging through book after book of D&amp;D material - Forgotten Realms stuff, various sourcebooks.  At first I was appreciative of the windfall (I mean, about $600 worth of free gaming books - who wouldn't be!), but I wasn't sure that I'd ever crack them open.<br/><br/>And slowly, ever so slowly, I've been getting hooked.<br/><br/>I mean, I have a lot of very transformative ideas - integrating board games and RPGs, open gaming frameworks, creating a <i>lingua franca</i> of game design.  But I mean - what about just making a d20 sourcebook about ... I dunno ... umber hulks?  What about bringing all of this Story Games stuff back to d20 and changing the discussion there?  What about Levi's Perfect20, or maybe a step further?<br/><br/>Or maybe just wallowing in the sheer d20ness of it all?<br/><br/>Am I losing my soul, or am I finding Nirvana?  It's so hard to tell.                </div>

                            First of all, I've had problems with the entire concept of d20 to begin with, from multiple angles.  It's basically a risk-soak for WotC, but at the same time it refrains from being a truly open/copyleft architecture.  I saw and worked with a lot of people who got burned badly in the d20 bubble - plus, I believe that d20 has only reinforced the very VERY fucked up three-tier AAA-only distro system.<br/><br/>But that's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>I loves me some D&amp;D - I always wind up going back to it, no matter how far afield I go with other ideas.  But if you're going to stand up a game and say 'this is mainstream gaming', d20 is it.  And there are a lot of things that are wrong (IMHO) with that model - at its core, its consumerist, its emotionally unchallenging ... <br/><br/>So that makes the case that maybe a lot of what goes on here at the fringe needs to come back to the mass of gamerhood that makes up almost 80% of the market.  That you can change the game from the inside out.  But is that what I need to spend my time doing?  <br/><br/>It's not guilt, really - its just a question of priority and, to some extent, artistic integrity.                        </div>

                            Kuma, <br/><br/>I wouldn't spend my life doing d20 material (says a guy who just finished another OGL project for mass distribution) -- but playing it? Hell yes. Its fun for what it is, and that's what it should be.<br/><br/>Even writing for it can be fun, so long as you keep your eyes on what you're doing. The issue isn't about "doing this or doing that" it's about "doing all the things I want, just taking time to do them in the right order." <br/><br/>What do you really want to be writing? Right now? Because the two aren't the same question.                        </div>

I've been pondering about doing a D&amp;D3 game as an upcoming campaign -- I'd call it "Dawn of Fire".  cf. My <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/tag/dawn+of+fire" rel="nofollow"><b>LiveJournal Dawn of Fire Posts</b></a>.  My idea is to try to play to the strengths of D20 by having the primary action be fighting monsters in dungeons, but to radically change the context and meaning.                        </div>

Yes, I definitely believe that some of the ideas that have been born in the Indie community need to be brought back home to the D20/DnD mainstream.                        </div>

you obviously know the story game thing and as we have seen there is no shame in NOT RUNNING IT STRIAGHT OUT OF THE BOX, so play with it and take from it what is good.<br/>
<br/>
if you asthetically have a problem with the rule set the is Levi Kornelson's open content Perfect20 variant of the D20 system (I am so lazy, I clipped that from John's site) a system that works with D20 and allows modification ifg needed.<br/>
<br/>
Above it was pointed out that D&amp;D does the fighty well, but they also do background and color pretty well. I say play the hell out of them while they interest you push the system to find as much fun as you can and when you get tired of the stuff give the rest to toys for tots.                        </div>

You know.... I never thought of that before.  Why?  Seems so obvious and quite honestly a healthy thing to do.  I love playing DnD3e.  But I am always left wanting just a little bit more out of it.

                            I'm not seeing the "soul-sucking" part. D20 is an interesting game engine with a lot of cool shit out there for it. Hell, I'd buy a PDF of that umber hulk thing if it was relatively cheap, I own a ton of monster stuff like that. I collect it for the "fantasy world magical scientists" game that I'm thinking up.

                            I dunno. I recently had my falling out with D20 so I may be more jaded than most. D&amp;D is a cool thing for what it is, but I couldn't stop trying to make it something else, and that caused me a lot of pain. If you're gonna play D&amp;D, embrace it and go with it. Not that anyone has suggested this, but don't go trying to make it a heavy-Nar game. It'll just break your heart.                        </div>

                            Can I speak up as really out and out hating d20?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, really.  Maybe it comes from growing up on R. Talisorian games instead of D&amp;D, but the d20 system is kind of bad.  I'm all about you freaks who like it liking it _over there._  I got no problems with that.<br/>
<br/>
Until d20 CoC.  Played 4 sessions of that.  Loved the group, hated the game.  I mean, the whiff factor alone got to me.<br/>
<br/>
And, quite apart from the Microsoft-like cargo cultism of Open Source which is the OGL, I feel like there are some really awesome game ideas that have been packed into the gibbet of a d20 supliment because of the market pressure of "d20 is what sells."  I mean, doesn't System Matter anymore?                        </div>

                            D&amp;D is a strategy and tactical game that rewards knowing trivia of the setting and the mechanics of the system. That's what it does, and it does it with great greatness.<br/>
<br/>
The main function of the system, near as I can tell (and I'd like more insight into this from people who like it and have played it more than I), is to 1) give you an opportunity to make strategic decisions, 2) put you in a tactical situation that gains or loses you resources for the next strategic decision point. Failure means starting from scratch, success means getting more resources and doing it again.<br/>
<br/>
If that's what you want, it's the tool for the job. I totally understand that some people like it, and I think I understand why they like it. I get the strategic and tactical thrill from other venues that I find more satisfying, and I find the trivia stuff weak compared to material that we can create in the course of play.                        </div>

                            D20 is one of those systems that gets out of the way for everything except combat, although Spycraft's chase system (and later, other additional systems for things like investigations and searches) shows that it's certainly extensible to make cool mini-games in a lot of different areas.<br/>
<br/>
I think there's an element of gambling to the bog-standard D20 combat minigame, too. In other words, the complexity is such that you just don't know if you can do it or not and you might or you might not, you don't know until you roll the dice.  The challenge rating system is an attempt to be sure that there's a range of potential challenges that you can count on seeing and do what you can to increase your odds of success.  Gambling is often overlooked as a component of traditional play, I think. There's a reason that millions and millions of people go and gamble despite losing a lot. Gambling is FUN.  And while there are some tactics and strategy involved in gambling challenges, it's a very different sort than a chess game.  That's why very strategic and tactically minded people can get frustrated with D20 mini-games, the element of gambling.                        </div>

                            I very much hated D&amp;D 3.5, and its associated collectible miniatures line, when it was released. They went in and nerfed up random rules, just enough to break compatibility, and threw "versimilitude" into the dumpster. And I sure as hell wasn't gonna spend another $90 on rulebooks I'd already purchased.<br/><br/>Then I realized that the changes they made simply optimized the game for the gamist aspect of the rules, and had stopped trying to please everyone trying to run fantasy simulation with crappy statistics or fakey railroaded storytelling. This is an improvment over the previous attempts to be everything to everyone.<br/><br/>So it's a swell squad-level tactical miniatures game. It's got this neat character improvement game in it. There's tricks to learn for better winningness. Played this way, it's kinda fun. You get nice physical components to play with too.<br/><br/>All of that is a preamble so I can sound more even-handed when I say D20 sucks. It's great for somebody. It's just not what I'd like to be playing.                        </div>

  Well, I guess its a question of design goals:<br/>
D20: Reach a wide audience. work with an existing system, maybe try and influence mainstream gamers<br/>
Non-D20: Make a complete system, work without restriction, maybe try and create a new mainstream<br/>
  I don't think there is a right or wrong, its what your design goal is.<br/>

It looks like fun because you're working inside a really large framework.  I've seen it written a couple of times here that the current incarnation of D&amp;D works best as a tactical monster-killing game.  Reading through a lot of the supplements as I have, I think that, on the surface, that's very true.<br/><br/>But it also is a very open-ended framework - and I think that there's a lot of room for expansion and reconfiguration - particularly in the story-game direction.  At its core, D&amp;D is just Stat + Skill (+Feat), with a lot of derived statistics (saving throws, BAB), within a level structure.  The value judgements about D&amp;D are mainly baggage beyond that.<br/><br/>Surely there's a whole universe of room for working within that structure, and hooking into a crapload of Stuff (the accessory books) that you don't have to re-invent the wheel.  I mean, the core books that I have almost reach my knee - that's a masive pool of resources to tap for raw material.  The idea is to tap it in an active Situationy way instead of on the 1" square map.                        </div>

                            You nailed it, Kuma, that's the great challenge of the d20 glut - nailing down the fenceposts. People who whine "it's so tedious leafing through 100 books to find the right feat!" are missing the obvious answer - don't leaf through 100 books. Get what you need and make it yours, all yours. Even if you have a group of books that form a "line", there's never any need to incorporate everything. The same thing that is true for the old World of Darkness books is true of the d20 mountain of material - it's all where you say "stop, that's all I need for right now".                        </div>

                            Just an aside, really. At my wargames club, along with "real" wargames (DBA, etc.) we also play AD&amp;D 3.5 in a wargame-style. Characters are known by their class or race with a name that is pretty much disregarded. The Situation is a lose tactical objective ("take out this fort full of Orcs; clear out this temple dungeon") in a very loose campaign (the big-bads are Ravagers -- I think they are canon, but if not they are fantasy version of Firefly/Serenity's Reavers). It's a tactical wargame, played out with figures and a battlemat, and it's great fun.<br/>
<br/>
Then the same group (more or less) can play Dogs in the Vineyard the next week and have great fun with that too. Use the correct tool for the job.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It's notable that this group shun - strongly - anything White Wolf and trad-RPG fair. I would suggest anything incoherant, but I could be reaching there.                        </div>

                            As JDCorley mentions it is all about where you say "stop". I think a big reason for the decline in RPGs is the spoon-feeding of well-marketed content. When I started playing Traveller (as an example) we had three books.<br/><br/>Three books, and we created a universe that worked.<br/><br/>If it wasn't there, you just wrote it.

                            I think you are on to something, Ross, regarding cheap, simple, all-in-one-box games versus needing $100+ for gorgeous full-color encyclopedias. But I have to agree with Vaxalon that the "decline in RPGs" is a dubious notion. I never seem to find enough financial data to determine sales trends myself.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how this directly ties in Kuma's original questions about D20, though.                        </div>

                            You're assuming a reduced interest in RPG's.<br/>
<br/>
The big, slick, well-marketed pre-packaged behemoth that was DnD 3.0 and the associated D20/OGL movement brought roleplaying games back from a long decline.<br/>

Most people are sheep, even among RPGers.                        </div>

I find that incredibly hard to believe.<br/><br/>I mean, I enjoy the roll-your-own rough-edge quality of the first RPGs as well - but I can't swallow the idea that more content = less creativity in this regard.<br/><br/>It's not like folks are required to own any of it.                        </div>

                            no, they aren't required, but there is that perception of being "behind the times" as well as the pressure of players to add element x or element y.                        </div>
