It was really fun and ran 30 sessions of epic storyline, but it had 4 problems:<br/><br/>1)  Movement and distance were GM Fiat.  <br/>2)  Damage was GM Fiat.<br/>3)  Characters grew by getting uniformly better at everything and couldn't be customized<br/>4)  There was no magic system.<br/><br/>Red Box Hack, or at least, Red Box Hack isms, have solved all four and look like they grafted gracefully onto what was once Great Knights.  My game currently has no name but I really just wanted to publicly say that Red Box Hack has<br/><br/>1)  A brilliant Arena systems<br/>2)  Awesome equipment and damage systems<br/>3)  fantastic character options <br/>and <br/>4)  Capital-M Magic<br/><br/>each of which has solved a major issue for me and my game.  I have an absolutely terrifying number of drafts of my game where I've tried different designs, going back and forth for 5 years or so (more like 8).  With Red Box Hack as a seeing-eye dog I've been able to put those drafts to bed.<br/><br/>Thanks Eric.<br/><br/>PS: Story Games deserves a nod here as well - if it wasn't for the AP I wouldn't have looked at Red Box Hack for long enough to see where it linked up with what I had been trying to do all these years.  You guys are awesome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132205/#Comment_132205" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T19:51:50+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  7:51PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>You're welcome.</p>\n<p>But don't forget to thank Ron Edwards, Clinton Nixon, Vincent Baker, Jason Morningstar, John Harper, and Mark Causey.

I have found in it a gem of a Sword &amp; Sorcery game. And it's realy the fast prep-intense fun RPG I was looking for. People, if you haven't read it yet, don't be deceived by the code name. It's still <a href="http://redboxhack.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>And if you like zombie, werewolf, vampire and bodysnatchers films, go play <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1899567" rel="nofollow">The Infected</a>. I am reading it right now and I realy enjoy it.<br/><br/>Bravo Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132261/#Comment_132261" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T07:30:29+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  7:30AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Ron Edwards, Clinton Nixon, Vincent Baker, Jason Morningstar, John Harper, and Mark Causey.
