We tried this four years ago with Alternity but it wasn't even close to the amazing experience this 2 hour session was.<br/><br/>The cast are all members of a Van Saar gang (Row's Horde).  There are current tensions between the group and a House Orlock gang (Heavy Metal)<br/><br/>Row - Gang Leader - Issue: Obsessed with Control<br/>Whiskey - Juve - Issue: Hooked on Spook<br/>Jericho - Bounty Hunter - Issue: Dark Past<br/><br/>We created the R-Map prior to play coming up with the rival gang Heavy Metal, a Delaque gang which functioned as a loose ally and strong source of information (Slagg's Dogs), a Guilder contact (Grummish the Stag), and the player behind Jericho created a platform for his dark past - Fled a Cawdor gang, killing a member in the process.<br/><br/>We also rolled some random territories on the Necromunda territories chart (this was extremely fun) and came up with:<br/>-Chem Pit (which we decided also included a workshop - the pit being the run-off from the factory)<br/>-Guilder contact (Grummish)<br/>-Old Ruins<br/><br/>We only got 5 scenes in before the night ended but we had a hell of a time.  Scenes included:<br/><br/>-Started off introducing Jericho and Whiskey in a bar inside the settlement of Dead End Pass.  A couple of Cawdor gangers come strolling in and we conflict over whether Jericho is spotted or not (we pretty much decided they were not members of Jericho's ex-gang but certainly this could color the fiction of the future if they took notice of him).  We also established that Heavy Metal function as the watchmen of Dead End Pass and one of the members in the bar gives Whiskey lip before they leave.<br/><br/>-Next we introduced Row as he was meeting outside of their territory with Grummish the Stag.  Grummish was escorted by a group of Escher which ended up causing some distraction for Whiskey.  We had some nice back and forth as Row established his dominating/controlling personality and negotiated a deal.  The Horde would travel to the nearby settlement of Mercury Falls where a group of slaves was being held.  We established that Grummish was a source of slave labor for the group in which the Horde employed in their Workshop.  Grummish would normally deliver the slaves but an outlawed group of Goliaths named Hell's Britches had been hitting the area hard.  Grummish lost a couple of his men on the last job and insisted that if this deal was to occur the Horde would have to pick up their own cargo.  Row did a hell of a job negotiating the guilder down and getting an excellent price.<br/><br/>-Cut to inside Dead End Pass as Row is meeting with his Delaque contact Thrasos.  Seeking information concerning the travel routes the rest of the gang is laying low in the market place as the dregs of the Underhive peddle their wares.  Whiskey gets into trouble (conflict) as he tries to bum some spook off a junkie.  Row is furious that one of his men (much less a Juve) is causing commotion during an important meeting and gathers his men just as members of Heavy Metal approach the scene.  Further damage is avoided as debts are settled (the junkie is paid for the spook Whiskey jacked).<br/><br/>That's all for now.  I'll post the rest when I have more time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
