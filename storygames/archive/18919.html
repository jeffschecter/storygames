You raise an interesting general point though, which is that with high emotion narrative games, perhaps under the influence of, as you say, Nordic larp,  we seem to be moving towards an acceptance of bleed, indeed even an encouragement of it, and a certain amount of what is derogatively termed meta-gaming, i.e. bringing one's own sensibilities into play. When I started RPing, about three years ago, bleed was considered one of the worst possible outcomes in a game, and meta-gaming one of the worst sins a player could commit (it still is in many quarters, and tbh I'm not very comfortable with it myself), but are we heading towards breaking down that barrier? Is that the final taboo?<br/><br/>For the record, and to answer your question, I'm still enough of a 'traditionalist hippy' (if I can put it like that) that I'd currently prefer the second option, that of "staying true to a given character". But you've certainly made me think.

There are obviously going to be very different design methodologies associated with the two objectives you cite- established and fully fleshed-out characters vs one-line archetypes- and I'll need to do a bit more thinking about that.

I'd LOVE to see a copy of the screenplay, and even more the director's notes for all the characters, which would presumably read like the page in the RPG rulebook that deals with the pre-gens. I'll have to look into this- I can't remember offhand all the character archetypes (I last saw the film in the late 80s), the only one I do remember being the fat, sweaty, reactionary bloke who, when Henry Fonda starts in on his 'liberal bleeding heart' stuff, tuts loudly and goes 'There's always one... there's always one'.<br/><br/>In the game I want to explore how people's private agendas, as well as their interaction with other people, and all in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the jury deliberation room, drive their decision-making processes. Forex, Sweaty Reactionary Bloke might vote to convict just because Bleeding Heart Liberal is against, and Police-Hating Hippy might vote to acquit even given the weight of evidence, because he sees the Police as little more than state-sponsored terrorists whose evidence can't ever be trusted. So the innocent get banged up, and the guilty walk.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423176/#Comment_423176" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T23:27:45+00:00" title="October 18, 2013 11:27PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is kind of the opposite of what 12 Angry Men does, though.

I think I should give the film anther watch to see how it handles the discussions, and maybe attend some real life trials too.
