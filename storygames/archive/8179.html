I appreciate what your trying to do with the double talk, the ilove and ihate but at some point it seems you cared less about mercilessly mocking the subject of your game (faceless cooporations and their unrelenting evil and soul sucking devoring , etc) and started caring more about the appearance of mercilessly mocking the subject of the game. I can get into questions of authenticity and all of that stuff, but quite frankly I want you to stop it, becuase meta considerations while reading make a pain in my head.<br/><br/>Secondly, I find that you keep saying the point of the game is mercilessly mocking coorporations and the like, but I really feel that what your game excells at is creating a soap opera. All the key selling points in the world won't change the fact that you go on and on and on about the brand, when in fact you want to talk about soap, so why hide it. <br/><br/>Third, all this asset and freelance stuff with holes in your head, and cordite in the morning and stuff, seem to be detracting from both your stated aim of mocking corporations and the kind of actual aim of creating soap operas. Beneath the language and personal interactions, you have something (a semi near future sci fi setting) that's about as interesting as a list of halbreds. I think if you really want to lampoon something you have to do it where it is strongest, and that myfriend is in the 90's or maybe the 70's.  Something like Mad men the rpg (or Men Mad or whatever to avoid the copyright) but instead I have heADSPACE and computer viruses. <br/><br/>All and All I REALLLY LIKE THE MECHANIC, I'm like damn that 's smooth and chocoloty, It definitely adds some structure for what ammounts to improvised scenettes, ultimatelly what this all comes down to is that, My play preferences are different than yours and your okay with saying "you have to play myway". That said, I'm not sure how many people are gonna get it "your Way" without you or a high generation follower dragging them kicking and screaming down the correct path. If you have to get to a rule like, You can't kill off fellow reps, and all you can say is 'That's just the way it is done' I think you could have explained things (expectations , and intentions for play) better. <br/><br/>Moral of the story, I wanted Sopranos/Dead Like me/mad men/etc  the RPG and you gave me a watered down version of paranoia minus the player killing or 1984 minus the underlying criticism<br/><br/>(I think you may have hit gold with the soap however, a soap opera rpg is something that i haven't thought a lot about. My prediction for this game is , if it is played, I thinbk it will be Hacked)<br/><br/>Thank you for your time, I hope that's Helpful<br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wood" title="Wood"><img alt="Wood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wood">Wood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179994/#Comment_179994" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T07:06:44+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  7:06AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About the "setting": there isn't one. <br/><br/>The thing about those bogus SF elements - and they are bogus, yes, completely - well. The thing is, the game is a straight list of things that companies really do. The bogus SF stuff is there because it would be too true to life (people don't realise, but all that stuff about massacring unionized workers, offering amphetamines to help workers get through overtime, the terms "stabilisation consultants" to refer to paid killers and the term "parallel market" for the mob are all things that happen today). The SF stuff is there to push it into satire. I don't think I was mercilessly mocking anything. I was pushing it just the tiniest bit. <br/><br/>FWIW, the reaction I got since the io9 plug has been massively positive, more among non-gamers than among gamers, interestingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180133/#Comment_180133" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T16:40:25+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  4:40PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alot of this is going to come down to taste , in both sci fi and satire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180186/#Comment_180186" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T05:14:21+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  5:14AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 5:14AM by Rich Stokes.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've taken a look at the game.  My initial impression is generally very positive.  There are things which aren't 100% and where the game needs additional polish: Some of the phrasing doesn't quite read as smoothly as others and the layout needs some TLC, but for a playtest edition these are expected.<br/><br/>I'm really digging the core mechanic: The game runs on tokens, rather than dice.  In order to resolve conflicts you blind-bid a number of your tokens against someone else.  Whoever blind bids the most wins the conflict, and loses all the tokens they bid.  The loser, gives all the tokens they bid to the winner.  If you have a big conflict, where both sides want to win, you're looking at a lot of tokens lost by the loser.  If only the winner cared and bet a lot of tokens, the loser probably ends up handing the winner only one or two tokens.  That's a really damn elegant system, and one I'm really liking.  The emergent behaviours from that seem really interesting in terms of driving those conflicts.<br/><br/>I like the setting/tone a lot.  It's like Transmetropolitan, Sinister Dexter or Eastern Standard Tribe.  I think the humour works very well for me as well, but then, I'm English and dark humour is part of our national make-up <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I don't say this often, but this is a playtest release that I'm really looking forward to actually playtesting when I get a chance!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wood" title="Wood"><img alt="Wood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wood">Wood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180415/#Comment_180415" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T05:05:35+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  5:05AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am really glad you like it, Rich.

But I'm largely happy with it, and I'm particularly pleased that the people who grok it the most are non-gamers.

That alone justifies practically anything that you want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to carpet bomb a whole town because a few workers have unionised, you can bring in your private police force to deal with any whining survivors. And although the cost of calling an air strike is astronomical, you can justify it because it's your brand's air force that profits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to see a relationship map showing how the companies support and oppose each other from a complicated example. Players could work out how to play the companies off against each other to their own ends. You could engineer a Catch-22 situation where it's more profitable for your air force to bomb itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bidding for turn order in the demo did seem overly complicated to me as you may as well pick at random and go clockwise, at least for the first game. You have a number of ways to score soap but what's to stop players from coming up with a TLA and referencing their USP every chance they get? I haven't actually played so maybe it comes out more naturally than I'm imagining.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep it up Wood, I found the writing style amusing but I'm English too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wood" title="Wood"><img alt="Wood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wood">Wood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183047/#Comment_183047" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T08:59:12+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  8:59AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.
