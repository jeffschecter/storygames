And I mean that both in a "teenage mormon cowboys" way and a "growing up/judging people" way.</i><br/><br/>It's about people surviving in a postapocalyptic world. It's hard to explain what it's about in a quick sentence, but it's very much about relationships, betrayal and communities. That's my perception, anyway.<br/><br/><i>What's awesome about it?</i><br/><br/>Nothing. It's quite fun, though. When we playtested it, it was fun but the rules didn't hang together. The new version looks tighter.<br/><br/>The GM advice is pretty good. You have "fronts", which are essentially threats to the player character. For example, one of our fronts was an organised gang of kids with AK-47s. There are rules about how fronts advance.<br/><br/><i>I've heard some stuff about the "to do it, do it" stuff. Is that awesome?</i><br/><br/>No. <br/><br/><i>Also, what kind of stories do you get from it?</i><br/><br/>It seems different between play groups. Ours was about fighting against other groups that threaten you. Other playtests seem more personal.<br/><br/>It's quite a fun game. Do playtest it if you can.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230759/#Comment_230759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T06:08:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  6:08AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It has little books for each character class, with all the rules, choices and colour associated with that class.

But scheduling difficulties have prevented us from getting far enough along for me to really be able to judge whether it does what I think its trying to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the broader question of what its about:<br/>\n<br/>\nLike all of Vincent's games its about community.<br/>\n<br/>\nPuppies was about pathetic outcasts from community forming their own sick version of community<br/>\n<br/>\nPoison'd...hmmm...in many way's you can copy that same sentence for Poison'd too<br/>\n<br/>\nDogs...is...really about the same thing...only with more focus on the community (i.e. the town of the faithful) and their own sick issues to contrast with the Dogs who, while typically not pathetic, are also outcasts (even if voluntarily so) with their own "sick" pathos to endure.<br/>\n<br/>\nApocalypse World is also about (often) pathetic outcasts from community forming their own sick version of community...only the twist in this case is that the community they are outcast from no longer exists (hense Apocalypse) and so ALL communities are basically sick twisted versions of Ur-Community.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo break that down a bit, Apocalypse World is what you get when a group of people who have little reason to care about each other beyond mutual survival are shoved together into a pressure cooker of internal and external tensions.  Initially acting as glue, but I suspect later acting as a fault line is the embedded authority structure among the different Archetypes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't remember all of the colorful names correctly but basically Hardholders are the boss of a shanty town and if you have one in play the assumption is that the other characters slot into the hierarchy of the town in some fashion.  The bike ganger is the head of a biker gang and thus has a similar "man in charge" role.  And the Fixer type guy has a crew with varying possibilites for the other characters to be rivals of or members of that crew.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you essentially have as setting a group of radical independent minded nutters in a power structure based on fear and violence and coersion.   As system you have game mechanics that allow you to interact with each other any way you want but only mechanically back you up if you act with fear or violence or coersion.  And as situation you have external enemies who WILL destroy everything unless you manage to stop them...Go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230803/#Comment_230803" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T09:25:36+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  9:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent,<br><br>I was asking because I'm having some ideas for my own post-apocalyptic game and I wanted to see if we're working the same angle.
