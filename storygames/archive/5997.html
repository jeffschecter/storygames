I was always awkward about this question, in an unconscious kind of way, but recent threads in SG brought it to the front of my mind (don't ask me why).<br/><br/>I see, and read about, mechanics to encourage players to adopt a specified behavior, mostly through rewards. I see mechanics that rewards players that \u201cplay the game (correctly)\u201d. Excuse my French, but <i>c\u2019est quoi cette merde ?</i>. Or, in other word, WTF? While I can (more or less) understand these things from a gamist perspective, what are their relations to narr-games / story-games?<br/><br/>Most of these rewards are of the \u201cif the player does this, the character gains that\u201d kind. Write a compelling backstory, gain XP. Describe a cool something, gain a bonus on your action/conflict test. Invent a part of the setting, gain spotlight time.<br/><br/>I believe I know where these rewards come from. They\u2019re an evolu-corruption of DD\u2019s character progression system, aka leveling. But, imo, leveling is not a reward (to the player). It is a part of the play experience. Leveling is fun in itself, it is a goal of the game. It\u2019s also changing the game\u2019s elements to prevent boredom from repetition. You learn to use your character\u2019s powers and defeat threats-of-his-level. When you\u2019ve done enough, things change before (hopefully) they become dull. It carried very well in video games, with or without character evolution.<br/><br/>When you play other games with your friends, you do not expect the game to reward you for \u201cappropriate behavior\u201d. You play to have fun (or for some complicated social reason). Everybody is expected to respect the spirit of the game (as it is locally, defined \u2014 expectations). If I play team sport, I do not get a game advantage for playing with my team (instead of alone), nor for doing my best to oppose the adversaries which are, in all probability, friends.<br/><br/>So why should any rpg give rewards for respecting the spirit of the game? I can find only two explanations:<ul><li>The game designer simply followed the rewards tradition.</li><li>What is rewarded is a less fun or even unfun part of the game and the reward is there to mitigate that. (-&gt; Is this part necessary? Can\u2019t it be made funnier instead? Can\u2019t it stay optional?)</li></ul>\nIt is some years since I used any xp or other reward in any of the game I run. We do character progression by consensus, considering setting and story coherences and genre expectations. Most love it. Recently, I tried to re-introduce xp rewards in my games, to \u201cpromote good role-playing/storytelling\u201d (eg: I state a mood for a scene; players who contribute to the mood gain xp). Xp can be used to modify characters or act on the setting or on the story. It feels wrong, just wrong, plain wrong. Why should a player that is a good mood contributor have is character improve (that destroy story/setting coherence and spoil my fun)? Or have more rights than another to alter the story? (On the contrary, I believe that he is probably so good because the game suits him more than it suits the others, so should we not bring the game closer to the other players?) Or why limit somebody who has great ideas for the game because he did not earn the necessary rewards-resources?<br/><br/>The only virtue I find to these rewards is that they may add a gamist dimension to a game. However, trying to add these gamisms on a non-gamist game blights the game for purely-non-gamist players while simultaneously not making the game sufficiently interesting for gamist-only players. Not a winning combination.<br/><br/>I am very interested in your views on this matter.<br/><br/>TIA<br/><br/>Ajax                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133959/#Comment_133959" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T08:31:10+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  8:31AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots to think about here, and I was thinking the same way from the "draw a picture for XP" thread. That seemed wrong to me, but it's hard to put a finger on why.<br/><br/>I'm thinking it is to do with the social dimension of the game. Often the reward is for doing something that you may not find as much fun, but which I (some other player) would find more fun if you did do. Maybe you find it fun to wise-crack your way through each session largely out of character voice, but I would love it if you were in-character and respecting the tense situation, hence a reward for doing so. Or I (the GM) feels that other players would like it if you did that, and reward you for that reason. <br/><br/>And of course it is a character reward, because what else can you be given? I would give the *player* XP for playing better, but I can't, so I give them a juicy reward in the hope that, like Pavolv's dog, they will learn to play better? Not sure about that, but it makes a certain sense.<br/><br/>I wouldn't conflate that with XP for character advancement (e.g. D&amp;D levels) though, because that is about what the character is doing / learning, and not the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133964/#Comment_133964" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T09:01:40+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  9:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This does not seem like a good way to solve the \u201cproblem\u201d to me. Are there, in a gaming group, players with expectations / gaming behaviours sufficiently different to spoil the game for some? It happens\u2026 Let them discuss what is fun-generative, what is fun-neutral and what is fun-destructive for each and reach an agreement on how to play.

They're analyzed as two separate thing - as a system which rewards you for your actions, and as a more consensus-driven pacing mechanic for the group. It's both, but it's also analyzed as both separately. (I feel like the latter case is much more common than folks think!)<br/><br/>So, I think that "reward" has semantics attached work well for some folks but not for others. There are many people for whom discussing rewards/incentives/currency totally breaks their idea of how a game should do. Perhaps it's mechanizing or stripping away the important social context that's driving and underlying the play (like you say, respecting the spirit of the game). I think others are more comfortable with having rewards in the forefront of their vision and assumptions about social convention understood, but not in the center focus.<br/><br/>Myself, I'm comfortable with those words - reward, currency - because I when I see them in play, they're ways of working within a social context, of sharing social messages around the table. When "rewards" work with my game play, they're either used to enhance or slightly modify the existing social patterns.<br/><br/>On example for me, Fan Mail in PTA (using a mechanic to give players positive feedback). When I've played with it successfully, there's already a strong social understanding that positive feedback is what we all do, anyway. The Fan Mail availability is a reminder to keep it up, and provides another way to represent that message.<br/><br/>Another spin on rewards: sometimes they're not about rewarding the player but encouraging certain world outcomes. "I get a +20 on my hacking roles when I activate into my flaw." This is saying we're in a fictional world where, if a player delves into their personal flaw, it's more likely they'll achieve some other kind of success at the same time.<br/><br/>I think that something like "rewards" isn't antithetical to your style of play. But, I want to say that I definitely see what you saying. There are times where mechanical reward or impact has kinda crashed the social context in a group. (There are a few games where us freeforming it would have turned out better than that specific group following its mechanized rewards.) When I make rewards, it's clear that we're using the rewards of the system to find interesting outcomes and share information and get feedback (from each other and from the system), but we're ultimately at some level of consensus beyond that about what we're wanting exactly to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133966/#Comment_133966" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T09:03:22+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  9:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ajax: I realized that I mentioned some specific examples above.

Examples are Fate Points earned in Spirit of the Century for Compells, or Artha earned in Burning Wheel for acting out Traits or Instincts even when they aren't in your character's best interest. They directly work against the traditional problem of "roleplaying is suboptimal tactics", which often leads to roleplaying (or using your character for maximum story fun) reducing your in-game power/protagonism.<br/><br/>It's worth noting, too, that a lot of people have weird hybrid approaches to gaming that fit poorly into Big Model CAs. E.g. Burning Wheel - check out Luke Crane's recent post (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5933&amp;page=1#Item_18" rel="nofollow">here</a>), or me trying to make sense of the BWHQ playing style (<a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4641" rel="nofollow">here</a>).<br/><br/>That aside - I, personally, like mechanical rewards because they're Fun! Winning things for doing things is fun, and adds to anything. Accumulating useful points is fun and exciting. This digs in deep with some instinctive "get reward" mechanism.<br/><br/>This thread drives home for me, more than anything else I've seen, that any classification of reasons for gaming (such as the Big Model CAs) has it's work cut out for it. I can't really justify why I like mechanical rewards, any more than I can really justify why I like mechanised social conflict - at root, it's instinctive and I have no idea *why* like it.

The desire for (or hatred of) fundamental things like mechanical rewards or social mechanics has its roots in a deep-seated, fundamentally irrational (a-rational?), unreasoned "Hell yeah!".<br/><br/>Or maybe a guttural roar with no real words in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134003/#Comment_134003" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T10:41:05+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 10:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>Maybe it is because it does not reward the player and does not modify the character, but rather affects situations.</blockquote>\nAjax, by this do you mean it does not modify the character as a fictional entity, or it does not modify the character sheet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134007/#Comment_134007" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T10:54:28+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 10:54AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2008 10:57AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ajax... I don't want to put this all down to defensiveness, but your condescending attitude certainly seems to lean that way. Or maybe I'm just being defensive...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, you say that leveling is fun, but then you say it's not a "reward." I think that, indeed as one of the other posters put it, we've simply got a semantic argument going here. The argument with "rewards" is that a game system will tend to promote certain things by the feedback that it gives. For instance, by our definition, your game does have rewards. No, not EXP. But, then, few of the games here have EXP, either. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe want people to play "Correctly?" Well, no, we want people to have fun with the game. We find that the feedback cycle that incentivizes players to do certain things that we enjoy in play, does that well. That is, indeed, we just want players to have fun by playing the game in a way that's fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, maybe I'm just misunderstanding you. But if you could find one particular system that seems wrong to you, and tell us why it seems wrong (and even better, tell us if you've had any actual play problems with it), then I think we can start a real dialog. I'd be happy to discuss my own game, Universalis, in this regard, if you like. Or whichever. But in the abstract, it sure seems to me, at least, that you're not disagreeing with anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are correct in one thing, for sure... these games are all a reaction to RPGs that promote gamism. But they don't assume that gamism is the norm, or that it has to be combatted. Merely that, as Gamist games promote gamism by being fun to play that way, games that promote other mode will be more fun by promoting those modes. In fact if you read around you may well find that we've gone a long way to talk about this subject and lots of related subject matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Oh, one more thing. This also doesn't mean that we've got it perfectly down, either. Our designs are certainly flawed... just like every design is flawed. Some do handle promotion of functional play better than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134021/#Comment_134021" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T11:34:16+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 11:34AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EXP is not the only thing that could qualify as "rewards".

I can find only two explanations:The game designer simply followed the rewards tradition.What is rewarded is a less fun or even unfun part of the game and the reward is there to mitigate that. (-&gt; Is this part necessary? Can\u2019t it be made funnier instead? Can\u2019t it stay optional?)</blockquote>\nI think you hit it with the first one. I can't think of any games that reward unfun behavior. If you think something is unfun that a game is rewarding you for, you're probably playing the wrong game. If you think something is fun and there's no reward for it in the game, you are probably playing the wrong game.  It's important to recognize that "reward" is generally considered to be some mechanical benefit that gives the player better ability to interact with the game world (usually through a character, but it doesn't have to be attached to a character).  Penalties can be considered a part of this scheme, but for simplicity, lets ignore that facet and just consider them to be a type of reward (an undesirable one). But it's clear that there needs to be common ground first.  Rewards are not just points given to players for them to spend. <br/><br/>So, you're right with your first point, but also wrong.  They are not "simply" following rewards tradition.  They are decidedly following the rewards "tradition" - that tradition being decades of behaviorist research that shows rewards are an effective means of ensuring actions follow a prescribed guideline, and centuries of games that show that if those guidelines are fun, then reinforcing them with a reward makes it even more fun. And positive reinforcement (rewards) works the best and is the most pleasing, so it's no surprise that games, which are meant to be pleasing, revolve largely around rewarding players for following certain actions.<br/><br/>To go back to the example you dismissed.  The +20 to hacking is a reward. It rewards the player for delving into a character's personal issue.  That creates a very different game than one that gives you +20 for having a very expensive hacking deck.  It's hard to say where you might be having a problem from your original post, though.  It sounds like you are house ruling an existing system to have more "story game" like rewards. My guess is that the house ruled method simply isn't working. You may need to make more adjustments, or try another method to get the results you are after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134270/#Comment_134270" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T01:06:51+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:06AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many thanks, you've given me much to think about.<br/><br/>I am sorry that I can not respond fully now, for I have a sudden work overload right now, so I don't have much time to answer.

You'd much rather not get hurt because you ran foolishly into a fight, or not have trouble crossing a bridge because you have vertigo and the like. You want the best *as* your character. Of course the player knows that playing up the vertigo is fun for the game, but when you *are* your character it is not.

The reward systems reward the players, not the characters. Oh, in some RPGs the interests of the character and player are conflated. But in the games we write, we usually stay away from rewarding the character, and instead reward the player (in fact the detractors of our style of play often say that this dissociation is the most problematic part of play). This is how you can get systems where it's fun to have your character fail. Which is the sole key to most of these games. <br/>\n<br/>\nDissociaton of the player's interests from the character's interests, making the player the author of the character, and not responsible for his failures, is the primary shift between other forms and narrativism promoting games. As an example, in Universalis, we award the player Coins for creating "complications" that may end up hurting the characters that we ourselves made earlier in the scene. The player is rewarded for creating drama, instead of being rewarded for character success. And drama requires occasional failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134331/#Comment_134331" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T09:11:10+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  9:11AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Elfs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134335/#Comment_134335" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T09:22:45+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  9:22AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, closest AP example I can think of for me is DitV.

And he's right that it's not an example of a game made narrativism-promoting by it's separation of player and character. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn't make it a counter-example, either. Gamist games can have separation or not - you can make the player win by having the character fail. Narrativism requires separation to some extent. Rather, in games where you're rewards are based solely on character victory, then you're making it likely that decisions will be made tactically instead of dramatically. The hero may refrain from charging in, because it might be tactically unsound, and he'll lose his reward. In a narrativism game, the game rewards the player for charging in, assuming that creates a good theme (it might also reward cowardice or even themes about good tactics, too, for not charging). <br/>\n<br/>\nAny better?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an interesting example, The Riddle of Steel actually rewards theme generation (or at least playing along with your character's themes) by making the character more powerful in combat. So the player interest and character interests seem to come back together again. But that's only becuse the player knows he's getting dramatically generated dice. Very interesting, that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134384/#Comment_134384" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T11:41:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 11:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I disagree that no game rewards you for unfun behaviour.<br/><br/>They often reward you for things that are disadvantageous for your character (like playing up your overconfidence, or poor intelligence, or whatever) and if you are deeply immersed then things that are disadvantageous for your character are unfun for you.</blockquote>\nAlthough I am sure there are games that reward "unfun" behavior, I think that's a separate discussion.

I don't see how a reward for playing a flawed character is "unfun".  If it is, well, that's entirely the player's fault for not picking something they find fun. If I play a character with something like "Coward" that the game will reward me for playing (or gives another player, like a GM, power to enforce it) then that's what will probably happen. If I don't enjoy playing a coward, then it's my fault for making the choice.  Rules can't police a player's preferences. At best, maybe I didn't understand the rules, and if that's the case I need to adjust the character now that I have a clearer understanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134449/#Comment_134449" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T14:00:25+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  2:00PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think he's saying this:<br/><br/>If you're deeply immersed, you pretty much <i>are</i> your character.

Because while deeply immersed, it's hard (or I would claim, axiomatically/definitionally impossible) to consciously think about player-level ("metagame") issues. (I do think it is possible to subconsciously/intuitively respond to player-level rewards while deeply immersed, but there's still a limit to how adroit one can be at maximally responding to rewards that have no in-character interpretation) So if you have a reward structure that gives player-level only rewards, a deeply immersed player will be less responsive to the reward system then she would be she was not character immersed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is maybe even an argument for why games that explicitly reject deep character immersion (perhaps because it is hard to work in with some other goal) are MORE amenable to rewards than traditional games. For example, rewards for "Good roleplaying" always struck me as a little odd, because if I am sufficiently deeply in character, I am incapable of consciously making my portrayal "good" or "entertaining." It will be as good or entertaining as whatever comes naturally from stream-of-consciousness/channeled play. For another example, rewards that come in the form of something like drama points tend to have little value, because I tend to forget/lose the ability to comprehend drama points if I am too character immersed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134613/#Comment_134613" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T12:02:44+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 12:02PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>While I can (more or less) understand these things from a gamist perspective, what are their relations to narr-games / story-games?</blockquote>\nConsider it this way - if I ask you "What would you do if an intruder was trying to break into your home and you had a gun in your hand" you might have an answer to that. Now the question is fairly specific, but it can be more specific. For example, there are two intruders and you have three bullets. And my question can get even more specific, perhaps morale rolls involved - ie, my question has random factors that I can only describe the question to you through a random element.<br><br>Also, the more comprehensive you answer, the more we can get into the question I've posed you.

Sure most of the time I am enjoying playing my coward as cowardly, but sometimes I just don't want to. Sometimes I just want to be brave. Various games either reward you for acting cowardly anyway (they give you currency, or XP, or something), or try and make you do it (you have to roll something or spend something to overcome your flaw) but either way the system is trying to persuade you to do something that you, the player, would rather not do. Accepting the bribe doesn't make it fun, it just makes it a little less painful.<br/><br/>Now why isn't that about rewards for narrative promoting RPGs?

That doesn't make them bad games, it just makes them games that you don't enjoy (what makes them bad games is when they tell you that you will have fun and you don't, but that's another thread).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135013/#Comment_135013" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T00:30:34+00:00" title="March 15, 2008 12:30AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2008 12:31AM by noclue.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ajax, Josh is a know <i>Polaris </i>hater.

Can\u2019t it stay optional?)</blockquote>This assumption that players will always choose fun behaviors and that if they have to be rewarded the behavior must not be fun, is an interesting one. Players choose behaviors for a variety of reasons, many of which can diminish fun, ignorance, habit, insecurity, competitiveness. Many of the behaviors that yield the most fun can put a player in unfamiliar territory. Just because they may need a little encouragement to get past their resistance, doesn't mean that the behavior will be less fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135015/#Comment_135015" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T02:14:19+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  2:14AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, a reward can make something that is already fun, in something even more fun...<br/><br/>(I mean, you give a cup to someone who win a race: this mean that winning is really unfun, and you wouldn't do it without the cup?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135097/#Comment_135097" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T10:18:09+00:00" title="March 16, 2008 10:18AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2008 10:18AM by noclue.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Also, a reward can make something that is already fun, in something even more fun...<br/><br/>(I mean, you give a cup to someone who win a race: this mean that winning is really unfun, and you wouldn't do it without the cup?)</blockquote>\nGood analogy.

Here are my reactions and explanations\u2026<br/><br/>I\u2019ll try to catch up as soon as I can.<br/><br/><br/>It is certain that I have an \u201cinstinctive\u201d negative reaction to rewards.<br/><br/>Rewards often make me feel like I am treated like an idiot:<br/><code>The Rules \u2014 Sit! Good dog, have a biscuit.<br/>Ajax, definitively not sitting \u2014 Bark! Bark! Growl!</code><br/>Positive reinforcement\u2026 Seriously! I\u2019d much prefer being treated like a responsible adult. If you want something, can\u2019t you simply ask for it?<br/><code>The Rules \u2014 You might enjoy playing like &lt;this&gt;.<br/>Ajax \u2014 Sure, I\u2019ll give it a try.<br/>The Rules \u2014 However, it usually takes some time, usually two to four sessions, for things to fall into place. Many people first experience &lt;that&gt; or &lt;that&gt; instead of the desired &lt;this&gt;. Don\u2019t despair and persevere. Trust us.<br/>Ajax \u2014 Ok, I\u2019ll keep trying.</code><br/><br/>Alternatively, rewards can make me feel like I am bribed.<br/><code>The Rules \u2014 Well, maybe you\u2019re a little uncomfortable about this, so maybe this can help you make your mind.<br/>Ajax, outraged \u2014 Out! Out! And never set a foot in this story again!<br/></code><br/><br/>Rewards are also a so permanent way of doing things: every time a reward is awarded (or missed) the system reminds us of how it should be played. I don\u2019t like being so brutally and constantly reminded of how I should play. I have the feeling (but no experience, so I may be completely mistaken) that games that include this kind of rewards favor one style of play only. I prefer games to offer the players a larger gamut of experiences to choose from.<br/><br/>Rewards can introduce discrimination amongst the players: those who can get the rewards and those who can\u2019t. (Oh, and those who don\u2019t care or don\u2019t want any reward, count me in that category). They can establish a kind of competition. I don\u2019t like discrimination nor competition (the real, aggressive one) very much in general, maybe that\u2019s why I can\u2019t see any benefit with introducing that in-game.<br/><br/>At the most fundamental level, every game already has inbuilt positive reinforcement in the pleasure derived from the game and from the social approval from the gaming group. These are, imo, the best rewards. And they\u2019re also inbuilt penalty. Don\u2019t play \u201cwell\u201d? you\u2019ll have no fun. Spoil the game for others? significantly? you'll get peer pressure.<br/><br/>Adding mechanical rewards to these essential rewards is (imo, as always) like adding a consolation prize: if you don\u2019t enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played, you get the reward instead of real fun.<br/><br/>The reward does not stack well with the \u201cessential rewards\u201d because there is this style-of-play issue. Mostly, we\u2019re in a narr/story-game situation and want to favor this narr/story-approach by giving a gamist prize: a game advantage that has no direct relation to story nor setting. Try as I want, I can\u2019t imagine anything else than this configuration. Do other combinations exist?<br/><br/>So, <b>DevP</b>, maybe I just have a problem with rewards and currency in general. I believe it <i>is</i> part of the problem, but that maybe there is something still to discover that is a better way to solve the issues that rewards tackle.<br/><br/><b>Thunder_God:</b> If there is a desired story-form, why not just state it and try to follow it. It\u2019s the way to the success of the game, which is every player\u2019s goal. (Dysfunctional gaming groups aside.)<br/><br/><b>ptevis:</b> I don\u2019t know BW directly (still trying to decide what I should buy: BW, BW revised or BE, or another SG, and if the shipping price to and taxes for Europe are worth it) so I have no sure knowledge about Artha. But I believe that players will (make their characters / the story) do cool stuff anyway, if that\u2019s what they\u2019re playing for.<br/><br/>Fan mail: why not directly tell the player \u201cThat was awesome. Do more of that.\u201d? I do, as a player and as a GM and it works. I used to do a \u201cwhat was awesome this time?\u201d recap at the end of a session. But some were embarrassed with this kind of mandatory group hug thing. So I switched (first as a player, not GM) to direct feedback, and most followed. We acclaim and praise each other when something awesome is done (and boo and hiss for exaggerated lameness).<br/><br/>Don\u2019t believe I don\u2019t see any positive effect in rewards in narr/story-games. I\u2019ll list what virtues I attribute them:\n<ul><li>Might tempt a player to try something he thinks he doesn\u2019t like.</li>\n<li>Might be a little funnier as a game in game. (It is not for me, I feel it diverts energy from the main game.)</li>\n<li>Is a perpetual reminder of how to play the game, and hence fight inaction / inertia / game\u2019s bogging down and anchor the play solidly in one style.</li></ul>\nThis last point, which I find is the worthiest, has a downside: it is an obstacle to gameplay-evolution, as you\u2019ll need to house-rule it away or actively alter it. You can try something else consciously, but you can\u2019t progressively drift to another playing-style-optimum nor to your own version. It\u2019s a garment with a built-in cloth-hanger. I find that uncomfortable.<br/><br/><b>Jesse</b>, as you can tell from the preceding, I still read these mechanics as rewards and incentive. It\u2019s like these figure-reversal optical illusions: I can agree briefly with what you see and then bam! I revert to my point of view.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t find that these mechanics make the desired behavior easy nor enjoyable. I already wrote too much about the enjoyable aspect. However, I totally missed the make easy aspect, probably because I can\u2019t remember nor imagine any such mechanic. I feel this facilitator aspect would be very much more satisfying to me, and hence I am very interested. Could you give some examples or point to where I could find them?<br/><br/><b>Rob</b>, about compensations for suboptimal tactics, I feel that if what you want is playing the story, the setting or the characters, this is not a problem. If the story is good, that is the reward. If you make an exceptional sacrifice, maybe a compensation is in order, but I prefer to have a in-story tailored compensation that a mechanical one. I prefer to have real and coherent consequences to the character\u2019s actions.<br/><br/>It is very interesting that you have a reaction to rewards that is totally opposite to mine and that you don\u2019t appreciate character-immersion, which I am very fond of. Could these traits be correlated?<br/><br/> I totally agree that a great part of this thread is about personal preferences that have no or few objective basis. I really like to know how other people feel about this. There probably are objective justifications to the rewards mechanics and we are hunting them. We\u2019ll also be able to determine the subjective part which will allow to design games for one preference, for the other, or for some genius to reconcile us in a single game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135157/#Comment_135157" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T05:07:51+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  5:07AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Josh</b>, about my perception of <b>DevP</b>\u2019s reward example: it is not a matter of not modifying the character as a fictional entity nor of its character sheet. It is because it is a rule that is strictly in-fiction: the character does something and reaps a benefit. What bothers me is rewarding either the character or the player for something the player does. Of course it\u2019s the players that dictate the characters\u2019 actions, so the line can be very blurred. But \u201cactivating one\u2019s fault\u201d is something that is very in-fiction (eg a character goes into the mouth of danger because she\u2019s so curious). To take another example, I would be very bothered if in a novel a character could suddenly achieve more then he should because the writer used a richer vocabulary in that paragraph.<br/><br/>Rewarding the player for a player action or behavior disconcert me less. I wonder if there isn\u2019t a further distinction to be made (if it isn\u2019t already) in playing types / styles / tastes. I\u2019d say I am a story-, setting- or character-simulationist. That is I attach a great importance to story, setting and character coherence; incoherencies in these matters quickly ruin my satisfaction. Maybe the rewards systems are more story-gamist? Having an enjoyable mechanic to build stories, whereby I want to make enjoyable stories and the mechanic should not to get in the way.<br/><br/><br/><b>Mike</b>, I really don\u2019t want to sound condescending and I don\u2019t feel that way. Maybe I was a little too much provocative? I am sorry if I was.<br/><br/>In my own semantic, character progression isn\u2019t a reward of the player if it is setting/genre-coherent. It is only a consequence of the character\u2019s actions. It becomes a reward if the progression is disproportionate with the actions because of the player\u2019s actions.<br/><br/>Could you expand the \u201cAjax\u2019s game has rewards\u201d? Maybe I missed something there.<br/><br/>My games have rewards in the form of the fun they generate. That\u2019s for sure. I am uncomfortable with the rewards mechanics (get points for these, spent them like this) I added on them.<br/><br/>Gosh, I think I just got something there. I can\u2019t help but feel the rewards are <i>external</i> to the games, as foreign tissues.  Maybe that\u2019s the root of my problem. What do you think?<br/><br/>However,\n<blockquote>We find that the feedback cycle that incentivizes players to do certain things that we enjoy in play, does that well. That is, indeed, we just want players to have fun by playing the game in a way that's fun.</blockquote>The problem I have is that I don\u2019t find the incentive / feedback circle to be fun in itself. The game is fun, probably funnier if played in the official way. Nothing prevents me from playing it that way without the incentive. However, the designer feels the need to add an incentive that, for me, diminish the fun and is vaguely insulting (doesn\u2019t trust me to play it well enough without being constantly reminded).\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>You are correct in one thing, for sure... these games are all a reaction to RPGs that promote gamism. But they don't assume that gamism is the norm, or that it has to be combatted. Merely that, as Gamist games promote gamism by being fun to play that way, games that promote other mode will be more fun by promoting those modes. In fact if you read around you may well find that we've gone a long way to talk about this subject and lots of related subject matter. </blockquote>That is my understanding. It is easy to find many numerous and meandering threads on the subject, with no obvious conclusion. Alas, I could not find recapitulative sources to bring my rpg-theory knowledge up-to-date.\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>This also doesn't mean that we've got it perfectly down, either. Our designs are certainly flawed... just like every design is flawed. Some do handle promotion of functional play better than others.</blockquote>Design can of course be flawed. However, I think most are suited to a purpose that might agree a person, or not.<br/><br/><b>Tristan</b>, as I did not have internet access while I was writing this (long) answer, I could not check Troy Costisick reflections.

Freeform being defined as play sans any mechanics. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two "problems" with freeform and design:<br/>\n1. It's already been done. There's nothing new to design here. <br/>\n2. Some people don't find it nearly as interesting (myself for one). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that... if you don't like mechanics that promote story, then there's a great way to create story that relies solely on social rewards (or none at all, other than the fun of play, in some cases). The rules we write are intended for an audience that demands that the rules do something more than say, "Go do it, be nice." That's far from 100% of the audience. In fact, I'd posit that, given some definitions of freeform play (collaborative fanfic, for instance), that TTRPG play is a small minority. TTRPG play where characterization and player-driven plot creation is central, is a minority inside of a minority.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you don't find yourself to be part of our tiny minority... well that's hardly unusual, is it? It may well be that you don't like this sort of game. And no explanation by ourselves for why we like it is going to change your mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's not the same as us saying that we don't like these games. Right? That is, you don't expect that, if you don't like these games, that nobody can. Right? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe condescending part, by the way, comes from comments like saying that you don't feel like you're being treated as an adult by rules like this. The subtext of this comment (intentional or otherwise) is something like, "You people don't trust your players to play well, and so put rules in place to prevent players from misbehaving. You're a fearful bunch." <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully you don't feel this way, really. And you can see that the reason we play with the sorts of mechanics we do is no different than the reasons that people play basketball with foul rules. Because it's a part of the game as designed, and the result is fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reward systems we put in place exist to try to make more of a good thing. To focus play. That is, we expect that players will do these things, even without the rewards. We include them so that an even greater proportion of the activities done in play will be this sort. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause, yes, we are trying to promote one way to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, some people think this is controversial. But, you know what? Any RPG can be played "any way" by anyone playing it. That won't make the rules exceptionally fun for any particular way to play, however. That is, you can play Rolemaster as a player-theme-producing game, in theory. It's just that you'll be wading through the rules in order to get your goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, just like there's no need to design RPGs that do not have mechanics (freeform), there is no reason to design RPGs that can be played in any way. Trying actively to make a RPG that is all things to everyone results in designs that do nothing for anyone. Our design principles say that you should design your RPG to do one sort of play well. Players who like that sort of play, will enjoy the game a lot. THose who do not enjoy that, may not. And, if they want to play it some other way, they can. And they'll likely modify the system to get it to do what they want (JD would tell us that this happens in 100% of cases anyhow). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, further, I'd posit that most people are actually just fine playing many different sorts of RPGs. That is (and I'm obviously biased here), if and when people try these games and accept that they are what they are - which may not be what they are used to - then they tend to enjoy them for what they are. So even if the "target audience" seems really tiny, we really do believe that just about anyone can have fun playing these games. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust as I enjoy playing World of Warcraft. It's in some ways a polar opposite to what I enjoy in TTRPGs. But that difference just means that I have more varieties of the overall RPG activity that I get to enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, what I'm hoping in your case is that your fears are theoretical. That is, as you don't seem to have played these games much, if at all, you seem to be responding in the hypothetical. Like, "If I played this, from what I read in the rules, I think it would grate on me." To which I can only suggest that you actually try it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might turn out that you hate it. Who can say. Preferences vary. But trying to predict your level of enjoyment based solely on a read of a game is likely unreliable. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, if it should turn out that you do hate them... you're not saying we're idiots for liking them.

Burning Wheel/Empires and Primetime Adventures have been used as examples already. Universalis, in my very limited experience, essentially <i>is</i> a reward system. Spirit of the Century's FATE points is another system you may want to check out; it's worked great for my group in the past.<br/><br/>After playing these games with your friends, you may still hold to your original opinion. If you do, I suggest the following: go attend a convention and play with strangers, or recruit some random people through a local forum or something. Play a game that's really open-ended, like GURPS. Then play a game that's really focused, like The Mountain Witch.<br/><br/>Consider the Lumpley Principle: <i>System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play</i>. It may well be that the group you're playing with now already have a very well-established social reward system, and bolting on another is just cumbersome. In that case, I salute you - I often have sessions where I disagree with the direction other players are taking the game in, and where there is no good way for me to resolve that conflict without resorting to game rules.<br/><br/>For me, this is just the reality of gaming with grown-ups. We don't meet often outside of gaming, to build affinity and integrate interests. We come from diverse gaming backgrounds and have very different default modes of play. We can't meet three times a week anymore, so our sessions have to be focused and fun for everyone. And yelling "I hate your stupid barbarian, he always gets us in shit, you suck!" to a 40-year old you see a couple dozen times a year is very different from saying the same thing to a 14-year old peer you'll sit next to in math all next week.<br/><br/>Gaming with an explicit reward system compensates well for these issues, in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135212/#Comment_135212" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T10:43:51+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 10:43AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ajax,\n<blockquote>about compensations for suboptimal tactics, I feel that if what you want is playing the story, the setting or the characters, this is not a problem. If the story is good, that is the reward. </blockquote>\nBy "suboptimal tactics", I primarily mean "tactics that cost you in terms of your ability to influence the story". I think that my enjoyment of "the story" is as much dependent on <i>who creates it</i> as any qualities of the story itself. If I don't create it at all (as a player) or if <i>only</i> I create it (as a GM) I don't enjoy it very much.<br/><br/>Probably my highest, most important goal in roleplaying is <i>collaborative creation of a story</i>. (Either that or <i>collaborative creation of a fantasy world</i>). Secondary goals are to <i>manipulate</i> a world in a pleasing way, to show off my creativity and story-contribution, etc. Roleplaying (acting a character) is fun but is somewhere around the third tier in importance. (As I already noted, <i>being </i> a character isn't something that happens very strongly for me)<br/><br/>Looking at your replies to other people, I think there's bit of a disconnect between us in terms how we perceive gaming. You seem pretty confident that you can achieve the gaming you want without many explicit rules and procedures. I'm not - my experience is of a messy business where groups <i>try</i> to have a good time together but much of the time they struggle because of structural issues (e.g. suboptimal <i>character</i> choices reduce <i>player</i> power) or failure to understand what everybody else is interested in. I have a decent time gaming, but I'm always on the look out for ways to make it better.<br/><br/>Hence my practical interest in reward mechanics.<br/><br/>What Mikael said (about focus becomes important when gaming time is scarce) really rang true for me, too.\n<blockquote>It is very interesting that you have a reaction to rewards that is totally opposite to mine and that you don\u2019t  appreciate character-immersion, which I am very fond of. Could these traits be correlated?</blockquote>\nYeah, I think so, at least in a simple way: if mechanical rewards prevent your attainment of character-immersion (which you value a lot), then you <i>can't</i>  enjoy them, or at least not fully. If mechanical rewards don't interfere with me attaining anything else I value (and I don't think they do), then I <i>can</i> enjoy them (although it's not necessarily true that I <i>will</i>).<br/><br/>To pick up on one other point: you mention that you don't like the feeling that some designer "doesn\u2019t trust me to play it well enough without being constantly reminded". Personally, <b><i>I</i></b> don't trust <b><i>me</i></b> to have an optimal gaming time without constant reminders of various kinds. I don't feel that these reminders are an imposition by the designer. In a broad sense, I feel like the designer's equal... given time and effort, I could derive some useful reminders myself, and probably would (thereby becoming a designer myself). By using a game product that's had a lot of care put into it by someone good, however, I can get much better reminders, for less effort.<br/><br/>Put another way: designers are useful to me exactly insofar as the tell me how to play, and provide a mechanism that leads me to have a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136607/#Comment_136607" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T04:32:15+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  4:32AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 4:34AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bump!

I also want to dissipate any misunderstanding about my point of view that crept in, probably due to difference in gaming experiences, my inexperience here, my low knowledge of story game, rpg theory and specific vocabulary, and my faulty knowledge of English.<br/><br/>The following post is quite long and disjointed but I had days to think about the subject and could not post things in order. I hope it will not bore those who will have the courage to read it too much. Thank you in advance for your patience <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I\u2019ll add example and context from my current concerns and games. You\u2019ll see me oscillate between <b>my/our game</b> as I\u2019ll reference my/our main game, which is a rather trad game/campaign. A long going (more than 15 years) series of campaigns set in the same house setting, with multiple gms and varying players and rules, and which is somehow slowly evolving towards a more story-oriented game. I hesitate between \u201cmy\u201d and \u201cour\u201d because while I am the current main gm, I am not alone mastering the game (same setting, same stories, same characters) and I am not the originator of the setting (but I am the main designer of our current house system which is still far from perfect or even complete).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Addressing the <b>vocabulary</b> differences, it seems that to some of you \u201crewards\u201d \u2013 or maybe only \u201creward-system\u201d? \u2013 has a specific meaning detached from the common one. (I find it a unfortunately common error for a specific group to re-defines a common word for its specific purpose. It inescapably leads to communications problems later on. Eg \u201cfree\u201d in software parlance.) When I write \u201creward\u201d I mean: somebody receive a given advantageous/desirable something as payment for a prescribed behavior/action/achievement. Nothing more. Troy Costisick\u2019s reward definition (on his blog): \u201cAny part of System (usually a specific rules mechanic) that encourages and sustains a particular kind of behavior from the players and/or GM. \xbb is way to large to my tastes as there are many other ways than rewarding the players for encouraging or sustaining a behavior.<br/><br/>Still about vocabulary, I am culprit of misusing the term <i>fun</i>, which obviously led to misunderstanding. I wonder if <i>gratifying</i> would not be a better word. As an example, watching Romeo and Juliet is <i>not fun</i> (nor, probably, would be roleplaying it). But it is gratifying. <br/><br/><br/><br/>While I can sometime <b>immerse deeply</b> in a character, and enjoy it, I never experienced an immersion so deep that I had not another level of conscience enjoying the character\u2019s sufferance, either in term of gratification (failure / pain that leads to growing, evolution) or in term of story. In most stories (games), most of the time, the characters are in trouble, danger and generally really uncomfortable situations. Deep immersion as pure identification, first-person-perspective only\u2026 I can\u2019t see how that might be enjoyable. Immersion can be gratifying for the other perspective it offers, or for the fact of being able to \u201cexperience\u201d someone else, but that\u2019s what I mean by another level of conscience, a part of the player that watches the player being the character so that the player can enjoy the suffering he experiences through the character.<br/><br/>So a game can be both not-fun and gratifying, whether deeply immersed or not. It\u2019s the gratification that\u2019s important, not the fun nor the immersion although they can be the means.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Back to <b>rewards</b>: I certainly have problems with some of them.<br/><br/>As I don\u2019t like at all being rewarded for my behavior, especially when it feels like a reinforcement system, I don\u2019t appreciate when the players are rewarded. It is subjective, it is personal and maybe it isn\u2019t a common reaction, but I don\u2019t think I am unique. I therefore consider that this is a data for game design.<br/><br/>I do not like much when the player / character separation is crossed or blurred. I do not like much when the character is rewarded, I prefer what happens in the shared fiction to be coherent and self-contained.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I understand and accept compensations for making really disadvantageous choices, even to the point of being setting/genre incoherent. But I do not know of any mechanics that is supple and adaptive enough to cater for differing player expectations / goals / values. In tightly focused games, the game-designer can limit the rewards to game goals / values, which should set the player expectations for the game. I would like a compensation mechanic that frame but does not restrict the richness of the player negotiation / gm\u2019s surprise \u201cfreeform\u201d solution.<br/><br/>Rewards / compensations for unfavorable choices become less and less relevant as all players accept the gratification value of failure and sufferance. Also, I fear systematic compensation, or maybe over-compensation, for unfavorable choices will lead to a game were failure will be the norm and to emo-characters, which I do not desire for any long term game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Troy Cosistick</b>\u2019s <i>If it\u2019s already fun without rewards, it will be funnier still with them.</i><br/><br/>I do not agree.  It\u2019s like saying that if a dish is good, it will be better with chili peppers. That is true only if you like chili peppers and if the dish is appropriate. A game is funnier with rewards only for those that like rewards and if the game is appropriate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136608/#Comment_136608" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T04:35:09+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  4:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some <b>reward-like</b> mechanic that I enjoy. (Maybe you\u2019ll think they\u2019re really rewards and I just don\u2019t call them that because I do like them and say I don\u2019t like rewards. Please do tell me if you think the differences I sport are meaningless for you.)<br/><br/><b>Key-experience</b> is one of them. But are keys really story-oriented? Surely, they promote a kind of story/game where a focus is on character exploration. I find keys sufficiently setting-coherent, as I can think of them as consequences rather than rewards and they don\u2019t cross the player/character separation.<br/><br/>Another example, from the French game <i>Nighprowler</i> (that is the French title, the game hasn\u2019t been translated.) The characters are thieves in a dark medieval-fantastic setting. It\u2019s a rather trad game. However here is one neat little mechanic, reward-like, that promote the game\u2019s genre.\n<blockquote><b>Sellout</b><br/>A starting character begins with 2 Sellout points. A character can go up to 5.<br/>A character gains a Sellout point by using one of the following three possibilities. All actions done in this way must have a goal that is egoistic, nasty or detrimental for others. You can\u2019t Sellout to help anybody, friend or foe, except yourself.<br/><b>\u201cFortune smiles to the wicked\u201d</b> The player can alter a gm\u2019s description to favor his character. Every use highlights the character\u2019s luck and is generally disastrous for others.<br/><b>\u201cVermin insinuates in everywhere\u201d</b> One of the villainous contacts of the character intervenes at the right time, even if they shouldn\u2019t be there now.<br/><b>\u201cAgainst all the odds\u201d</b> The character uses of the most villainous, most treacherous, dirtiest, but visibly effective,  techniques to augment his action\u2019s quality by one notch.<br/><b>\u201cThere is a price\u201d</b><br/>The number of Sellout a character has influences his image. Others will find him less trustful, less reliable, more corrupt. The character is penalized of his Sellout score on any social interaction test based on trust, reputation, respect or credibility.<br/>When a character reaches 5 Sellout points, he cannot Sellout anymore. And he will suffer a severe backlash, at the gm\u2019s hand. It can be a severe Sellout negatively affecting the character or an opportunity for the GM to make the character pay for his evil acts. This will erase every Sellout point the character has.</blockquote>\nI find this mechanic simple and to the point. It isn\u2019t perfect, but it promotes the genre and is purely in-world. And if it is a short term \u201creward\u201d, there is a long-term price to pay.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>Dissociaton of the player's interests from the character's interests, making the player the author of the character, and not responsible for his failures, is the primary shift between other forms and narrativism promoting games. As an example, in Universalis, we award the player Coins for creating "complications" that may end up hurting the characters that we ourselves made earlier in the scene. The player is rewarded for creating drama, instead of being rewarded for character success. And drama requires occasional failure.</blockquote> I share these goals.<br/><br/>Actually, I believe I will still incorporate rewards in my game/campaign (a rather trad game with a very wide focus and a nascent story orientation). While they grate on my sensibilities, they might serve their purpose well and encourage the other players toward a more story oriented playing style. If they work and I can tolerate them, I\u2019ll keep them. However I have trouble using them. I don\u2019t like to reward the character for the player attitude as it is setting-jarring and will surely lead to unwanted inequalities between the characters (I am almost sure some players will never earn a reward). I don\u2019t know how to reward the players themselves in such a game. And I don\u2019t want to create a feedback mechanism that will lead seduced players farther and farther into a story-game while leaving the rest uninterested. That might lead to a group split, which I do not want. I still do not like rewards but, for the time being, they\u2019re the lesser evil.\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite> But in the games we write, we usually stay away from rewarding the character, and instead reward the player (in fact the detractors of our style of play often say that this dissociation is the most problematic part of play). This is how you can get systems where it's fun to have your character fail. Which is the sole key to most of these games. </blockquote> Of course it can be gratifying to have the character fail. Most roleplayer (and other story-lovers: film-watchers, readers, \u2026) are already at least halfway there: the character generally must be in trouble for the story to be enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136610/#Comment_136610" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T04:35:39+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  4:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The race\u2019s winner\u2019s cup example</b><br/>The cup isn\u2019t a reward in the same sense as the rewards I try to discuss here, because it does not affect the race (much).

Suddenly, there's no incentive to actually try to win. Everyone stays on the starting line.</blockquote>Is this a real example / experience? I have an analogous experience to share, with a differing conclusion.<br/><br/>Some years ago, in my main gaming group, we had a period of playing Tekken (I don\u2019t remember which one, probably Tekken II or III) on the Playstation and spent some night fighting each other in that game. I was not the best, by far, as the game owner and his close friends had played and trained for a long time, but neither was I the worst.<br/><br/>For those who don\u2019t know this electronic game: two players each choose a fighter who fight in an arena. Knowing each fighter\u2019s abilities and knowing the button combinations, rhythms, and conditions needed to activate them is essential, with good reflexes and execution speed. The fighters fight and one wins the game by beating the others two successive rounds or two of three rounds.<br/><br/>The play tradition was, as in many gaming groups, that the winner kept the controller and the looser left their place for another player. <br/><br/>The \u201cright to continue playing\u201d was the rule that organized the players, but it was also a reward as continuing to play was desired and depended on the player\u2019s behavior (and abilities).<br/><br/>My brother and I challenged that rule, because it favored the more experienced players and lead to real opposition that bordered on unfriendliness. Those who already had the most experience, that is who already had the opportunity to play the game the most, continued playing the game while those who hadn\u2019t were excluded after really short and humiliating rounds. The system was unjust, maintained and reinforced the difference between the players and that diminished the gaming pleasure.<br/><br/>We changed the rule to this one: the looser kept playing until he either won, or lost three times in a row (then both players changed). Following this modification, the ambiance quickly changed. Firstly, the worst players were able to gradually learn the game, which led to better games for everybody. The better players quitted the \u201cfighting to win at all cost and without risk\u201d attitude, as it kept them from playing, as the worst were previously kept from playing by their powerlessness. The better players switched their focus to \u201ctry to play a little longer\u201d and quickly to \u201ctry to have enjoyable matches\u201d. They started taking risks (choosing a fighter that was intrinsically less powerful, or weak against this particular opponent, or that they did not know as well to teaching the others; trying to achieve difficult but not so powerful combos; trying to learn a new difficult trick while playing; giving their opponent a chance), teaching the others. The less-abled players kept trying to win most of the time, even if it meant loosing their immediate right to continue playing. The gaming pleasure was enhanced for everybody.<br/><br/>So, rewarding the loosers surely changed the nature of the game but did not destroyed the game. Most people were not fundamentally playing to win, nor to be rewarded, but to play. The \u201cto win\u201d part was how you played. Most people assumed that rewarding the winner was what would generate the best play experience but, to my tastes and for my group, it was wrong.<br/><br/>So here is an example of a reward I like. It rewards the player for the player behavior, it generates and sustains a desirable behavior and it is central to the system: it was not added as an afterthought or as another part and you can\u2019t remove it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136612/#Comment_136612" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T04:36:05+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  4:36AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 4:45AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Mike</b>, a parenthesis about freeform: I do not believe that freeform is ruleless, although most of the rules are generally tacit.

There are other ways of promoting story than these rewards and than rewards in general. I wonder if they're better or worse.\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>TRPG play where characterization and player-driven plot creation is central, is a minority inside of a minority. So if you don't find yourself to be part of our tiny minority... well that's hardly unusual, is it? It may well be that you don't like this sort of game. And no explanation by ourselves for why we like it is going to change your mind.<br/><br/>But that's not the same as us saying that we don't like these games. Right? That is, you don't expect that, if you don't like these games, that nobody can. Right?</blockquote> Perhaps I am not part of your minority, but then I must be very near it. As I have no real experience with strongly focused  story-game, I try to understand what I can on the intartubes. I think I would like some of these games. I don\u2019t try to convince anyone that they\u2019re wrong in their taste. I am not even saying so. But I believe that by sharing our differing perception we might learn.\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>The condescending part, by the way, comes from comments like saying that you don't feel like you're being treated as an adult by rules like this. The subtext of this comment (intentional or otherwise) is something like, "You people don't trust your players to play well, and so put rules in place to prevent players from misbehaving. You're a fearful bunch."<br/><br/>Hopefully you don't feel this way, really. </blockquote>No, not at all. I don\u2019t know where that subtext comes from, but surely not from me. I wrote that I would feel as if I was not trusted, but I know that is not the case, nor the point. Feelings vs. rationality. By the way, I don\u2019t believe any rule can prevent a player to misbehave and I think you do not either.\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>And you can see that the reason we play with the sorts of mechanics we do is no different than the reasons that people play basketball with foul rules. Because it's a part of the game as designed, and the result is fun.<br/><br/>The reward systems we put in place exist to try to make more of a good thing. To focus play. them so that an even greater proportion of the activities done in play will be this sort. <br/><br/>Because, yes, we are trying to promote one way to play. <br/><br/>Yeah, some people think this is controversial. But, you know what? Any RPG can be played "any way" by anyone playing it. That won't make the rules exceptionally fun for any particular way to play, however. That is, you can play Rolemaster as a player-theme-producing game, in theory. It's just that you'll be wading through the rules in order to get your goal. <br/><br/>In other words, just like there's no need to design RPGs that do not have mechanics (freeform), there is no reason to design RPGs that can be played in any way. Trying actively to make a RPG that is all things to everyone results in designs that do nothing for anyone. Our design principles say that you should design your RPG to do one sort of play well. Players who like that sort of play, will enjoy the game a lot. THose who do not enjoy that, may not. And, if they want to play it some other way, they can. And they'll likely modify the system to get it to do what they want (JD would tell us that this happens in 100% of cases anyhow). </blockquote>I follow you 100%. I am not attacking the narr-/story-game idea(l). Just saying rewards don\u2019t agree easily with me.\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>And, again, what I'm hoping in your case is that your fears are theoretical. That is, as you don't seem to have played these games much, if at all, you seem to be responding in the hypothetical. Like, "If I played this, from what I read in the rules, I think it would grate on me." To which I can only suggest that you actually try it. <br/><br/>It might turn out that you hate it. Who can say. Preferences vary. But trying to predict your level of enjoyment based solely on a read of a game is likely unreliable. </blockquote>I do not now actively plan to play any story-game but I will jump on the opportunity to, should it present itself. What I am doing is trying to learn as much as I can to improve my play.<br/><br/>Seduced, I have added rewards to my play and found them jarring. So I am researching. Maybe I misunderstood something? Maybe it is just me? Maybe there is a genre clash?\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite>And, again, if it should turn out that you do hate them... you're not saying we're idiots for liking them. Right? Or fearful? Or anything negative, right? You'd just be saying that it's not your cup of tea?<br/><br/>Then there's no controversy at all.</blockquote>There is no controversy. I was interested in your opinion, and never meant to attack anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136613/#Comment_136613" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T04:45:28+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  4:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Iachek</cite>Ajax, it sounds to me like this boils down to an assumption on your part that it's good for a game to be flexible in terms of what stories you can tell with it, while I think the majority of self-professed "story gamers" believe the opposite. </blockquote>Spot on!\n<blockquote><cite>Iachek</cite>It may not be apparent to you why some hold to that idea until you try a game with a really, really good reward system. Burning Wheel/Empires and Primetime Adventures have been used as examples already. Universalis, in my very limited experience, essentially is a reward system. Spirit of the Century's FATE points is another system you may want to check out; it's worked great for my group in the past. </blockquote>I\u2019ll check them if I can. What is the difference, if any, between Burning Wheel and Burning Empires?\n<blockquote><cite>Iachek</cite>After playing these games with your friends, you may still hold to your original opinion. If you do, I suggest the following: go attend a convention and play with strangers, or recruit some random people through a local forum or something. Play a game that's really open-ended, like GURPS. Then play a game that's really focused, like The Mountain Witch. </blockquote>If I had the time and resources, I would. With a demanding job, a definitively-non-gaming-wife, a 14 month old son and the renovation works of an old house, (all in all, nothing unusual, I know) my time for gaming is really short and I tend to reserve it to play with my friends.<br/><br/>Also, I never have seen nor heard of a story or Indie game down here.\n<blockquote><cite>Iachek</cite>Consider the Lumpley Principle: System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play. It may well be that the group you're playing with now already have a very well-established social reward system, and bolting on another is just cumbersome. In that case, I salute you - I often have sessions where I disagree with the direction other players are taking the game in, and where there is no good way for me to resolve that conflict without resorting to game rules. </blockquote>I will not say there is no disagreement, but these are usually solved by doing a meta-session. Sometime it involved parting ways with some players when the gaming expectations were irreconcilable (most of the time we keep in touch because we appreciate each other, even if our gaming tastes don\u2019t agree). I believe rules could have preempted the problem by defining more precisely what expectations could have been fulfilled, but that if the expectations were irreconcilable we could not have brought them together through rules. (The most representative cases were a strategist-gamist not interested in story, nor setting, nor characters; a spotlight hog that would deem any time not spent on him as boring; a nutty who mouth-fed his cats during play and could not think of character rivalry, treason or dishonesty as anything other than real player/friend treachery; an egoistical who could not bring herself to believe that the setting was different in essence from the Carebears.)\n<blockquote><cite>Iachek</cite>For me, this is just the reality of gaming with grown-ups. We don't meet often outside of gaming, to build affinity and integrate interests. We come from diverse gaming backgrounds and have very different default modes of play. We can't meet three times a week anymore, so our sessions have to be focused and fun for everyone. And yelling "I hate your stupid barbarian, he always gets us in shit, you suck!" to a 40-year old you see a couple dozen times a year is very different from saying the same thing to a 14-year old peer you'll sit next to in math all next week. </blockquote>No problem for that here, although I would choose other words to explain the problem to the player. We meet once a month, our sessions are generally intense and gratifying, except when we are all too tired to play well.\n<blockquote><cite>Iachek</cite>Gaming with an explicit reward system compensates well for these issues, in my experience. </blockquote> I don\u2019t deny it can, but I don\u2019t think rules can change much to players\u2019 preferences and expectations. I believe it can spell what the player can expect from the game, thus alleviating misunderstandings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136616/#Comment_136616" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T05:16:05+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  5:16AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Rob Alexander</cite>By "suboptimal tactics", I primarily mean "tactics that cost you in terms of your ability to influence the story". I think that my enjoyment of "the story" is as much dependent on who creates it as any qualities of the story itself. If I don't create it at all (as a player) or if only I create it (as a GM) I don't enjoy it very much. </blockquote> I feel like that myself. As I only discovered story-games recently, I am used to providing my gms with ever-developing character background to add story hooks and details to the character and setting. That was the way I found to solve the problem of the gm/player divide and of story-control. I also offered to co-gm while keeping some \u201cpersonal\u201d characters, with varying success. Story-games show me better ways of getting nearer to my tastes.<br/><br/>Actions that costs you in term of story-influence\u2026 does this problem occur as much in story-games as in more trad games?<br/><br/>Compensations/rewards for actions that penalize the player\u2019s ability/right to play is a very interesting concept. However, I have difficulties imagining how do to that in practice. The way we solved this in our game is simply allowing players to play any NPC when their PC is neutralized, and proposing characters for the less active players.\n<blockquote><cite>Rob Alexander</cite>Probably my highest, most important goal in roleplaying is collaborative creation of a story. (Either that or collaborative creation of a fantasy world). Secondary goals are to manipulate a world in a pleasing way, to show off my creativity and story-contribution, etc. Roleplaying (acting a character) is fun but is somewhere around the third tier in importance. (As I already noted, being a character isn't something that happens very strongly for me) </blockquote> I can enjoy all these with no definite preference.\n<blockquote><cite>Rob Alexander</cite>Looking at your replies to other people, I think there's bit of a disconnect between us in terms how we perceive gaming. You seem pretty confident that you can achieve the gaming you want without many explicit rules and procedures. I'm not - my experience is of a messy business where groups try to have a good time together but much of the time they struggle because of structural issues (e.g. suboptimal character choices reduce player power) or failure to understand what everybody else is interested in. I have a decent time gaming, but I'm always on the look out for ways to make it better. </blockquote> We have a body of implicit rules that evolved naturally. We usually add new players one or two at a time as we meet them and they manifest their interest. This allow the rules to remain implicit as they are gradually learned. We have procedures, also implicit. But the only static and really explicit rule is \u201cif something is wrong, if there is something you don\u2019t like or would like better, we\u2019ll discuss it\u201d. So far it allowed us to solve every problem. We also present the game to new players specifically stating what kind of game it is, what they\u2019ll find and what they will not.\n<blockquote><cite>Rob Alexander</cite>Hence my practical interest in reward mechanics.</blockquote> And mine also.\n<blockquote><cite>Rob Alexander</cite>What Mikael said (about focus becomes important when gaming time is scarce) really rang true for me, too.</blockquote>Yes. But imo it isn\u2019t necessary to reduce the gamut of stories you can play to focus a game. It is a way and it certainly is easier to design good rules to favor one type of stories to the exclusion of others. I want to focus on having good, dense, intense games but I do not want to reduce my story range.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Rob Alexander</cite><cite>Ajax Aldwyne</cite>It is very interesting that you have a reaction to rewards that is totally opposite to mine and that you don\u2019t appreciate character-immersion, which I am very fond of. Could these traits be correlated?</blockquote>Yeah, I think so, at least in a simple way: if mechanical rewards prevent your attainment of character-immersion (which you value a lot), then you can't enjoy them, or at least not fully. If mechanical rewards don't interfere with me attaining anything else I value (and I don't think they do), then I can enjoy them (although it's not necessarily true that I will). I value character immersion, but not more than, eg, story development. And rewards don\u2019t really affect my character immersion (although they rub me the wrong way when they conflict with how I feel the character should conduct themself). My irritation with rewards is more general.\n<blockquote><cite>Rob Alexander</cite>To pick up on one other point: you mention that you don't like the feeling that some designer "doesn\u2019t trust me to play it well enough without being constantly reminded". Personally, I don't trust me to have an optimal gaming time without constant reminders of various kinds. I don't feel that these reminders are an imposition by the designer. In a broad sense, I feel like the designer's equal... given time and effort, I could derive some useful reminders myself, and probably would (thereby becoming a designer myself). By using a game product that's had a lot of care put into it by someone good, however, I can get much better reminders, for less effort. Put another way: designers are useful to me exactly insofar as the tell me how to play, and provide a mechanism that leads me to have a good time. </blockquote>I agree, it\u2019s just that right now I prefer other forms of reminder. The most forceful would be to simply regulate what the players must do. Rewards are more supple and subtle and have the advantage of still being in-game, while meta-game discussion/management is more disruptive but even suppler. Are there other ways?<br/><br/>Whew !

This enhances the forward momentum of the game already.<br/><br/>In chess, manipulating the ways you can put the king into check reduces your opponent's move options, which rewards you by making an outcome easier to predict.  Another example is the point value given to pieces. Giving up a piece to the opponent can reward you because it puts their piece in a specific location that you predict ahead of time. Since pawns are less valuable than knights, then by sacrificing a pawn in order to take a knight rewards you in the long term game.<br/><br/>Games are driven by rewards. Without rewards, there's no reason to play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>So, rewarding the loosers surely changed the nature of the game but did not destroyed the game. Most people were not fundamentally playing to win, nor to be rewarded, but to play. The \u201cto win\u201d part was how you played. Most people assumed that rewarding the winner was what would generate the best play experience but, to my tastes and for my group, it was wrong.<br/><br/>So here is an example of a reward I like. It rewards the player for the player behavior, it generates and sustains a desirable behavior and it is central to the system: it was not added as an afterthought or as another part and you can\u2019t remove it.</blockquote>\nBut you can remove it and it was added as an afterthought and is not at all central. The PlayStation and Tekken's game design was central. Needing two or more people to play was central. But who played and in what order wasn't central.  You tried playing one way, and then changed it. If you stuck with the old way, it would have continued to be less enjoyable. So you see, the rules weren't static or central, but in terms of your enjoyment and having a cohesively fun experience, those rules were core.  This is how rewards work in the better story games. It gets put in, play tested, and tweaked until the desired results. Whether that's to "reward the winner" or "give the losers a chance to improve" is up to the designer. But they end up being central in the game through proven and consistent fun by lots of people.<br/><br/>But rewards are always towards the player and in many games, they are a result of player behavior. Even ones that go to the character, like experience, are more for the player to increase their character's abilities. In Dogs in the Vineyard, you get rewarded for facing odds that cause you to fail. Spirit of the Century rewards you for putting your character into specific situations that you define as an important part of your character. HeroQuest rewards you for pursuing actions that your character excels at. Shadow of Yesterday rewards you for pursuing built in character aspects or permanently changing them. These are not added in as an afterthough, and can't be removed without a significant reduction in at least the fun, and more often the core function of the game itself.<br/><br/>So after all this, and especially after your Tekken example, where you clearly saw the rules improve the game, I don't see how you are generally irritated with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136712/#Comment_136712" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T14:25:17+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  2:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting you mention Chess and Checkers ...

There is something in this thread, but I still can\u2019t bring it out. It\u2019s infuriating. Either I am totally unable to express myself, to understand myself, or to understand the story mindset (although I thought I was close to it). Obviously I separate rewards in several categories, and I feel there should be an objective criterion, but I still can\u2019t understand it.<br/><br/>You are perfectly right: you can take the reward out of the Tekken example, although I had a hard time seeing that. I thought you had to decide who was going to play (right so far) and that you <i>had to</i> base that decision on the players behavior/achievements. How dumb was I? So it <i>is</i> a reward. Player rewarded for player behavior/achievement. Why does it not make me feel like I am herded? Is it only because I agree with the goal / the prescribed behavior? I\u2019d like to think there is another reason.<br/><br/>I can get the checkers example. However, till now I saw the crowning of pawn as a \u201cin-setting\u201d, \u201cphysical\u201d rule, and still see it mostly that way. In that (my) mindset, it\u2019s like saying that growing / a long life is the reward for having a healthful diet. To me it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a consequence. Now, from a design perspective, it is obviously a reward <i>if</i> you want to promote the forward momentum of the game. So the intention behind the design is important to me. I am not sure if it is effectively the goal/origin of this rule, but I don\u2019t like this kind of game (that includes chess), so I don\u2019t know them past the bare basics. I always thought their rules more as \u201cevolved\u201d than as \u201cdesigned\u201d, which renders the intention analysis awkward.<br/><br/>Now I can\u2019t agree with the chess example. To me, the check rule is a simple consequence of the goal of the game: detain the king, don\u2019t eliminate him. Using the check rule is like forcing an opponent backwards in a sword fight by using the menace of what you could do to him with your sword if he doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s not a reward, that\u2019s a tactic / strategy toward the goal. The same goes for the sacrifice, or other tactics you haven\u2019t mentioned (pins, \u2026). They ensue from the knowledge and exploitation of the physical rules of the setting \u2013 moves and capture \u2013 to reach the goal.<br/><br/>Games are driven by reward, ok. Games are rewarding, that is to say gratifying, fun. Or we wouldn\u2019t play them. But I can\u2019t see any in-game reward in chess, and I don\u2019t believe in-game rewards are a necessity. They\u2019re a tool, a useful one, but not a necessity.<br/><br/>As you can see, my perception of rewards is evolving, maturing, thanks to your efforts. My excuse to all those who probably tried to tell me the same things from the start, I have a hard time integrating this and your hard work most probably participate in my progression, even if it becomes visible only now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136812/#Comment_136812" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-28T11:21:53+00:00" title="March 28, 2008 11:21AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Rewards like the ones you describe make sense in a win / lose framework, but do they in RPGs?</blockquote>\nLike the ones I describe? Maybe, maybe not. The closest example I can think of off the top of my head is Grey Ranks. There, in order to succeed in later missions, you need large dice, but your resources to get them are limited. So if you make hard choices early on, stick to smaller dice and possibly screw your fellow players in a mission, then later on you'll have a better chance at success.  This is similar to both games. Going for the crown often is at the cost of not taking a capture opportunity or leaving some other piece vulnerable to capture. That's the risk. The reward is having doubled manueverability.<br/><br/>So, in a general sense, risk vs reward happens all the time.  Although there's not always a broader sense of winning the whole game, there's a macrocosm of many events. Win against this monster. Get victory in this roll to climb a cliff. Losing this arguement because something good will result (whether it's mechanical or personal satisfaction).  But the build up is a lot longer. Maybe going back to when you made the character with a good climb ability, that was at the cost of giving him a good singing ability, or whatever. But it might also be more immediate at the same time, because you have a better climb ability than singing, you pushed your agenda down a path that would let you use climb to succeed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>Player rewarded for player behavior/achievement.

I\u2019d like to think there is another reason.</blockquote>\nMaybe it's because you didn't see it as a reward?  Or maybe it's more than just agreement, but that it improved the experience, so you didn't feel herded. I'm sure cows don't care for being forced into small indoor spaces, but letting them loose on an open field is still herding.  Perhaps the rewards you have a problem with are ones that work against what you enjoy in a game, and there are several in your experiences that just float on by. <br/><br/>You're right, the classic games are more evolved (like Castling in Chess is only a few hundred years old) than intentional but, well, there's a big difference in entertainment before the days where copyright came onto the scene. And reward is still a part of it, heck it's a part of life in general. This caveman was smart enough to biuld a better spear, so he's rewarded by not starving to death next winter. But back to games, you can look at Monopoly, Life, Sorry, any classic board game for clear examples of reward (as well as more current stuff). <br/><br/>I think your Tekken example is a good one particularly for story games because it reflects what many story games try to do, in terms of rewards. Rewards used to offset disappointment. So, when you lose a match, that's disappointment, but you get to play again for it unless it's your third loss in a row. If you win, that's satisfying, and rewarding in a non-mechanical way, but the cost is you have to pass the controller to someone else. A lot of story games entice players to get into conflict or difficult situations by using the mechanics. Perhaps we should explore those for what rewards might exist that don't jump out at you. What RPGs or board games do you enjoy and can you find some ways that they might reward you mechanically?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136817/#Comment_136817" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-28T11:49:07+00:00" title="March 28, 2008 11:49AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2008 11:50AM by Thor_O.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Interesting you mention Chess and Checkers ...

But I guess it depends on your type of play. To take the fight against the monster example, the player who decide there is a monster to defeat <i>might</i> place a reward. In classic D&amp;D style, most of the time the monster has a treasure that no in-setting reason nor meta-setting story reason justify. It is a bonus for defeating the monster and I probably would consider it a reward. The treasure doesn\u2019t even need to exist: the probability that there is a treasure, through hope, is an incentive and a reward in itself. Now, if the monster is there for a story or an exploration reason, there probably is no reward.<br/><br/>Reward, to me and in this conversation, demands that there is intent of enticing the players to a given behavior. Gain is a consequence. Foreknown gain is announced consequence. Reward is a foreknown gain placed there with a motive (other than coherence).\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite>But the build up is a lot longer. Maybe going back to when you made the character with a good climb ability, that was at the cost of giving him a good singing ability, or whatever. But it might also be more immediate at the same time, because you have a better climb ability than singing, you pushed your agenda down a path that would let you use climb to succeed. </blockquote>To me that\u2019s investment and speculation. Character building optimization.\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>Player rewarded for player behavior/achievement. Why does it not make me feel like I am herded? Is it only because I agree with the goal / the prescribed behavior? I\u2019d like to think there is another reason.</blockquote>Maybe it's because you didn't see it as a reward?  Or maybe it's more than just agreement, but that it improved the experience, so you didn't feel herded. Undoublty, <i>what</i> is rewarded is as important to me and I don\u2019t know if there is an objective principle there. I hope so, but I still need time to ponder this puzzle. Now, <i>how</i> is important also: what is the reward, how is it given. The rewards I appreciate seem to be deeply embedded in the system and those I dislike are rather superficial.\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite>I'm sure cows don't care for being forced into small indoor spaces, but letting them loose on an open field is still herding. </blockquote>Thank you for the nice analogy <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite>You're right, the classic games are more evolved (like Castling in Chess is only a few hundred years old) than intentional but, well, there's a big difference in entertainment before the days where copyright came onto the scene.</blockquote>I don\u2019t understand what copyright has to do with this\u2026 Do you mean it simply as a date reference? I had to check, the first copyright law dates from 1662 and the first copyright dispute from 557, so I conclude it is probably not what you meant. Or do you mean copyright itself changed the reward question?\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite>And reward is still a part of it, heck it's a part of life in general. This caveman was smart enough to biuld a better spear, so he's rewarded by not starving to death next winter. </blockquote>He built a better spear to better eat. It is a consequence, but I don\u2019t think it as a reward. It is logical, setting-coherent. The gain of bettering a tool is to be more effective using the tool. The gain of bettering anything is getting better in it. Conversely, the setback for worsening anything is getting worse in it. These are purely logical consequences. How could they be rewards?<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite>But back to games, you can look at Monopoly, Life, Sorry, any classic board game for clear examples of reward (as well as more current stuff). </blockquote>I don\u2019t know Life nor Sorry, so I can not analyze them, but I cannot see any reward in Monopoly. It is a long time since I last played it, but I don\u2019t remember there was many decision to take, except buying or not buying, and sometime bartering. There are strategic choices, but I can\u2019t see anything there that I\u2019d call reward.\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite>I think your Tekken example is a good one particularly for story games because it reflects what many story games try to do, in terms of rewards. Rewards used to offset disappointment. So, when you lose a match, that's disappointment, but you get to play again for it unless it's your third loss in a row. If you win, that's satisfying, and rewarding in a non-mechanical way, but the cost is you have to pass the controller to someone else. A lot of story games entice players to get into conflict or difficult situations by using the mechanics. </blockquote>I can be seen a s a reward, yes. But I see it more as a mechanic to level the playing field to get better games. It is more of a menace then a recompense: if the stronger beats the weaker to a pulp, he is penalized with less play time. Meanwhile, the weaker progresses. A negative reward is, somehow, a reward nonetheless: a predetermined something, negative or positive, is added to the natural consequences to respectively hinder or bolster a given behavior. With intent. (It seems I am progressively narrowing down to a adequate definition.)\n<blockquote><cite>Alvin Frewer</cite>Perhaps we should explore those for what rewards might exist that don't jump out at you. What RPGs or board games do you enjoy and can you find some ways that they might reward you mechanically?</blockquote>From the top of my head: bonuses for adequately described how an action is performed (multiple games, usually house-ruled in anyway); Stars-Wars 1st ed.\u2019s force points (recover your spent force point and gain another if you spent your force point at a dramatically appropriate moment); Nightprowler\u2019s previously described Sellout; character weaknesses that bring XP when brought in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137087/#Comment_137087" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T04:45:36+00:00" title="March 31, 2008  4:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Thor Olavsrud</cite><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Interesting you mention Chess and Checkers ...

The real caveman is \u201calone\u201d in making is decision. The role-played caveman is multiple: there is the caveman as a character and his player who probably has different competing interest he must balance before reaching a decision.
