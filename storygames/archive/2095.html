                    Hey all, just wanted to chime in and see if folks were still burning away at their settings.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not sure if I'll be done in time, I just haven't had any time to allocate on this challenge, as work has been surprisingly busy even through the holiday season (man, I miss the days of just 'sitting around' for the last two weeks of the year). I also waffled a bit between Trollbabe and Nine Worlds before settling on TSOY.<br/><br/>But here's a taste of what I was fooling around with, we'll see how much further I can get. It's based on a very loose idea I had for a game a while back but never even put pen to paper for until now.<br/><br/>"NO DRAMATIC TITLE YET: A supplement for The Shadow of Yesterday"<br/><br/>The setting is half set in ancient Japan, half set in the modern world. The game is about how an enclave of powerful Onmyoji (Taoist seers/sorcerers) and their servants in ancient Heian Japan, circa 950AD. There are adventures to be had in that period with several "playsets", but the crux of the story takes place surrounding these mysterious events that happened called "The Massacre at Tenkuumon Temple" (not real), wherein a secret war led to the mysterious and horrible death by sword, claw, torch and curse of almost one hundred Taoist Sorcerers.<br/><br/>Cut to over a thousand years later, today's date. Again, mysterious forces are at work, and the Onmyoji killed at the Massacre are now being spontaneously reborn/reincarnated into the form of modern people, all over the world. They are rejoining into their alliances, trying to make sense of what happened and why. Meanwhile, They Fight Crime! (well, demons and stuff actually, but still)<br/><br/>The actual events of the Massacre will come out in play. The setting plays upon people who are all of two different traditions (modern and ancient), and how they interact in the confusing modern world, but it's definitely a conspiracy and monster-slaying game with that theme in the background. <br/><br/>The three pools for this TSOY setting are 'Ancient', 'Modern' and 'Magic'. The skills that the characters use will roll under whichever pool that fits that skill the most.  Social or Spirit-based stuff will fall under the most applicable pool (you will have to write a few descriptors like "job, position, etc" on your sheet for each Era, and you will tie your skill to one of those eras/descriptors: There will be a secret that lets you use both pools for one skill, etc).  Magic skills will fall under a few specific types: Divination, Fire, Summoning, Curse/Bless, etc.<br/><br/>That's about it. The hard part was providing structure to the Modern World part: It's basically a high-action World of Darkness, centered on Kyoto, Prague, Rabat, and New Orleans. It's hard to say, "OK Modern Day: GO!" and expect people to run with it.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Yeah, I'm still working on mine, but, if it gets finished, it may squeak through and, even then, may be disqualified for not really following the rules.  Depends on how it goes.<br/><br/>Like Andy, I waffled a bunch, originally hoping to do a <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> version of my "Folkways" concept, then switching to an American football version of <i>Agon</i> called "Gridiron Gods," and now possibly doing a game about the Chinese Civil War called "Red Star, White Sun" which doesn't have a system to go with it yet.  I might hack a kind of "TSOY Lite" that might work with it (sorta like how <i>The Princes' Kingdom</i> is "Dogs Lite"), but I'm not sure yet.<br/><br/>I've already posted about all three concepts in <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">my game design blog</a>, which pretty much shows the current state of my thinking about all three concepts, though I have a bunch of notes for "Gridiron Gods" that haven't been typed up yet.<br/><br/>I'm really excited about "Red Star, White Sun" right now because it's the culmination of recent thinking about how to present setting and discussions we've had here about casual games. The core of "Red Star, White Sun" is a bunch of trees that branch out and interconnect to form a web, but one with a series of starting points that clearly leads in a general direction.  Each point along the web of trees is a scene concept for one or more of the characters.  You can't enact scenes from high up in the trees until you do the necessary ones lower down.  Frex, you can't do the scene were one character shoots another until you do the scene where the first character acquires a gun.  But there are no scenes that have to happen.  So while all the different scenes that can possibly occur in the game have already been mapped out (the way character actions were mapped out in "Waiting/Tea," the game I wrote for <i>Push</i> 1), the players decide which ones actually happen, in which order, the results of those scenes, and what they actually mean to the overall narrative.  In effect, think of the scene framing in this game like choosing to turn to one page or another in a Choose Your Own Adventure book, but with more possible options and a lot more freedom to determine what happens once you turn to that page.<br/><br/>The problem, right now, is this is more like a mini-game or a way of presenting setting instead of a setting add-on to an existing game.  I'm considering going with TSOY and just calling these scene concepts Secrets. You'd buy new Secrets in order to move along the trees.  Frex, you could purchase The Secret of Sniping and then play the scene where your character joins a squad of snipers, so you'd accumulate abilities or interesting situations by accumulating Secrets.  Also, some scene concepts might work better as Keys.  "Do you go AWOL?" is a choice that could clearly be framed as a Key.<br/><br/>Anyway, still futzing around.  I'm going end up with at least two cool games out of this (I plan to finish both "Gridiron Gods" and "Red Star, White Sun"), but I don't know if either of them with be ready and/or submittable to the Setting Contest.  Which is pretty par for the course for me, actually.                        </div>

                            New Box Set, my setting for Shab al Hiri Roach with a band instead of a college will probably outgrow the game but, if I have a couple of evenings without work before the deadline will see the finish. then I will do the extra work to make it the game that it wants to be.                        </div>

<p>The text for "Legion of SuperScience" mostly exists in my head at this point. I haven't had time to write it all down. The system part will be easy, since <strong>InSpectres</strong> will handle a Venture Bros-ish setting out of the box. I'm making one name change ("franchise" becomes "org",) introducing different limitations on weird characters, and changing the way story structure is handled. I might add one or two other things.</p>
<p>What I've mostly been doing is necessary graphics for the character/org sheets and cover. First version didn't scale right when I tried to do layout and looked too jagged. If the most recent version doesn't work, I'll leave it jagged for now.</p>
