But never got into the games. They all seemed to have the gloss, but not any of the stuff the fiction was actually about.<br/><br/>I remember being at a Reader Con years ago and people saying, "Oh, yeah, Gibson and Sterling were all done with Cyberpunk before it got big. They were writing about Colonization and Balkanized Economics... and everyone else was writing about chrome."<br/><br/>Reading your first post made me go... "Oh, I want to do this!"<br/><br/>My first impulse reactions:<br/><br/>You're hedging on your first Agenda.<br/>* Make the world seem real, <i>if not</i> surreal.<br/><br/>Because, remember, those guys were doing future shock for <i>then</i>. There's no need to recreate the 80s view of future crazy. What we we extrapolate now?<br/><br/>As for the Attributes, I have my own take on the Attributes for AW. I think AW has one point of view on them. And I think DW has another. I'm not saying different names. I mean, the philosophy underpinning their use and meaning in play.<br/><br/>From <i>my</i> view (which for all I know is utterly idiosyncratic and useless) is that looking at "influence" is a kind of a red flag. For <i>me</i>.<br/><br/>If you think emotionally about the characters first, not what they can do, how do they handle <i>themselves</i>. How do they feel most comfortable <i>with themselves</i> in stressful situations. Where do they feel most vulnerable <i>with themselves</i> in stressful situations. Then marry that with the fiction and stew and see what you come up with.<br/><br/>Cyberpunk characters are damaged, protective, put on Cool to keep the world at bay, fierce because they're scared out of their minds because society has gone apeshit and does''t give a fuck about anyone. They build tight, really tight, circles, because <i>if </i>they're going to trust someone, they're going to really trust them.<br/><br/>Some of them feel comfortable making other people wish the were as cool as them. Some feel best killing and not thinking about it. Some are most comfortable when they get to get the fuck away from other people (hello, cyberspace!)<br/><br/>Think, "Where are the characters most good at feeling good in this pulp-noir-surreal-sf fiction -- knowing nobody is going to feel comfortable in all areas. (A feature, not a bug!) <br/><br/>That's how I'd look at it and start.<br/><br/>Random thoughts.

I'm glad you called me on it. Partly, I am just not sure what should be Agenda and what should be Principles.  "Barrage the players with details about the world" says more about what I want than that first Agenda. My first encounter to cyberpunk lit was <i>Neuromancer</i>, and I swear I read that first page five times before I realized I was just going to have to accept that I didn't understand everything right now. More than Future Shock, I want Information Overload. That's an important part of cyberpunk for me. <br/><br/>I liked the zones because I was thinking about characters about their relationships to the world, not "what they can do." To me, zones answer "how am I connected?" But you have the Right of it, regarding "damaged, protected," etc. Monsterhearts has a "damaged characters" approach to attributes, so I might look at that. I love this advice, though, and I'll give it a hard think.<br/><br/>However, I want to point out that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Sprawl</span> that thadrine linked is <i>fucking awesome</i>. It adapts CP2020 to the AW engine with a particular kind of insight. That is, CP2020, with all of its shallow understanding of actual CP literature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424169/#Comment_424169" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T13:35:42+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  1:35PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I love that new Agenda.

Here's the thing--it's gonna vastly change what you think the game is about. When I see cyberpunk, I agree that "zones of influence" isn't where it's at. On the flip side, though, you could totally use zones of influence to make a game that's all about your position in the wheels within wheels in a cybercorp-controlled city. But it'd be a political game, a cyber intrigue game, which isn't really what I think of when I think of cyberpunk.<br/><br/>That being said, you could borrow from Bonds and Strings to handle the question of "who am I connected to?"

I think the most important thing you need is a way to get players to commit to cherishing things pretty much from the beginning, then. Yeah?<br/><br/>(I have a game kinda like this kicking around in my WIP folders, only in that game the MC is out to destroy everything, so there's less pressure on players to care about something right away.)<br/><br/>In any case, that sounds like your second agenda right there. In the normal schema for the MC's 3 agendas, number 1 is the kind of world you're trying to portray (a real one or a fantastic one, for example) and number 2 is what challenges the PCs (a life "not boring" or lives full of adventure, for example). Making things "not boring" works in AW because the setting is already post-apocalyptic. The MC agendas take this for granted when they say to make it real and make it not boring, because pretty much everyone is going to make a post-apocalyptic setting that is not boring be dangerous (and then there's the rest of the book to back that up).<br/><br/>But if the PCs in your cyberpunk game are struggling "to hold onto the things they hold dear as soulless corporations impersonally strip everything away" then as the MC you're not really there to "make their lives compelling," you're there to destroy their lives.<br/><br/>What I would do in this case (and this might not be the game you want) is to have the rules of the game--playbooks, character creation, etc--make the players build lives for their PCs, and not leave it on the MC's shoulders to do that. Because not everybody will go right from "make their lives compelling" to "soulless corporations impersonally strip everything away."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_424231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424231/#Comment_424231" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T04:08:22+00:00" title="November 15, 2013  4:08AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not convinced it would work anyway; the typical cyberpunk character in fact has nothing they hold dear.

What I remember about Case's initial situation from Neuromancer, he was already in a downward spiral ready to meet his eventual end in Chiba-- he was basically suicidal and reckless. Still, you could say he held dear the ability to jack into the Matrix and escape his body. <br/><br/>Islands In The Net seems more in line with the notion of a protagonist that is fighting for that which she holds dear, but that's usually labeled as a "post-cyberpunk" work.<br/><br/>Seems to me that the  dominant theme of classic cyberpunk is the relationship between humanity and technology, regardless of whether the protagonists are hunting Replicants or doing a run on Straylight .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424245/#Comment_424245" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T10:03:26+00:00" title="November 15, 2013 10:03AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Case was a classic example of the loner who pretends he doesn't care about anything, but it turns out that he mostly cares about his own brain and wits, so the GM (er, Armitage) threatens that with a mycotoxin, and now Case is on a mission that he probably wouldn't have accepted otherwise.
