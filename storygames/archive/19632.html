If you want to have play where the players actually have to map and orienteer themselves, then it's pretty essential to provide them subjective directions (various reasons - there was a thread about mapping best practices in OSR play a while back, might be interesting). If you merely want to communicate space efficiently, then you should draw the map for them, literally or figuratively. Part of that "drawing" might be being straightforward about directions and distances: "the thing you're looking for is here, let me point out the general area on your map."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436171/#Comment_436171" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T12:14:12+00:00" title="August  1, 2014 12:14PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In both of our B/X groups we\u2019ve done explicit, direct, \u201cGM draws the map as we go\u201d mapping, but in this group we want to try not doing that.

For example, the Finnish language terminology for this relies on the sun: "east" is where the sun rises each day, "west" is where it sets, "north" is to the left when facing east (the notional "top" of the world in the primitive Finno-Ugric scheme), "south" is the right. You don't need to have a compass to have the concept of global direction.<br/><br/>Sedentary people generally have a good sense for the directions because they've been observing the landmarks in relation to how the sun rises and sets around their home. In strange places traditional ways to figure out the directions may involve a bunch of complementary techniques, such as observing the growth of plants (mosses on trees are a favourite around here), flight patterns of migrating birds, winds (on coasts and sea) and the stars (Finns generally find north by observing the Pole Star, with help from the Big Dipper).<br/><br/>All this still makes it entirely possible for a person to be disoriented, especially in a strange place through a time-span of hours or a few days in cloudy weather. Historical methods of orienteering generally do not work underground, but certain D&amp;D fantasy things might help - dwarves might sense magnetic fields directly, for example, like birds.<br/><br/>Considering all this, I would say that if you have an adventure where somebody is directly referencing compass directions as the means of orientation, but they are underground, then clearly they either have a compass, or some supernatural means of orientation specific to the fantasy milieu, or the author just hasn't been thinking much when writing that bit. If they're not underground, then this really isn't that problematic: a normal person knows which way is north in their home town, compasses or no compasses.<br/><br/>(Regarding Forgotten Realms specifically, I seem to remember that it's set on a planet similar to Earth except somewhat larger; orienteering against the sun and the axis of spin of the planet should therefore work similarly, so they have the same cardinal directions that Earth does, and the same basic ways of finding out which way is which.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436190/#Comment_436190" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T13:25:54+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  1:25PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The direction is to the smithy itself.

Sometimes there may be iron or other magnetic material in the walls, in which case a compass close to the wall is a problem (and such impurities may be present in your gear also).<br/><br/>Cavers have made extensive maps of complex cave systems, predicting connections and such using compasses, clinometers, and tape measures.<br/><br/>Old school dungeons were so rectilinear though that using compass directions as shorthand is not that unreasonable (and they also had diagonal passages intended to confuse such mapping). Maybe the actual characters don't have a compass and know the true orientation, but a shorthand orientation would be fine. Of course in such games, the mapping puzzle was developed as part of the game, and to the extent that everyone is on the same page with that puzzle being part of the game, who cares how "realistic" it is. It's no less realistic that most of the abilities of the PCs...<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436214/#Comment_436214" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T22:29:53+00:00" title="August  1, 2014 10:29PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is this scenario which I\u2019ve daydreamed up and worry about:<br/>The players hear the word \u201csoutheast\u201d and ask \u201cwere can we get a compass\u201d and I go \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and they quit playing the game and never come back and I get sad.<br/>That was kind of the scenario...
