But over in a thread about starting equipment packages, I saw:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>because obviously, a horse's a pretty expensive thing, right?</blockquote>\nAnd it felt weird.  After thinking about it, I think that my what's a horse worth is more informed by cowboy fiction than fantasy fiction.  I think the value of a horse in cowboy stories ranges hugely.  Like some random old soap-bones of a nag is essentially free for the taking.  But the best horse in the territory (for whatever <i>best</i> means to an individual character) is worth as much as a silver mine.<br/><br/>So I'm reading about how a starting character in OSR/D&amp;D can't afford a horse and I'm totally not looking at any games or price lists and thinking that's kind of weird.<br/><br/>Is there some actual* reason that horses should be more expensive in fantasy Europe than in Wild West?<br/><br/>Where 'actual' really just means 'interesting' I guess.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366788/#Comment_366788" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T09:57:12+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  9:57AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantasy, who knows, maybe they are hatched by elves, but in actual history a 12th century horse was a pretty valuable piece of property. A horse requires a constellation of skilled craftsmen and handlers to keep it shod, harnessed, healthy and trained.  It was likely the product of careful selective breeding. If it was bred for war it carried not only a distinct military advantage but also served as a symbol of nobility and office. If it was bred for work it could change the fortunes of the people who relied on its labor, who would otherwise be doing that labor themselves.<br/><br/>In contrast, the 19th century marks the apex of horse-related industry and technology, but even with their ubiquity they were still valuable property.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366794/#Comment_366794" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:07:35+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Horses being expensive in D&amp;D always made sense to me, but I never put any effort into checking if it was actually true. I just did some googling.<br/><br/>I went on equine.com and horse prices range from a several thousand to 20 thousand and up. That's a very wide range, but it means that even for a cheap horse you're going to blow a well-situated person's monthly salary, not counting food, lodging and all that. I've also been watching the HBO show Luck recently, which is about horse racing, and horses certainly aren't cheap to buy or maintain (I know, it's a show, but I doubt their numbers are off, Milch tends to be particular about it).<br/><br/>Then I found a list of prices from medieval England (on luminarium.org). A war horse is given two different pricings, up to 50 shillings and up to 80 pounds (the first price is from the 12th and the second from the 13th century). The cheapest price listed in 10 shillings for a draught horse (in the 13th century). A good cow is also 10 shillings.<br/><br/>Then you have the expenses for "feeding a knight's or merchant's household" which range from 30 to 100 pounds. These prices are all over the darn place and from different periods however.<br/><br/>Wikipedia says a destrier could be "seven times to 700 times the price of an ordinary horse", but I can't find what the value of an "ordinary horse was".<br/><br/>One way or another, buying a good, war-trained horse was probably well beyond the financial capacities of the ordinary peasant.<br/><br/>I bet someone on here has better numbers for all that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366799/#Comment_366799" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:12:39+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is totally something that should be informed by your understanding of the world in general and your setting in particular. For example, in our setting the price of horses is informed by the following points:<ul><li>The LotFP price list is around in most sessions, so if I don't have a clue I'll look there for suggestions.</li><li>The setting is sort of late middle ages for the most part. There is a large military pressure on the horse, and there are economic limitations on horse pasture, and there are no specialized horse breeders in large scale.</li><li>Individual horses will wary in price very much, based on breeding, training, health and age. A horse that is fit for farm work is cheaper than one that is fit for serious riding is cheaper than one that is fit for nobility is cheaper than one that suits war is even still cheaper than the most expensive of them all, the horse that has both the breeding and training for carrying heavy battle harness. The price from cheapest to most expensive varies by several orders of magnitude, but still even the cheapest horse is well beyond the means of the poor cottar, while being quite affordable for rural middle-class (meaning, land-owning farmer).</li><li>The individual sales situation: what is available and at what price is different in the rural town and the big city, for example. Buying excess horseage will give you "base price" (what is estimated as the "actual value" of the horse, meaning the value the seller thinks he would get from somebody else with little difficulty), while buying a horse somebody actually has an use for will easily double the price, or even more.</li></ul>\nIn practice the above means that we end up with horses costing anything from 50 gold pieces to a thousand gold pieces, as arbitrarily translated by myself right now from our campaign currencies to "standard D&amp;D gold". It's something I can allow a 1st level character to have, but we will have to talk it over to make sure the player either explains to me where his character got the horse, or I explain to him how his horse is a pretty poor quality ride, not a war horse of any quality like a player might imagine without such discussion. A well-connected knight will get his war-horse cheaper than the suspicious adventurer, of course, and you can end up paying ridiculous sums (how about 10 000 gold?) for a special horse, which might simply mean a rare hotblooded prestige/war lineage instead of something blatantly magical like D&amp;D usually has.<br/><br/>What the above-described setting seems in practice is, if you see a man on horseback you'll know that he's well-to-do. The lower classes might use a rural-quality horse as a draft-animal (maybe I used that term correctly?), the middle-class might use a riding horse of some sort or a carriage, while routinely riding from place to place and having a personal horse for getting from place to place is totally a high-class enterprice. It is not uncommon in the medieval parts of the setting to see people use oxen as work animals, doing the bulk of the animal work in the agriculture, simply because there are not enough good horses going about. Things are a bit different in the rich fantasy Netherlands on the other side of the Goblin Hills, where people are in general more well-to-do and crushing poverty of the middle ages is giving way: you can see say merchant-class young men riding about, easily enough. The poor guy is still going to sell the horse if he gets one; he has little need for it, and the money will last him quite a while in simple provender.<br/><br/>If our setting was wild west, horses would totally be a magnitude cheaper than they end up being in practice. Also the same if the game was set in the great continental plains (Poland and to the east, essentially), where horse pasture is easier, distances are greater, the culture is horse-prolific (no cultural pressure towards utilizing the horse exclusively for military and elite needs) and light cavalry is the dominant default arms state militarily. I wouldn't put an excellent horse in a wild west setting at more than a hundred, few hundred gold pieces at most, and I'll totally make you a deal for 10 gp on a second-class piece of horseflesh. I might well be mistaken here, of course - I've got a lot more medieval European history under my belt than wild west. Still, the horse would be much cheaper for sure. Even such a basic thing as continuous breeding had already impacted the basic quality of the horse massively in the intervening 500 years; the middle-ages horse could vary widely in size alone, making the majority of horses totally unfeasible for heavy war harness, which made the few suitable horses much more valuable. The wild west horse will not vary in quality so much, so concretely, which means that the quality factor won't impact the prices so much.<br/><br/>Please note that I describe the current running assumptions of our campaign above. I have long ago realized that history and "realism" in general is a process, not an end-state. If somebody wants to school me on what horses really would cost in say 14th century Germany or 16th century Netherlands, I'm all ears and grateful, and will put such knowledge to good use. As with all matters in the campaign, we just run with our best current knowledge on any random particulars. In some places we're so far closer to realistic than basic D&amp;D that it's not even funny, but I'm sure that we've actually managed to create our own funny logical holes in other places, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366803/#Comment_366803" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:19:45+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:19AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, also: the modern price of the horse is inflated in comparison with how much it could cost in e.g. a wild west situation. The horse today is like a roleplaying game, a specialty hobby instead of the primary industrial unit of work it was in the first centuries after the middle ages. There is no industrial breeding anymore, that alone is going to bring the price up by an order of magnitude, I would think. Of course the lack of commercial need is going to bring down the prices, too: you would pay more for a horse in the 19th century simply because you actually needed it for something more than fun-making. Today the horse is priced solely on the fun-factor in most parts of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366820/#Comment_366820" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:57:55+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:57AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A random, half-remembered data point:  I see to recall seeing that at some point during the Roman Empire, the iron in the bit in the horse's mouth was worth more than the horse itself.

Buy a big house, spend it all in frivolous orgies, donate it to the temple - who cares, there's more in the next dungeon! Or try to use your wealth to truly change the world, and learn the difference between a thousand and a million gold pieces: mercenary armies, wizardly experiments, buying influence in court, these are all things that will drain your war chest right quick <i>even as</i> you're insanely wealthy by peasant standards.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go back to the 3rd edition philosophy of buying magical items even if you paid me, that's how strongly I feel about this: I think it's absolutely great that you have a 1000-gold threshold at the plate armour price that makes gods of men, but after that purchase is done everybody's on the same level, whether pauper or king.

Bronco bustin' anyone?  My point being, when the spaniards hit the continent, a bunch of horses got away and bred themselves just fine... very different than Europe.  By the time of the "cowboys", there were bucketloads of horses out there.  And there was the space to raise them.  Price for a good horse would be considerable, but not extravagant.  <br/><br/>Also, consider the Mongol and the Tartar and other such nomads... they had space to raise horses too and they did.  It seems to me, pretty much everyone had a horse in a Mongol village as the damn thing tend to move around quite a bit.  Plus a few as pack animals.  Now, Mongol horses are tiny compared to european warhorses....but then again, those tiny ponies and 40,000 men conquered Russia.  Something Nappy and the mustached goon from Germany never did (good politicking helped too, but still , damn impressive).  And oh yeah, the Mongol Empire stretched from China to Poland when it was all said and done.  That is a lot of real estate....  And that horde certainly had very, very well trained horses.  <br/><br/>Cowboys often had two, something I've taken into my fantasy games, especially for "expeditions".  Switching off load, saddle and rider between the horses to give one a rest 1/2 the time.  <br/><br/>So.  What does your D&amp;D locale look like?  It will have a huge impact on the cost of a horse.

So I sent them back in time with minimal equipment and very little cash (which they needed to pretend was foreign currency and trade in before they could use).<br/><br/>One of the characters came back with his horse and some good armor, because he was playing Gawain and that's part of his identifying shtick. The rest were without mounts.<br/><br/>Scrounging together basic adventuring equipment was part of the fun of the campaign and we played it up to the hilt. The 2 female characters pawned their fancy ball gowns they'd been wearing when they came through time, which gave them considerably more cash than the other characters, which was amusing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366873/#Comment_366873" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T12:50:08+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 12:50PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Horses are cheap.
