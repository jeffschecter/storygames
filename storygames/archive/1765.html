                    A while back, I was riffing on a few different ideas for alternate reality games, some of which were based on tag. (<a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/474861.html?nc=14" rel="nofollow">Zombie Tag</a>) I'm curious if a game powered by Tag sparks any ideas in folks here. To get juices flowing, perhaps we could brainstorm converting existing games to Tag-based systems?                </div>

                            In high school we played a game that revolved around passing a bent nickel from one person to another.  Whoever had the nickel had <i>the blame</i> - they were the goat for anything that went wrong.  Having the blame was a bad thing.  You had to offer the blame, and your target had to actively accept it (it's reflexive to hold open your hand when someone offers you something).  The blame got passed in all sorts of situations - during commencement, while swimming, on stage during a performance of Our Town, and so forth.  <br/><br/>It had the stigmatizing focus of tag, with the addition of social engineering and a physical object.                        </div>

                            In college, we had a reverse tag like Jason's but it was about favors. At one point, Nikolai found in a classroom this metallic coin-like button which said "GRIPNAIL" on it. It became the "GRIPNAAG", a one single item that was used to curry favour with friends. If you happened to have it (and there was only one) and you got to class, and all the "comfy chairs" were taken (in many of our classes half the chairs were rigid, the others soft), you could walk up to someone in the group and say, "I'll give you the GRIPNAAG for that chair". And the chair-sitter would be obliged to swap. It was a "tag" of minor favour; could only be redeemed for things like "doing the dishes", "a single Taco at Taco Bell", items or events of convenience (the aforementioned chair swapping, etc). It was like <i>giving tag</i>.<br/><br/>EDIT: This is a GRIPNAAG (but it didn't have the sharp pointy thing on it)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.gripnail.com/img/gn_1.jpg"/><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I understand that a game amongst my set, "Vampire Tag," was invented in Rochester NY in the early 90's.<br/><br/>We play in the dark of night on large sprawling wooden playgrounds. (Yes, this leads to injury.)<br/><br/>We have three foam props -- a cross and two stakes -- which someone scatters around the playground. <br/><br/>We have a numbered deck of cards, one card for each player. One of these cards is specially marked. The cards are shuffled and handed out; whomever gets the marked card is the Vampire. Everyone else is human. These roles are secret.<br/><br/>The game begins with a loud countdown from ten. People scatter to all corners of the playground. When the countdown ends, the hunt begins.<br/><br/>You may only travel freely on the wooden structure. Stepping in the sand gets you stuck; you must count aloud to ten before you can move again.<br/><br/>The Vampire has a few special powers:<br/> - by touching a human on the shoulder near the neck, a Vampire can turn a human into a Vampire.<br/> - once only, a Vampire can grab a human on an arm or leg and shout "Grab!" to turn the human into a Vampire.<br/> - once only, a Vampire may shout "Bat!" and move in a straight line across the sand.<br/> - A Vampire turned human, who later becomes a Vampire again, regains the use of this "once only" powers.<br/><br/>Humans' only weapon against the Vampires are the (foam) cross and stakes.<br/> - A human may jab a stake into the chest or back of a Vampire to turn it into a human. He must then throw the stake away, across the playground.<br/> - A human may hold up the cross, crying "I invoke the cross!" to send all Vampires running away. He must then throw the cross away, across the playground.<br/> - A human may brandish the cross at arm's length. Vampires may not approach a cross held out in this manner.<br/><br/>The game ends when everyone is a Vampire or everyone is a human. This is determined by shouting "Vampire [Human] Check!", and then everyone who is a Vampire [Human], in order of the numbers on their cards, shouts their number. So if you hear "1!" "2!" "3!" "..." When there are more than three players, you know that not everyone has yet become a Vampire and you keep hunting.<br/><br/>I love it because it's crazy dangerous in the dark, because I become a ninja on the playground, and because everyone always ends up on the winning side. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            That remindsme of a really great larp I was in. Every player was possessed by a half-dozen or so spirit personalities, ranging from historical figures to mythical creatures. By default, one of the personalities was dominant, but the others took control when certain triggers occurred (i.e. the Werewolf personality taking over when you walked into the light of the full moon).<br/><br/>One of the many subplots in the game was the Alien Spider Virus vs. the Alien Raptor Virus. They both functioned identically, but were enemies. The virus normally had the lowest priority of any of your personalities, and thus would never assert control except under the specific triggers. They were:<br/><br/>1) When you were alone with one other person.<br/>2) When you were in a group where everybody but one had been infected by your virus.<br/>3) When you were attacked by the enemy virus.<br/><br/>When any of those triggers hit, you went batshit crazy and attacked the relevant target, giving him a copy of the virus personality when you won.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this was just one of the personality-subplots in a 12-hour all-night larp featuring the Knights of the Round Table, Egyptian Gods, Werewolves and Vampires, Greek Heroes, and a dozen or so more.<br/><br/>The best time (relevant to the viruses) was when I was in a group consisting of three people infected with the Spider Virus and two infected with the Raptor virus. None of the triggers were tripped... until one of the people with Raptor left the group. And then there was one fewer Raptor out there.                        </div>

                            Is there an American equivalent of "bullrush"?<br/><br/>You start with one tagger, who calls out individuals from the group - they have to run between two lines while the tagger attempts to tag them. The tagger has to stay between the lines, which represent two "safe" zones for the runners. If the runner is tagged they join the tagger's team between the lines, and call out the next person. <br/><br/>At any time, the person calling out can call "bullrush" and everyone who's not been tagged rushes between the marks, trying to avoid being tagged by anyone. I think the last person tagged becomes the first caller in the next game.<br/><br/>Seems to me that could be adapted to a zombie theme pretty easily.<br/><br/>EDIT: sorry, just found it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullrush_game" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>. I think I got the rules slightly wrong too (a bullrush occurs when someone makes it to the other line, apparently). <br/><br/>In my defence I haven't played it in about 30 years.                        </div>

As a kid? I've only ever played Vampire tag with adults. Kids aren't on the playgrounds after dark, leaving the space wide open for us. I'm fairly sure the game was inspired partly by Vampire: the Masquerade LARP, which was huge in Rochester colleges around the time of the game's inception.                        </div>
