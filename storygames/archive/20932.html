Because, however seemingly harmless, it still supports the ungrateful practice of piracy in a small, self publishing marketplace? Or does the fact that the author's game is still being enjoyed by others, outweigh pirating of a game (which I honestly consider to be the biggest asshole move in indie gaming, other than sexually harassing someone at the table)? I know this is very subjective and likely one will never get a consensus, but for someone very passionate about indie games and playing as many as possible, it may be a conundrum they face.

This CD is free, so feel free to take one." (Here, often the invited artists would feel some consternation, or at least surprise!) "While you take the album, however, you must leave a donation of $20, which goes towards their NEXT album."<br/><br/>His message was, roughly, that:<br/><br/>* This artist has already produced a good, which they have already slaved over and released into the wild. The "work" is done. It has been paid for, in whatever combination of hours and money.<br/>* You can probably find it or steal it, if you really try, for free.<br/>* However, supporting the artist is important, because it allows them to keep creating and to put out more content. They probably put themselves in debt (even if metaphorically; but usually such commitment to creation costs money, as well), and you supporting them will help them continue their efforts and create more in the future.<br/><br/>I think that games deserve to be played and shared. If it's possible to renumerate the designer (and whoever else was involved), I would make an effort to locate them and offer them something.<br/><br/>Like Eero, I think it would be a shame if people didn't play a game just because they couldn't find it in print - surely there's some universal value in human beings having fun, getting to know each other, and being creative together? Surely that's a net benefit to the human race, at some level.<br/><br/>Eero, I have some questions for you concerning copyright.

I don't think violating copyright law is a moral issue in cases where you are dealing with multinational corporations making billions and artists making millions, but I do think it is an issue in the indie gaming market. Most indie RPGs are self published and the authors deserve to be payed for their work (edit: when one values their work enough to use it). Like I said in another thread, if you don't think people should be paid for their work, (edit: when one values their work enough to use it) try working a week at McDonald's for free.<br/>That being said, I really appreciate that your publisher games and share them via Creative Commons,  but because of my outlook; even though I could get your games for free, I chose to pay for them. I also think it's practical issue, I want some of the ideas  found an indie games to become more widespread in the role playing game market. Take for example, Fiasco and <a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar%27s">@Jason_Morningstar's</a> games  that have become popular and broken into a larger market;   Jason wouldn't be able to do this unless he was fairly paid for his work. So there's a practical side as well. The same might be true of Vincent; I know the reason he has become able to make games full-time  is because he  it's starting to make a living by making games. This frees up it's time to make more games. So whether it's a moral issue or not, I personally think there's reasons to pay  for games. Although, I certainly respect your position and the fact that you offer your games for free. And, I think there are certain circumstances; for example, the case outlined in the original post, where exceptions should be granted. But I did want to discuss the issue with publishers who charge for their games.  I would love to hear your ideas regarding what I've discussed in this post <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459334/#Comment_459334" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-16T21:28:45+00:00" title="January 16, 2017  9:28PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2017 9:38PM by Simonpaulburley.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I charge for all my games because I feel that that shows that I believe they're worth paying for.

We can wrangle over it for the sake of philosophy, though, if you want. A bunch of facile rhetoric incoming!\n<blockquote>Most indie RPGs are self published and the authors deserve to be payed for their work.</blockquote>\nI disagree about authors deserving to be paid for their work. If that were true, either the amount of the payment would be negotiable ("You get one euro for your game - it's just not very good"), or anybody could make a ton of money by pushing out trash games. If it's the former, then that statement just doesn't say much - sure, maybe everybody deserves to get paid, but if what they deserve is 30 cents per head, who cares?<br/><br/>This isn't merely facile rhetoric, but a fundamental philosophical problem for society: who gets to decide what you do for living, and who gets to decide how much wealth doing that accrues to you. Most people nowadays are pretty keen on an individualistic market exchange society of some sort, so the answer probably won't be "the board of Indie RPG Critics" or "everybody gets paid, no matter how sucky they are". Rather, I think most of us here are pretty happy with the idea that the market decides how much value your work has, and nobody is actually entitled to being paid for their work just because they wanted to make a roleplaying game that nobody asked them to make.<br/><br/>(I also disagree with the idea that it's OK to rip off non-indie RPG designers, while self-publishers have special entitlements. We all play by the same rules, far as I know.)<br/><br/>So if we're all agreeing about the market being the one to determine who gets paid, how does that work in practice with digital piracy? The short answer for me is that it does not - there simply is no feasible way to make it work, long term. The system will continue functioning on sheer momentum for a while, but in the end it's going to boil down to either a police state or a new social contract over artist rights, one that minimally legalizes non-commercial digital distribution.<br/><br/>(The practical reasons for my belief on this matter are complex and have to do with economics, information theory and all sorts of assorted philosophical bullshit. The important part is that I do not believe in the practicality of trying to regulate an old-style copyright market in a world of digital freedom. Either you curb the freedoms, or you accept free exchange of information.)<br/><br/>Thus, my argument for the moral folly of anti-piracy: the anti-piracy ethos only makes sense if traditional copyright is a system worthy and capable of being saved. If it either should not, or cannot, be saved, then it's still cool for a person to personally hold onto the copyright values, but it becomes rather morally suspect to try to force others to do the same with peer pressure or legal action or other such techniques of moral persuasion. A person arguing for copyright in a world where copyright has become untenable is essentially just causing grief by postponing an inevitable change; worst case, they encourage the perpetuation  of copyright-friendly repressive structures that attempt to force what can only be forced at a far too high a price to society.<br/><br/>(Price to society? In my eyes, the choice is not between piracy and copyright so much as it is between a world where copyright is essentially unforceable, and we gain all the benefits of free information, or a world where everybody's computers are registered in a Big Brother system of digital validation, with regular policing of unauthorized hardware. That's what it takes, technologically speaking, to stop non-commercial digital piracy, and I don't think it's worth it. Any half-way measures are just causing grief for no good reason to cherry-picked people who are all acting out of natural, often laudable impulses.)<br/><br/>Were one to take my thesis at face value for the sake of the argument, namely that copyright has become dysfunctional and needs to be discarded, then what about that artist who may or may not deserve payment; how does society decide on that, then? I believe that pre-orders will be the short-term solution, but 50 years from now it's all going to be back to patron-client models, like it was 500 years ago. It just makes the most sense for society in a free information environment to pay the artist in advance or at the time of publication, instead of trying to enforce an a posteori monopoly for the artist to make their money afterwards.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, that's a problem for the artists and audiences of the future to solve, because we (you) don't owe them (us) a living.\n<blockquote>I also think it's practical issue, I want some of the ideas  found an indie games to become more widespread in the role playing game market.</blockquote>\nI don't feel much need to argue with this practical observation. I don't think it's quite that simple, but the basic principle is somewhat sound: pay a person, and they will work for you. We are in rough agreement on the practical consequences of giving people money.<br/><br/>Specifically, the reason why I don't think this has much to do with the problem of piracy is that if you just think that people should give money to artists they want to support, surely that then also implies <i>not</i> giving money to artists you <i>don't</i> want to support. And if this is the case, we're basically just saying that you should only pay artists when you feel like doing so, and this needs not have any particular connection to whether you consume their art or not; if you don't pay, surely it is because you do not want to, at this time, support this artist. Makes sense to me, but that means that piracy is no longer a moral or social issue - it's just a case-by-case preference.

Personally, I'd be very satisfied with some kind of game-related <i>tenure</i> (yeah, keep dreaming!). But what about living off the generosity of an individually wealthy patron who enjoys my games? Or getting a well-paid job which isn't game-related at all, but leaves me a lot of free time (like, something where I only have to work a couple days a week to earn my living)? Inheriting a small fortune? I know none of those options seem very <i>realistic</i> - although, think about it, those are what was there for writers or other sorts of artists for a very long time - but let's be honest: to earn a living wage out of selling the story games one designs as a full-time job isn't the most realistic expectation either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459340/#Comment_459340" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T01:40:18+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  1:40AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some very interesting discussion is still going on here; excellent.<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>The reason I asked about copyright was not a matter of copyright law (which I don't assume you to have any kind of expertise handling, and is in trouble, anyway, due to digital media and globalization - as you say, it may soon become outdated).<br/><br/>Rather, it's about the higher-order concerns, such as you are discussing here.<br/><br/>Like you, I value free access to information, for the benefits it grants to society, civilization, and perhaps even the human race. If I was elected World President and asked to decide on this issue at this very moment, I would be very tempted to adopt a fully libertarian stance on information - free and available for everyone.<br/><br/>However, the impact of copyright protection on creative endeavours is enormous. In this context, it affects the level, quality, and availability of the products, their development, their distribution, and their advancement.<br/><br/>It's not hard to what would happen if our dear Jeff suddenly become a billionaire. Perhaps he would offer to pay $1,000,000 (or some other hefty sum in your preferred currency) to the best 10 games anyone could produce for his game club. This would create a revolution in game design, playtesting, online discussion, and, likely, evolution in gaming practices. People could afford to hire playtesters, experiment with new mediums, organize events where players test rule variants, pay "performers" who learn to play games at the highest level of skill, produce YouTube videos teaching people to play Rolemaster or Aftermath, and so forth. We can only imagine what developments story games would undergo (much like how Kickstarter/crowdfunding technology has really upped the ante on game product quality in the last five years).<br/><br/>This is, in a sense, what happens when copyright is enforceable on a certain medium. When a creator has a sense of security in her product become monetizable, she is able to leverage a whole other level of commitment to excellence. <br/><br/>Sure, art and craft will always be around. We'll always have people playing instruments, competing in sports, making paintings, and (hopefully, but less certainly) designing story games.<br/><br/>However, laws like copyright protection have a powerful influence on the scope and quality of these activities. A perfect example is the recent boom of the Chinese film industry - for decades, there has been no way to enforce copyright (or no interest in doing so) in China, and, while many independent films were made, the Chinese are hardly seen as world players when it comes to the silver screen. However, in recent times, they have started implementing copyright laws with regards to film, and now the Chinese film industry is roughly *tripling* (!!!) in size every year. We're seeing bigger budgets, better effects, bigger productions, better actors, etc, etc, etc. Some people are saying that by 2025, Chinese cinema will surpass Hollywood in every measure (profits, budgets, etc).<br/><br/>Give people the idea that a certain creative work can be reliably monetized, and that field grows quickly, both in size and in quality. This is, effectively, one of the things that copyright laws do for us.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where that leaves us, but it could explain Jeff's attitude here - as you point out, saying that "creators deserve to be paid for their work" is a somewhat self-defeating statement from a logical standpoint, but as a sort of voluntary moral stance, it makes total sense. In theory, we could agree to support a certain form of art financially, and if enough of us do so, the whole level of the artform rises up, evolves, develops. <br/><br/>Is there, then, some benefit to this kind of law to balance against the values of free information?<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the answers are - and I do like seeing the success of crowdfunding platforms for games, even if it leaves less serious designers like myself in the dust - but I will mention that there may be other possible outcomes than the two extremes you posit (either a tyrannical police state or total piracy).<br/><br/>We know as game designers that all kinds of different incentives can be designed into a system, and if you set them up right, sometimes you can get the effect you want without the consequences you don't want. For instance, in a lot of art fields, there are effective ways to compensate people for their work without limiting their work's impact. For example, many countries collect a tax which they then redistribute to artists according to the impact of their work. <br/><br/>For instance, until recently the radio music system in North America was quite reliable. Union-like organizations collected a pool of money every year (as a general tax, or a tax on certain types of profits), then tracked which radio stations played which songs, and how many times. Then they used that data to redistribute the money to the artists who were being played the most.<br/><br/>It's not too hard to imagine some system along these lines working for other media (radio, after all, is hardly as popular as it used to be). It works (though not extremely efficiently, granted), and it doesn't <i>limit anyone's access to the products</i>. None of the people involved have any incentive to circumvent the process - if I run a radio station, I have no reason not to play whatever music I think my listeners want to hear. Listeners aren't limited - they can listen to any music they want - and artists are still compensated.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the future we can find new, better ways of accomplishing this kind of thing? The availability of high-quality art (craft, sport, etc) is a public good in itself, and worth thinking about. <br/><br/>I'd love to hear your* thoughts on all this. My ideas here are fairly idle thought, not terribly well considered; I'm just brainstorming a little on the topic, based on some basic knowledge.<br/><br/><br/>*: Applying equally to Eero, Jeff, or any other reader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459343/#Comment_459343" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T06:50:59+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  6:50AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts are: any description of a system in which advertising's cost to the end user is rendered invisible, and which simultaneous runs on advertising/marketing revenue, has some serious flaws. <br/>Access to radio, access to Facebook, access to broadcast television -- these are not and have never been free.

We can imagine an alternate world, and perhaps we can claim that copyright has been a powerful money-making machine for the arts, but there is a degree of uncertain speculation in any counterfactual comparison like this.<br/><br/>However, let's say that you are right and copyright has caused a) lots of money to flow into the arts over the 20th century, and b) that money has gone into improving quality and availability of art. The natural question to ask next is whether this has been a good investment. Note that the money allocated to this could have been spent elsewhere. This is just another form of "artists deserve to be paid", as far as I can see: how do we know that they do? What if the thing we would have bought instead of <i>Fox and Hound</i> would have been totally amazing? I want to say cure for cancer, but of course I'm no more able to say what it would have been like without copyright.<br/><br/>All that is, however, secondary to the true issue: we are not actually discussing the benefits of copyright, but rather whether copyright is <i>possible</i> at all in the current world. If it was just a question of balancing two reasonably functional alternative societal arrangements, then we could indeed speculate about the benefits of free information vs. the advantages of commercialization. However, that's not the choice that history is presenting us - that choice was available a hundred years ago, when copyright came to the fore as an institution, and at that time choosing copyright perhaps served society well; mediums for <i>copying</i> art were expensive, there was no such thing as casual non-commercial copying, and commercial piracy has always been something that can be controlled easily. The system worked for the 20th century. This is not, however, 20th century.<br/><br/>In the modern situation we are literally choosing between arbitrary repression and and freedom of information. The freedom of information was sort of enticing even in the 20th century (I think I would agree with you if you said that it was not as enticing as the commercial order brought on by copyright - in hindsight the public school and library system proved capable of building up an egalitarian civil society, at least here in Finland, despite the existence of copyright), but now that having copyright means giving up on that <i>plus</i> building up a repressive system capable of enforcing copyright, it doesn't appeal to me anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459346/#Comment_459346" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T09:48:42+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  9:48AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me tell you a timely story here about my father - the following illustrates the direction of copyright enforcement pretty well, I think:<br/><br/>A couple of weeks ago my father got an official-seeming letter from a corporation called "Adultia". The letter said that this corporation has been tracking my father's Internet use by IP, and that he has flouted the copyright of one of their clients by Bittorrenting a certain movie last spring, in March. The movie's name is apparently "Don't Tell My Wife that I Assfucked the Babysitter 16". Adultia demands a compensation of was it 600 \u20ac I think for this supposed infringement. The letter was written in a quite threatening, slimy tone, with references to the Finnish market court's "recent decisions on copyright issues", supposedly backing their demands.<br/><br/>Now, that name was sort of familiar, but I needed to check: Adultia is indeed one of two or three recently formed Finnish copyright inquisition organizations. This particular one specializes in adult film industry. I can only imagine how it can be both reasonably effective as blackmail, and socially devastating for Finnish families, when they send tens of thousands of these letters (this is not speculation; that is, in fact, precisely what they do) with flimsy evidence to all but random people, accusing them not only of piracy (which, who cares morally speaking - 65% of Finns do it), but also of watching pornography (which may or may not be a big deal to spouses and such, as you might imagine). I understand that the business goes pretty well for Adultia: they have never, ever taken a single one of these blackmail attempts to court, but the country's full of technologically illiterate, morally scared people who are surely willing to pay when asked to.<br/><br/>In case you're wondering about the methodology behind targeting these letters, it is I think familiar from the USA - I understand that the jurisprudential techniques involved here originate in the US, and the Finnish companies involved in this new business certainly have their owners and connections in Germany, UK and US. The copyright watchdog corporation signs on a bunch of clients who own popular copyrights (in the case of Adultia a bunch of adult film companies). After that, they start watching the Bittorrent distribution of certain flagship titles they judge to be a particularly effective use of their time; they might even seed them themselves, I hear. Bittorrent technology, generally speaking, reveals the IP addresses that participate in distributing a given torrent, so the company now has a long list of IP addresses. Next they go to market court to get an injunction against the service provider in control of said IPs, forcing them to provide the corporation with a list of their customers associated with those IP addresses in the time-frames indicated. Finally, when they have this list of future marks, they send out their letters to people about whom they are somewhat certain (within the technological certainties of this process - we can go into more detail on that if somebody doesn't know) that they might have participated in torrenting their product.<br/><br/>(The reason for why the actual cases are not really court-worthy in Finland, but rather only blackmail-worthy, is that you cannot convict a person here for a crime supposedly performed at a IP address under their control unless you can also prove that the person in question did the deed. The copyright inquisition does not usually have the means to prove that somebody was the only user of that IP in that time-frame, and that their computer was not infested by some hypothetical malware that could have been responsible for the false positive. Meanwhile, the defendant should be able to prove to the satisfaction of the market court that they have family or friends using the same IP and that they do not have any Bittorrent software, and so on. Of course this does not matter as long as you get a victim willing to pay the hush money.)<br/><br/>So as to contextualize this story of what the future of copyright enforcement looks like: my father does not read or speak English; he does not know what Bittorrent is; his Internet connection is a mobile broadband modem, a technology notorious for sharing and switching up the IP address at the whim of the service provider. He tells me that he hasn't downloaded that movie with Bittorrent, and I am inclined to believe him, but you make up your own minds.<br/><br/>Now, cultures differ, so I won't try to tell you what you should think about this kind of new, delightful, entirely legal form of extortion raising its head in society. I will say that I'm sorry for every victim, and not just my own father; he's a tough old coot, familiar with various sorts of scam mail from his working days, so not likely to lose his sleep for something like this. Others may get much, much more afraid and worried about this, whether guilty of the claimed deed or not. I can only imagine what hell it is for families where somebody gets to try to convince their significant others about how they don't watch cheating porn on the sly, as claimed by this nice letter that came in the SOs name.<br/><br/>I hope that the barb of this story is clear: I am claiming that this is merely the first type of invasive, morally slimy yet entirely legal initiative that copyright law will empower in the coming decades if we as a society continue equating digital piracy with real crime. It's totally opaque to me what's going to happen next: maybe the copyright mob gets some new laws, or a high court decision brings in a new interpretation of the old ones, and suddenly they'll have a <i>court-effective</i> means to accuse people. Perhaps they'll get a new standard that enables impounding computer hardware on mere suspicion, like the police already does in certain related high-profile distribution cases. Maybe Intel's and Microsoft's new initiatives for copyright-bonded hardware gain legislative support, so as to finally get real enforcement measures into people's homes. I do not know what the next step is supposed to be, because this is still sort of child's play right here, and doesn't really do anything to turn the tide on digital piracy, even if it is a lucrative living for a bunch of lawyers willing to make theirs by terrorizing random citizens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459347/#Comment_459347" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T09:49:14+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  9:49AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2017 9:55AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thus: I'm not against copyright as a historical phenomenon (at most I'm undecided), but I am honestly clueless as to how we could continue demanding enforcement <i>without</i> essentially striking a killing blow against traditional liberties of the civil society. (If I was American, this would probably be where I'd quote your constitution.) And if we do not figure out a realistic way to enforce this law, it will become one of those vile selectively-enforced dead letters that nobody respects and everybody flouts, yet the ruling class can use it at will to pile on some charges when they feel like pinning something on you. Who liked the mid-century era when everybody sort of accepted that gays had human rights, but you could still get dragged into court and a mental asylum about it if you got too uppity? That's what it's going to be like if we simultaneously fail to effectively enforce copyright, yet give free rein to corporate copyright inquisitions to selectively milk people for hush money.<br/><br/>Note that I am not arguing that respecting copyright is wrong; I'm merely arguing that trying to uphold copyright as a public moral standard is probably a little bit wrong, because every time you e.g. shame somebody else for piracy, you're also helping to maintain a shaky societal consensus about piracy being wrong. It's just like the gays example in many ways: you don't need to be gay yourself, but every time you preach about the dubiousness of gayness in public, you are doing your part to uphold the traditional anti-gay values. This is of course a fine thing to do if you believe that piracy is evil and pirates get what they deserve in scenarios such as the above. However, if you believe, as I do, that current non-commercial pirates are merely doing what comes naturally, contributing to a new sharing society, and living their lives (albeit under a new, different moral code as regards artist's rights), then the copyright inquisition starts looking more and more like an error of history that we will come to regret even in our own lifetimes. I do not want to be party to fining, jailing and debt-enserfing people who might merely be a bit in advance of the general society in figuring out how the future of digital culture is going to look like.<br/><br/>Needless to say, my own personal commitment to <i>not</i> suing anybody for non-commercial infringement of my commercial copyrights arises out of the ambivalent societal situation we live in: the technology has already proven impossible to stop, yet the laws are still in the books, and it's still possible for people to rake each other over on all kinds of hot coals over these new practices - not the least the court of public opinion, I think it's disgusting how willing self-righteous bourgeoisie can be about condemning other people's piracy. I don't want to have any part in that, not until somebody comes up with a new kind of copyright enforcement that actually makes piracy nonviable without horribly unbalanced repressive measures.\n<blockquote><br/>It's not hard to what would happen if our dear Jeff suddenly become a billionaire. Perhaps he would offer to pay $1,000,000 (or some other hefty sum in your preferred currency) to the best 10 games anyone could produce for his game club. This would create a revolution in game design, playtesting, online discussion, and, likely, evolution in gaming practices.</blockquote>\nNot to be a wet blanket, but surely this would just give rise to a showy reality tv-show about supposed big-name designers competing for an award. If true art could be brought into being that simply, every triple-A video game and Hollywood blockbuster would be true art.<br/><br/>I get your point about how money can get things done, but it's not so obvious that it's an efficacious motivator, and that it motivates the right things. Wouldn't it be interesting if we could visit an alternative 18th century world in which effective copyright already exists, and we found out that the progress of arts was actually pretty much the same as it was historically, because ultimately the lack of copyright wasn't <i>that</i> important? Maybe the only difference would be that they'd have like 150 ersatz clones of Robinson Crusoe (the novel) instead of merely 50, because copyright encouraged a wider extent of commercialization in art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459348/#Comment_459348" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T09:49:57+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  9:49AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is, in a sense, what happens when copyright is enforceable on a certain medium. When a creator has a sense of security in her product become monetizable, she is able to leverage a whole other level of commitment to excellence.</blockquote>\nI feel like my point about civic liberties and infeasibility of enforcing copyright trumps your point about its positives - let me know if you disagree. This is to say, I do not necessarily disagree about the causality you posit, but I think it's irrelevant because the negatives of copyright enforcement have grown much bigger even than this invigorating effect it has on arts.<br/><br/>The one thing I just want everybody to remember about this is that you really, really, honestly don't know if this investment of capital into the culture industry is actually a good investment. You say it like the copyright thing is a good thing because it funnels money into arts and enables artists to work on it for a living, but that argument comes from the heart and not the head: what if it was the case that these artists would do other beautiful and excellent things for us in some other occupations, as all money that is currently spent on going to the movies and buying music was instead spent on other things? Who' to say that we're the winner world between these alternative realities? Is it you, just because you liked the latest Star Wars movie?<br/><br/>I don't feel a need to hold an opinion on whether the culture industry as it currently stands is over-capitalized, but I do know that I value a liberal civil rights society more than I do capitalization of the culture industry. If the price for society in disempowering the copyright inquisition is to go into a somewhat more humble and constrained culture industry, one funded in different ways from now, then I'm willing to go for it, and I think others should be as well.\n<blockquote>Sure, art and craft will always be around. We'll always have people playing instruments, competing in sports, making paintings, and (hopefully, but less certainly) designing story games.</blockquote>\nEh, out of all of these story games are the one thing where we pretty much can be certain that it's going to be just fine without copyright. Most of us make pennies on this hobby, and the rest could tap their established fan market just as well with ransom model or subscription service models. If all copyright laws were repealed today, I expect that hardly anything would change for this particular facet of the culture industry <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>I'm not sure where that leaves us, but it could explain Jeff's attitude here - as you point out, saying that "creators deserve to be paid for their work" is a somewhat self-defeating statement from a logical standpoint, but as a sort of voluntary moral stance, it makes total sense. In theory, we could agree to support a certain form of art financially, and if enough of us do so, the whole level of the artform rises up, evolves, develops. </blockquote>\nI think that this is an excellent stance for people to take in the brave new world. It is the stance of a <b>patron of the arts</b>. Just drop that outdated idea that you need to pay for the art in one-on-one exchanges of money for product, and start patronizing artists directly, and I promise you neither of you will want to go back to paying for products. (The artist would probably like the money from all those people who don't want to become his patrons, too, but that's tought luck for him - as I've described, I'm not going to totalitarize society just to save his traditional income source.)<br/><br/>In fact, feel free to patronize me, I'm available. Give me money and watch me dance. I'm really clever and I do all kinds of tricks when properly motivated. I'll make all your artistic ambitions come true in a vicarious way, all without needing to bother with copyright. (Just in case anyone of you was under the impression that you couldn't motivate me to work on your favourite gaming project - you thought wrong, just make an offer and we'll see if there's mutual creative grounds in there. Could be, I'm disgustingly curious about all sorts of things.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459349/#Comment_459349" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T09:50:10+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  9:50AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not sure what the answers are - and I do like seeing the success of crowdfunding platforms for games, even if it leaves less serious designers like myself in the dust - but I will mention that there may be other possible outcomes than the two extremes you posit (either a tyrannical police state or total piracy).</blockquote>\nI am totally into speculating about alternate paths to the future. Anybody want to start? You could single-handedly win me back into the copyright fold by armchairing up a roadmap into a future that does not have the problems I outlined earlier.<br/><br/>The key concern for me is that the siren song of free culture is going to keep enticing the poor and the dispossessed: it is a human need, and a noble one at that, to partake in civilization, and entertainment corporations can try, but they cannot really convince us that culture is just a frivolous privilege and not a right. So that's a thing, some sort of a library institution is probably going to have to be part of any non-dystopian future - at least here in Finland it would be completely inconceivable (as in, I wouldn't be the only one going militant at something like this) to suggest that in the future we shall be breeding subliterate underclasses by constraining access to information.<br/><br/>So even if the middle classes can be swayed by moral arguments to not pirate because it's not part of the social contract, and because it can get slightly cumbersome with current means of prevention (like, right now piracy is so difficult that Netflix is <i>almost</i> as easy), I don't think that the moral argument will hold water for the less fortunate, and I don't think it <i>should</i>, being the dirty Nordic socialist that I am.<br/><br/>So if moral arguments do not work, what about judicial punishment? That could conceivably work if privacy in the Internet was removed by illegalizing it (sounds like the police state again), <i>and</i> the crowd immunity of pirates was somehow pared down - right now it is inconceivable to enact an effective legal ban on a practice enjoyed by a majority of the population. It would be easier to ban alcohol in Finland (tried that in the '30s, didn't work) than piracy, as things stand.<br/><br/>Technological solutions? If you're willing to illegalize the sale and use of non-conforming equipment, then sure - the technology exists for building machines that are practically unable to process any except properly licensed datastreams. You <i>will</i> be relinquishing complete conceptual control over everybody's digital life to whoever builds the machines, which would count as the police state scenario for me, but I think this has a chance of working. Societies like China <i>do</i> in real life have feasible means of stopping digital piracy within their borders, thanks to a massively funded secret police organization and the societal will to use it - interestingly not for curbing piracy, it seems, but they're doing a pretty good job about curbing the Tiananmen massacre and such <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>For example, many countries collect a tax which they then redistribute to artists according to the impact of their work.</blockquote>\nThis solution can live side by side with piracy. It's one of the many alternate funding models that need to be matured into serious business use side-by-side with legalization of piracy (or more properly, non-commercial digital sharing; it's not piracy anymore when it's legal).<br/><br/>Finland has a whole bunch of these systems already in place. I don't think that public funding is good as the only solution (deciding who gets the money gets too difficult) for arts, but it's a fair supplement to incomes - same argument as with citizen wages, basically. Finnish authors get money for library use of their books, musicians get money for radio play, and so on - the idea exists, and works to some degree. We used to have a a special sales tax for distribution mediums - cassettes, hard drives, blank CDs, etc. - that was apportioned to the culture industry to compensate for private copying (which remains legal in Finland); the tax was removed in 2015, but the practice of compensation remains, now funded directly from the state budget.\n<blockquote>I'd love to hear your* thoughts on all this. My ideas here are fairly idle thought, not terribly well considered; I'm just brainstorming a little on the topic, based on some basic knowledge.</blockquote>\nOh, you rascal, you've clearly read a book about the topic <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>But people sometimes want to pay me to write new pieces for some specific purpose. And in those cases they do offer me a decent chunk of change. The reason why is obvious: if they don't, or if they offer me a pittance, the piece isn't going to get written! Whereas with things that are already out there, it's much harder for the artist to control remuneration.</blockquote>\nExactly what I'm saying. This is totally a practical issue for me. I was undecided on this matter for like a decade from mid-'90s on despite living the issue like any Nordic teenager. A couple of years of actually working in culture industry, combined with some hard thinking about practical ways of preventing piracy, finally convinced me about my current stance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459362/#Comment_459362" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T18:01:14+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  6:01PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I can see that you feel very strongly about this issue, and with good reasons. I respect that, and the amount of thought you've given to the issue. However, I'm also sensing a bit of an adversarial tone from you which baffles me (as far as I know, we're on the same side of the debate, so to speak). Perhaps you can explain where we aren't in agreement? I'm feeling like either I didn't express my point very well, or I'm missing yours.<br/><br/>Perhaps a quick summary of my thoughts here will help:<br/><br/>* I am in *complete* agreement with you on the infeasibility of controlling "piracy". It's going to keep happening, with the availability of digital media spreading to all corners of the world.<br/><br/>* Furthermore, any methods involved in controlling this kind of access to information sound draconian and unethical. If we could come up with a way of limiting access to art media... I probably would be strongly against it. (At least, I can't imagine an ethical way of doing so which doesn't end up hurting people in a disadvantaged position disproportionately.)<br/><br/>* Overall, I'd prefer to see a future where free access to information is the norm, and encouraged.<br/><br/>* Pre-digital efforts to make access to information publicly available (like public libraries), I think, were clearly a good for society, and especially helpful to people in a disadvantaged position (e.g. poverty). This seems to me to be a strong argument for keeping such possibilities around as much as possible - the advantages of free access to information outweigh the negatives in almost every instance I can imagine.<br/><br/>For instance, your example of the blackmail scam in Finland is horrific, I agree. (I do not hesitate to call it a "scam", even though it sounds like it's technically legal, because that's clearly what it is. It wouldn't be the first legal scam, in any case!)<br/><br/>That's my basic position. So, what was I trying to add to this discussion?<br/><br/>* I disagree with your assumption that total, free piracy for all and some form of draconian repression are the only possibilities. <br/><br/>I think that renumeration for creators is possible without a repressive regime, and we should try hard to think of new methods to do so. We just have to get clever about it.<br/><br/>You've brought up a number of such methods yourself in your post (like the various media taxes in Finland). They are not perfect, but they DO provide income streams for creators without restricting access to the resulting products. Public libraries could still buy books from authors to put on their shelves, even if the books can be pirated online (much like Jeff is doing for his club), for examples. (Yes, I don't think public libraries will last too much longer, but it's an example that's worked up until now.)<br/><br/>* I think there is strong evidence that copyright protection (or, rather, the side-effect of expected renumeration for work - it doesn't *have* to be enabled through copyright protection, if a better way can be found) has strong effects on art fields, in general. <br/><br/>Again, I'm not an expert on the subject, but I've spoken to a number of such experts, and they have shown me a number of very convincing examples. <br/><br/>For instance, Canada changed its legal approach to how the country creates funds and support for musicians drastically about 40 years ago. There are, of course, drawbacks to the laws, but the arts scene was transformed drastically. The country went from being one where few artists were known anywhere to a real powerhouse. (For instance, at one point last year, of the 10 top hits in North America, 7 were by Canadian artists.)<br/><br/>Similar effects have been seen in other countries. Fairly reliably, countries with laws which support independent creators (including most of the Nordic countries, like Finland) are over-represented internationally (relative to their size/population). This goes both for popular media and for artistic credibility, by the way - as far as I can see, giving artists an opportunity to work certainly produces lots of garbage (and some of it achieves great popular success, e.g. Star Wars), but encourages truly interesting, innovative, and quality art, as well (proportionately).<br/><br/>Again, I can't say to be an expert on this, nor do I have sources. But experts I've spoken to don't seem to see this is a controversial point - examples abound.<br/><br/>I don't think this is entirely coincidental or imaginary. When I look at how much the quality of independently-published RPGs has risen since the advent of print-on-demand, crowdfunding, and other technologies, I really doubt it's a total coincidence. <br/><br/>This isn't because people are only motivated by money. I might want to publish a game of my own, and go ahead and do so no matter what. However, if the environment exists for me to have some expectation of a financial return on that, I can afford to hire a layour editor, pay someone for some nice art, maybe increase the quality of the print product, etc... the final result is quite different. When you see this reliably across a field, the effects are very powerful.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459363/#Comment_459363" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T18:05:50+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  6:05PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But people sometimes want to pay me to write new pieces for some specific purpose.

But there are means of providing income for work without limiting access to that product. Advertising has its own "evil", its own costs on society, which I don't love, but it's an example.<br/><br/>For instance, let's imagine that 5-10 years from now, people no longer use game texts - instead, all the materials you need to play are made in video form. (Perhaps we've forgotten to read altogether! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>A website like YouTube can host these videos, and provide money based on views by also hosting advertising. You go and post your game tutorial videos there for free, and anyone can go watch them for free. It's freely accessible information. However, you can still expect some revenue, particularly if your game is really, really good, or really, really popular. (Sadly, I don't think human beings have thought of any way to distinguish the two, when it comes to consumption...)<br/><br/>A person might host their own copy and "pirate" the information this way, but enough people would be too lazy to do so and head over to YouTube instead.<br/><br/>The "hidden cost", of course, is advertising, which is not great. But it's far better than a hypothetical totalitarian regime Big Brother, or draconian software laws.<br/><br/>Now, the idea of game texts as videos might seem far-fetched. However, I think it's not unreasonable to expect that local storage of files and information will soon be a thing of the past - everything will be "in the cloud", for you to access on a small portable device when you need it. If information is being accessed remotely or streamed, it's not that hard to track how often this happens, and work out a way to use that to redistribute some money to the creator without draconian legal measures.<br/><br/>You have a website like Google Documents, where you upload your game text/video/app, for free, and people access it for free. It's not difficult to track this, without invasive measures (for instance, like with YouTube, we don't need to know WHO is accessing the information). But if a million people access your game draft, maybe advertising companies or Google or tax money pays you some relative share. I don't think it's utterly far-fetched. And the future will likely bring more interesting ways of doing this kind of thing. <br/><br/>(Perhaps being a successful publisher means you can shop at my store, and I get to claim you as a customer, which improves my "popularity" rating, so I get to offer you a discount, or some other weird future world dynamic we can't imagine yet.)<br/><br/>I think it's worth thinking about: certainly governments do think about it. Relatively few governments really care about art, of course, but the ones who do (like Canada and Finland) have seen some pretty powerful effects, and those countries tend to be over-represented internationally in terms of their artistic output (both in quantity and quality, I should note).<br/><br/>* Your other question is: is it necessarily a public good to support art, instead of other endeavours? Does spending tax money on cultural matters means we're less likely to create a cure for cancer?<br/><br/>This, to me, IS a truly hypothetical question. I have no idea how to answer it, really. I doubt there is an objective answer, or one we would agree on. I do know, however, that a LOT of people worldwide value art enough to answer this with a strong "yes". <br/><br/>I do know, also, that artistic and cultural developments often have unexpected benefits in other fields. For instance, my mother and stepfather both work in Urban Planning. They often see municipal governments trying to cut funding to "unessential" things like culture, art, and green spaces (e.g. parks), on the basis that they aren't as important as infrastructure, security, industry, and so on. <br/><br/>While they themselves have no particular stake in art, green spaces, or cultural values, they say that all the research available in the Planning field shows that money put into those areas is actually money extremely well-spent. For instance, building good public transit, making nice parks, and supporting cultural events like music festivals or art galleries increases property values, bringing in wealth, business, tourism, and encouraging investors. They say that a purely money-motivated culture- and art-hating government, which does not value such things intrinsically, should <i>still</i> invest in such fields because of the benefits to the city, its growth, and its business. Neighbourhoods with nice parks, for example, attract developers, businesses, wealth, and increase the prosperity of the city overall, by any measure.<br/><br/>So, the value of art and culture can be hard to gauge, due to a variety of indirect effects.<br/><br/>Is there any evidence that providing less support to artistic endeavours leads to more scientific advnaces, for instance? I don't know. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459366/#Comment_459366" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T18:33:20+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  6:33PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can see that you feel very strongly about this issue, and with good reasons. I respect that, and the amount of thought you've given to the issue. However, I'm also sensing a bit of an adversarial tone from you which baffles me (as far as I know, we're on the same side of the debate, so to speak). Perhaps you can explain where we aren't in agreement? I'm feeling like either I didn't express my point very well, or I'm missing yours.</blockquote>\nI'm sorry if the tone was off - I did not intend to sound angry, I just rolled out my argument quickly so I could get on with other things. Mainly it was about explaining why you cannot justify copyright by the good it does, when its negative effects are on the rise. There may be some rhetorical flourishes in there, but they're not directed at you specifically. Just some pointed questions for everybody to think over.<br/><br/>It is true that I have my opinions on this matter, but I'm not being emotional about it. Please do not read with that assumption. Rather, imagine me being an excited wiseass at a house party, sermonizing about a favoured topic.<br/><br/>To clarify my position on the future of the industry: I am not in any way against renumerating creators. I just did not open the discussion with that, because that wasn't the question (we started from the justifications of piracy). It is true that I give civic liberties a higher priority than the economic arrangements of a frankly marginal occupation group, but insofar as we can maintain old culture industry and invent new methods while moving to the digital age, of course I support that. I personally am not afraid of a copyright-less future, and I am speaking as somebody whose livelihood comes from this very same industry; there are plenty of strategies to adapt, and it's not like the shift away from traditional product sales is occurring so fast that one couldn't keep up. There's plenty of time for anybody willing to change at all to reinvent their business models (excepting perhaps IP investment houses - those have lost, and will continue losing real value as the IP rights they hold become less relevant).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459367/#Comment_459367" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T18:36:40+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  6:36PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an interesting side-point:<br/><br/>I occasionally work with a man who is involved (at a very high level) in copyright law, music, and developing technology. He spent several years in China as part of a group of consultants, and played a role in the change in attitude towards copyrights there. The Chinese don't have a strong sense of intellectual property, culturally, so it's a foreign concept to them. However, discussing the financial benefits of copyright with this group of consultants has led to some changes over the last 5 years or so, and they've started instituting various copyright protection laws. <br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, these changes have led to an incredible explosion in the Chinese cinema world, likely strong enough to dwarf Hollywood in the near future. It is now possible to make big money in film for the first time, so instead of a few independent, low-budget productions, new investors are constantly jumping in, and the bar keeps rising.<br/><br/>He was also involved in developing software which could track use of digital media on people's computers. Basically, it's designed to collect data on what media is used most often - for instance, it could report that this video was played 1,500 times, and this PDF was opened 750 times in a certain city. The idea is that the data could then be used to redistribute funds to creators (right now, laws exist in China to pay creators for the use of their content, but the companies refuse to pay the creators on the grounds that they can't *prove* how often their work was accessed, so the tax money just gets pocketed by the internet providers).<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is amusing or horrific, but so far the Chinese government has turned down the software on the basis that it was *anonymous*. <br/><br/>You see, they want a version which lets them know who is doing what on their computer, not the encrypted and anonymized data collection this team was offering. Yikes! Scary stuff, of course. Very scary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459371/#Comment_459371" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-17T20:18:13+00:00" title="January 17, 2017  8:18PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now I have pulled the new WTWE from the market, because an improved version  is coming.

For example, I purchased WTWE in PDF form, and if you ever come out with a new book form (which I hope your still at least debating) will purchase that. If not I will purchase a used copy of the original book if possible. This situation does not apply to an author pausing production to make another printing. So I just wanted to clarify that this is a very different situation I'm pondering.

So the question is which resources are consumers <i>really</i> after, and what makes them difficult to attain?<br/><br/>For example, Information currently has <i>negative</i> value and real costs in time (and sometimes even health) to deal with.

There are people involved who simply profit out of the free culture apparatus (mainly by advertising income from high-profile websites), but they're rarely directly involved in the procurement, packaging and distribution of content. What drives the actual people who distribute and receive copyright-infringing art?<br/><br/>The indigenous explanation among pirates is generally extremely naturalistic, and usually taken for granted to such a degree that it's rarely discussed: you pirate on a case by case basis because you are interested in this or that, and it's an affordable and straightforward way to indulge. If you get into it more seriously, packaging and distributing for others, that's because you perceive yourself as a cultural curator, particularly able to provide others with access to the good stuff. Or, you might simply feel a desire to contribute to the community by giving back. Often it seems to be a way to associate yourself with some particular work that you especially appreciate; for example, the people who scan, translate and republish Japanese comics seem to generally be motivated by the acclaim of other fans and their own appreciation of the work they're translating.<br/><br/>The external explanation one generally hears is that pirates are ignorant and selfish teenagers who don't care about other people's livelihoods. I can totally see how this would describe a part of the demographic in the receiving end, but much of the curatory work in the upstream seems too involved for children, so clearly there's more to it than that. The likeliest explanation is that there are all sorts of people involved, from all age brackets (particularly under 40 or so, as those are the people who've grown up in a digitalizing world).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459494/#Comment_459494" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-22T13:34:22+00:00" title="January 22, 2017  1:34PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've heard some people have great success with "pay what you want" models, however.

I mean, I would've thought that you'd consider copyright similar to say traffic ordinances - that's what it looks like to me. The moral issue is not that copyright itself has some sort of universal moral validity (if it did, we would have to conclude that nearly the entire history of mankind has been spent living in sin regarding this one thing), but rather that flouting copyright is illegal, and breaking the law may be morally wrong due to how it is a refusal to live according to the society's rules.<br/><br/>Saying that copyright is an individual moral issue regardless of the law implies that flouting copyright would be wrong even if society accepted it, or if the owner of the copyright did not demand compliance. That sounds pretty zany to my moral sensibilities. In fact, it sounds to me like the library system is necessarily immoral, if that is the case - the only way in which libraries do not infringe on copyright is in the moral sense (and in the trivial technical sense, in that they do not "copy" books, but rather merely loan them out). Librarians are the worst of all, having rationalized it to themselves to take wages from the public to engage in this immoral practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459580/#Comment_459580" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-25T10:59:59+00:00" title="January 25, 2017 10:59AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really interesting viewpoint. <br/><br/>Is copyright infringement a flouting of a law you don't like (in which case, as Eero says, libraries are the worst form of this evil)?<br/><br/>Or is copyright protection a sort of basic human right, in the same way that theft is something most people would consider fundamentally wrong? ("Thou shall not steal...")<br/><br/>The presence of easy-to-copy media (e.g. digital media) is a new development in human civilization, and it seems like we haven't quite figured out where our moral lines lie in relation to it. (Although the copying of books is somewhat similar, in spirit.)<br/><br/>It seemed clear that when physical art only existed in discrete, physical pieces (a painting, a book, etc.), taking it against the owner's wishes would be a form of theft. But when you can take a copy without taking away the original copy... it's much less obvious where the creator's rights lie, if anywhere at all.<br/><br/>If I create something, and make it available, the moral distinction is not at all clear. But if I create something, then give a copy to a few trusted friends, and tell them not to show it to anyone... if that product now ends up in public circulation, can we argue that it is moral to share it further?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459581/#Comment_459581" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-25T11:40:45+00:00" title="January 25, 2017 11:40AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Side note: I miss having a roleplaying equivalent to Netflix; tons of games online and I pay every month to get access to it.<br/></blockquote>\nHmmm...

However, if copyright infringement is an intrinsic moral evil, then surely mere human law cannot grant an exception to libraries? And surely the fact that a library merely loans you something instead of giving it to you is not relevant to the moral point: the artist has lost their control over the distribution of their work just the same whether we're borrowing on an industrial scale (really, libraries do little <i>but</i> invent new, more efficient ways of distributing other people's copyrighted works without outright copying them) or copying, right?<br/><br/>To me this reductio ad absurdum about libraries intuitively suggests that non-commercial copying is not a moral evil. If it were, then libraries should be evil as well, and I don't have any sense that they are.

I would argue that the original distribution decision by your friends was wrong as a breach of trust - so a social wrong, in that they were being unfaithful friends. Meanwhile, the people further in the copying chain cannot be held responsible for the original stain, I think, as they have no social obligation to you, and they do not even necessarily know about the original circumstances.<br/><br/>One could argue that all piracy originates in a similar breach of trust, but I do not think that this is the case: most works of art that are made publicly available are sold with no bonds of friendship nor loyalty implied. Even usage licenses are not generally taken as a matter of honor, but rather merely as legal ploys. Thus I would find it far-fetched to argue that piracy in general is a matter of honor, even as trust between friends is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459587/#Comment_459587" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-25T16:23:43+00:00" title="January 25, 2017  4:23PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2017 4:27PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All I would say is at the very least, try to check with the publisher and do your due diligence to see if the product is available somewhere.

And that it's in fact <i>immoral</i> when "intellectual property" laws end up working against the stated moral goal: a perversion of the original spirit of the law, or a clear abuse.<br/><br/>So, wait... in fact I do agree that it's a moral issue! Copyright laws as they currently exist have become corrupt and immoral, and the kind of blackmail Eero reports is just a piece of evidence amongst many.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459623/#Comment_459623" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T10:31:51+00:00" title="January 26, 2017 10:31AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's because the concept of copyright first arose in a context in which reverting to public domain was the default expectation, and what you call the moral outlook was the common one.  Now that things have flipped to a context in which corporate IP acquisitions are worth millions and have been protected by extending the duration and definition of copyright further and further, it has become perverted.

If I like it, chances are I may even buy it again, and I spend far too much money on kickstarter, mainly due to my desire to own a copy of every PBtA game.<br/>I feel copyright is unenforcable, no matter the harshness of the punishment (France had a death penalty for copying a certain cloth pattern a few centuries ago. Didn't work), especially digitally. If I've discovered something awesome, I want to share it with my friends. When it comes to shows, I'll share. When it comes to games, I'll GM.<br/><br/>Where the argument for copyright promoting the arts becomes weak is when culture is allowed to rot because it's not re-printed but copyright is for life of author +70 years.<br/><br/>As for wanting a service akin to netflix for games, try asking your local librarian.

Results in them buying their own favourite games, or nothing at all if they're not hobbyists.<br/><br/>This would logically speaking end up with the games section filled up with d20 supplements (or whatever the current favourite du jour of the mainstream is) at the egging of eager players of said game, except librarians actually seem to be professionals in the field of, well, running libraries, so they seem generally resistant to splurging the entire rpg budget into a complete collection of sourcebooks for a single game.<br/><br/>Can't complain about the end result, really; I don't use the library rpg collection myself (like most adults, it's easier to buy my own copies of reference books like that), but if I did, I'm pretty confident that I'd have access to the keystone works in the rpg field that way as well. I remember how important the library access was when I was a teenager - about half of all the games we played then were library copies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459637/#Comment_459637" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T20:51:21+00:00" title="January 26, 2017  8:51PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2017 8:53PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero said:<br/>"I disagree about authors deserving to be paid for their work.

It's enough for it to have *some* impact on the field, in order to provide support to artists. This is not too different from Hasimir's position on his own games, in many ways.<br/><br/>I like the idea of establishing more means of distribution which provide income to artists *without* limiting access to the products (like radio play, YouTube funding through advertising, and some of the social programs in Nordic countries, like Eero discusses earlier in the thread). That seems like a great compromise.<br/><br/>Long-term, corporate-owned intellectual property rights do seem fairly abusive.

This is not too different from Hasimir's position on his own games, in many ways.</blockquote>\nSelective enforcement is not a good idea societally, because it makes judicial blackmail an option - exactly like the Adultia letters I mentioned earlier. When everybody's guilty, or near enough, the law becomes a weapon against the weak of society. The powerful men are never accosted for things that everybody does like piracy or lewdness, while the laws remain on the books as an effective terror tool in cross-class power exchanges. In this case the law happens to favour computer-literate and law-literate people quite heavily (those are the ones who can defend themselves against claims), while people afraid for their reputations and uncertain about their rights end up paying the extortioner or losing the legal case.<br/><br/>That aside, though, I understand the gist of that idea; if copyright could be just efficient enough, it would be OK for it to be somewhat weaker than it is now. So at least for the non-corporate defenders of copyright there is room for compromise.<br/><br/>As it happens, I think that the legalization of non-commercial copying is actually one such compromise. I mean, the various pirate parties of European politics <i>could</i> be demanding the complete abolishment of copyright law, but that doesn't seem to be the general demand. Instead, what they (we, I guess I should say) demand is legalizing non-commercial digital distribution - essentially, to stop hunting private individuals engaging in non-profit cultural activities. This would still retain a large sphere of cultural industry for exclusive commercial exploitation, as commercial pirate products would remain as illegal as ever.<br/><br/>(For those who track my earlier argument about piracy having to be legalized because enforcing the laws against it is impossible, you might be wondering why I seem to be in favour of retaining legal limitations for commercial piracy. The reason is simple: unlike with non-commercial piracy, I still retain faith that it is somewhat possible to effectively police commercial piracy. Money leaves tracks, and is ultimately spent in society, and all in all it is no more difficult to police commercial pirates than it is to watch out for illegal drug sales, tax evasion or human trafficking. Difficult, sure, but not outright <i>ludicrous</i> in a technical sense. Easy enough that I'm willing to try, still.)<br/><br/>Aside from that, it seems to me that if there was willingness, copyright could be moderated in all sorts of ways. As a student of history I suspect that this is one of those things where a revolution is largely brought on by the inflexibility, greed and blindness of the current ruling elite: the culture industry as a whole is entrenched in defending copyright to such a degree that making significant concessions would be considered a defeat - as it would surely be for the owners of the largest IP portfolios. Thus, when compromise is made impossible, we might end up with the entire system getting discredited over time.<br/><br/>As an example of a compromise that would be fully within historical precedent, imagine if the mandatory licensing scheme from the radio medium was generalized over all arts: anybody doing distribution has a subjective right to distribute any published work they want, but they are also obligated to keep records of what they distribute, and they pay a fixed fee (set by whomever, not so important here) for the privilege to a central organization that then takes care of distributing the money to artists.<br/><br/>The most significant features of the mandatory licensing scheme are that the licensing fee is low; that it is fixed; that it is mandatory (no opt-out for individual rights-holders). This basically makes a service akin to Netflix both immensely more powerful in terms of selection, and also much, much cheaper. It reduces the profits in certain media fields compared to current conventions in how they sell things, but it still retains the concept of copyright. It is a compromise, just like it was a compromise when radio play was facilitated by curtailing the copyright severely.<br/><br/>Heck, one could just have Internet providers cover the licensing fee for their customers, on the assumption that everybody does a little bit of distribution on the side. It'd be like the old cassette tax we used to have here in Finland. I've seen this suggested now and again, but of course it would be politically difficult to set a tax that officially condones piracy.<br/><br/>I can imagine how revamping copyright with something like mandatory licensing would cut the piracy movement at the knees, while still retaining a firm concept of copyright - or I guess it would be "payright" at that point, as you wouldn't have the right to set your price or refuse to sell anymore, once you'd made the initial decision to publish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459642/#Comment_459642" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-27T01:06:51+00:00" title="January 27, 2017  1:06AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2017 1:16AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>As an example of a compromise that would be fully within historical precedent, imagine if the mandatory licensing scheme from the radio medium was generalized over all arts: anybody doing distribution has a subjective right to distribute any published work they want, but they are also obligated to keep records of what they distribute, and they pay a fixed fee (set by whomever, not so important here) for the privilege to a central organization that then takes care of distributing the money to artists.<br/>[...]<br/>Heck, one could just have Internet providers cover the licensing fee for their customers, on the assumption that everybody does a little bit of distribution on the side.

Of course, with new technology emerging, it can even be done in more practical, direct, and measurable ways. So there may be room to improve on those older concepts substantially, as well.<br/><br/>It's exactly what I was trying to get at earlier: it's possible to have a system of flexible enforcement which doesn't limit distribution or creative freedom, but still allows creators to get compensated for their work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459643/#Comment_459643" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-27T02:00:35+00:00" title="January 27, 2017  2:00AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2017 2:01AM by AsIf.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make the entire industry one gigantic blockchain.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459654/#Comment_459654" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-27T16:41:59+00:00" title="January 27, 2017  4:41PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2017 12:47AM by Rickard.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Never mind.

Before that there was no such thing as public domain, and no need to enforce copyright.\n<blockquote>Personally, I've mainly pirated stuff such as TV-series because it was the only channel through which it was available.</blockquote>\nI know of several video services which stream broadcast TV shows they don't have rights to with ads so invasive they make watching the shows impossible without adblock. <br/><br/>So how are they making their money?\n<blockquote>Selective enforcement is not a good idea societally, because it makes judicial blackmail an option - exactly like the Adultia letters I mentioned earlier. <b>When everybody's guilty, or near enough, the law becomes a weapon against the weak of society.</b> The powerful men are never accosted for things that everybody does like piracy or lewdness, while the laws remain on the books as an effective terror tool in cross-class power exchanges.</blockquote>\nHell. Yes.<br/><br/>And you're already seeing this on places like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Twitter&amp;Mode=like">#Twitter</a> which are under no obligation to equitably enforce their rules, so people like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Milo&amp;Mode=like">#Milo</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Sargon&amp;Mode=like">#Sargon</a> get banned while <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Trump&amp;Mode=like">#Trump</a> remains. And that's also why I think we need new speech laws regarding the internet, because if there isn't a legal reason to preserve everyone's speech <i>equally</i>, services will base their decisions on whatever is most commercially beneficial.\n<blockquote>In this case the law happens to favour computer-literate and law-literate people quite heavily (those are the ones who can defend themselves against claims), while people afraid for their reputations and uncertain about their rights end up paying the extortioner or losing the legal case.</blockquote>\nTell me about it. My entire career shifted to computer law because of that.<br/><br/>The biggest bullies I've ever met in my adult life have been lawyers, though moral busybodies come a close second.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20932/for-those-of-you-who-are-game-publishers-charge-for-your-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20932/for-those-of-you-who-are-game-publishers-charge-for-your-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20932/for-those-of-you-who-are-game-publishers-charge-for-your-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20932%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20932%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
