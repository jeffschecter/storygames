I'm just having a hard time pinning it down for myself.</blockquote>\nHans,<br/><br/>Biosphere will actually be built to replace or supplement a unit of high school honors biology. I intend to test it and other <i>story curricula</i> experimentally to look at comparative learning and retention sometime soonish.<br/><br/>The story is premised a lot like a Michael Crighton book, with a team of advanced scientists brought together because the world is in jeopardy. Bees and other key species have been dying off across the northern hemisphere, leading to the imminent destruction of entire ecologies. Equipped with a near-futuristic controlled terrarium, a <i>Biosphere</i>, and top-of-the-line multidisciplinary research labs, can the scientists recreate the path of life to discover what went wrong and how to fix it?<br/><br/>As in many Story Jam supplements, a deck of cards would accompany this one. This deck of cards might contain things like: locations, characters, items, questions. I haven't actually designed much of Biosphere yet (been working on Wizards' Tower, and Fiore dei Gateau since yesterday, lol).<br/><br/>But the idea is this: different players draw thee different cards, containing scientific concepts. Some of those concepts would automatically be explored through play, in which the player who knows the most about that subject is likely to "teach" a fair amount through story. The cards already have some info on them, too. Additionally, in an educational environment cards are (usually?) drawn the day before you use them, with the assignment that you go home and familiarize yourself with those concepts in preparation for the next Jam. That way, when you're voicing a scientist, you can present complex material like she would, in the science soundbites that authors like Crighton use constantly in their fiction.<br/><br/>The goal will be to engender that powerful environment of inspired teaching and engaged audience becoming a collaborative one-and-the-same.<br/><br/>But Biosphere should also be fun to play recreationally. I mean, making that exploration fun is kind of the point. Done recreationally, the group would decide how much they wanted to research and how much they already knew/wanted to skip over and just focus on the storytelling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223213/#Comment_223213" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T10:58:01+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 10:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat keeps a game like this educational rather promotional of a specific philosophy / theory / school of thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223222/#Comment_223222" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T11:21:38+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 11:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2009 11:23AM by Antiquitus.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Interesting concept.<br><br>What keeps a game like this educational rather promotional of a specific philosophy / theory / school of thought.</br></br></blockquote>\nLet's see if I understand you correctly.<br/><br/>All educational curricula (and probably all games) are promotional of specific philosophies / theories / schools of thought on many levels. They contain specific theories and organizations about the subject, they implicitly promote the ideals and frameworks of their culture of origin, etc.<br/><br/>Potentially, collaborative learning is far less indoctrinating than conventional teaching, in that its structure inherently promotes active thinking. This is why a medium like the internet is probably much healthier than a medium like TV. Both are filled with junk, but the internet has opportunities for active engagement with the junk. When active engagement and response is limited, like with a lecture or with a TV show, I think that's when indoctrination because a real risk.<br/><br/>Besides, I'll pretty much be using current standards in biological curricula as my guide to content, so even from a cynical view I will be promoting exactly what would've been promoted anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223369/#Comment_223369" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T00:24:26+00:00" title="August  8, 2009 12:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this, Julian.

It's mainly that the games I did used a set of techniques to educate, but those techniques seem less applicable to science than they are to history/social studies.  But mainly I'm thinking that you're trying to educate students about real world, external phenomena and that the information a rpg seem best at communicating are less about the external world and more about your character and their viewpoint on things.  I could see how to teach about the scientific method more easily than I could about specific pieces of scientific knowledge.  But all of that might be my own personal lack of vision (and I'm not a professional educator, which might factor in here).<br/><br/><br/>I do think, though, that rpgs could offer a different way of engaging students, and could engage different modes of thinking in the students, meaning they are likely to learn more.  Particularly some students who might not learn as much in a traditional teacher lecture format.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Giving each student information they are supposed to research and then explain in game is pretty similar to the now-standard teaching method of having students each present a chapter of the text to the other students.  This has some obvious advantages and drawbacks that I hope educators have been addressing already (some students will do a poor job researching or presenting data, so the other students suffer, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223749/#Comment_223749" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T15:09:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  3:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great Nick, thanks for your insights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223752/#Comment_223752" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T15:11:50+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  3:11PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2009 3:14PM by Antiquitus.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: double-posted for some reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
