I mean, this "yes, but" approach... not only is it non-binary, it's hook-providing, story-moving, complication-making...and all in the course of a dice throw that you'd probably be making, anyway!<br/><br/>So, my first question is: am I late to the party on this?  Is this out of vogue like stakes-setting?<br/><br/>Second, is there a name for this mechanic?  If not, we should totally coin something <i>right now</i>.  <br/><br/>Finally, what games can I find implementations of this approach?  I'm familiar with Archipelago, and it appears that Happy Birthday, Robot uses it, too.  Warhammer 3rd creates a similar result, but generates it in a different way (through boon and bane dice).   I'm hoping for more examples, or suggestions for equally nifty outcomes that are codified in the system (that is, they don't rely simply on the GM to start throwing "buts" around all over the place).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284265/#Comment_284265" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T08:25:26+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  8:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The obvious one to me is Apocalypse World.

It would be a shame to have to throw them all over the place, for sure.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures also has a system where multiple characters can bid stakes in a conflict, and each stake is resolved independently. So, suppose you have a greek myth game, where one player is Hercules, and the other is the Hydra. Hercules' stakes are "can I cut off the Hydra's head?" and the Hydra's is "Can I gobble Hercules up?" Hercules could cut off the Hydra's head, and the Hydra could still successfully eat him with one of the two new heads that grew in the old one's place.

If you pass on adding a die you get to narrate the success yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDonjon also has something similar with fact narration. The player gets to name facts that must be included in the narration but the GM gets to narrate those facts, often along with some unexpected surprises. The reverse happens if the GM succeeds, with the player narrating facts chosen by the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284328/#Comment_284328" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T14:04:15+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  2:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: derthnada</cite>Thanks for all your feedback!<br><br>Good call on Otherkind Dice.

For example, if you "act under fire" (could be literal or metaphorical fire, so you're getting shot at, or you're trying not to get caught sneaking around, or whatever) one of the consequences for a 'partial success' is to be offered an ugly choice or a hard bargain (by the GM). So, you don't have to sit there and think "man, what would be some cool things besides failure or success here?" but the GM can still come up with a situationally appropriate and creative 'hard bargain' or 'ugly choice'.<br/><br/>As for your last idea, there, about 'tacking it on' to a binary outcome system, I agree that you could do that, but I think this would be smoother in some cases than in others. <br/><br/>For example, let's say you have a pretty traditional system where you roll + skill vs target number to see if you can do something or not. For the sake of argument, let's go with Fuzion (basically) and say you roll a D10 + skill vs target number decided by GM. So, your idea is to have a second die that gives a "and, but, because, at cost" or whatever in addition to success/failure. No problem, I'm sure you could do exactly that and have a pretty fun time.<br/><br/>But you'd probably run into cases where it's strange that a super skilled guy succeeds at a super easy task with a 'but' result on the second die. In instances like that it might feel better to only map the 'qualifiers' onto borderline cases and let the very successful or very failing rolls be 'vanilla' successes/failures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284335/#Comment_284335" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T15:44:18+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  3:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those phrases are pretty much word perfect from the Nobilis rules, where since the characters are godlike it's usually not appropriate for the GM to just say "no you can't".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284338/#Comment_284338" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T16:56:20+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  4:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It amazes me that nobody has mentioned Polaris yet.

The special dice have both success and failure symbols, as well as boon and bane symbols. Different types of dice are used in different situations (stat dice, skill dice, difficulty dice, forutune/misfortune dice, etc). Therefore, it's possible to roll a success (more success symbols than failure symbols) but still suffer a negative consequence (more bane symbols than boon symbols), and vice versa. Many actions (generally provided on cards) have specific possible consequences, but the GM also has the ability to interpret the boons and banes as desired.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284359/#Comment_284359" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T00:21:49+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 12:21AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 12:25AM by Wilhelm.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Norwegian indie RPG "Itras by", uses that mechanism for task resolution.<br/><br/>A deck of cards with "Yes, and" "Yes, but" etc.  When your PC does something you can draw a card and hand it to another player who narrates the outcome of your action.<br/><br/>I stole the mechanism and bashed it together with the Polaris role division for my Dogma-competition game <a href="http://www.rollspel.nu/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/692181/wilper.html#Post692181" rel="nofollow">Fenomenet</a> (The phenomenon, a story game about doomed superheroes.

I've been hearing a lot of good stuff about AW...time to look into it further.\n<blockquote><br/>But you'd probably run into cases where it's strange that a super skilled guy succeeds at a super easy task with a 'but' result on the second die.</blockquote>\nI think this depends largely on the role that the "modifier" (and/but/whatever) die plays.  If it's strictly related to the task at hand, then yeah, that could get wonky.  But if it's responsible for anything from the task at hand to story twists, then it's perfectly cromulent.  <br/><br/>For example, let's say your expert swordsman eviscerates someone with a successful Eviscerate roll...but you've rolled a "but" on that mod die.  Task at hand: "...but, your sword get stuck in his spine."  Not bad, I guess.  Maybe, "...but now you're covered in blood."  That could be more interesing.<br/><br/>A story twist, however?  Magical!  "...but, the child you've been trying to convince that you're the 'good guy' walks in on you're emptying his guts,"  or, "...but, as he dies, his features magically shift back into those of...your brother?!"  or "...but find that he's not carrying the amulet, after all."<br/><br/>There's an awful lot of authorial control in the latter case, which sort of points back to what Chris Edwards mentioned about The Pool and Donjon.  Still, it could be a nifty way to let the story go off-roading.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
