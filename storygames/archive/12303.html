Here I am.<br/><br/>I quite liked it.<br/><br/>I came late to a Meetup.com meetup in Seattle at Wayward Coffeehouse, but the gents playing the game were happy to have me join as the game is abstract enough to allow that sort of flexibility. I became .COIL, to their .GRIP and .DEMON and GM. Now, I don't play a lot of "story" games, but I like to think that I make an effort to imbue anything more story-riffic than Monopoly with some story. I immediately sense the freedom and encouragement to help decide what was going on and what low rolls might mean in terms of complications. We wove a tale of deception and betrayal, with nothing less than free access to the ghostworld hanging in the balance.<br/><br/>Despite there being no implied setting, I found the world come to life quickly. I'm sure we each had a different idea of what it looked like, but I never sensed major contradictions in our viewpoints, except perhaps in the level of abstraction. When .SWITCH was declared to be a weapon, to some it seemed to take the form of a gun, though it needn't have. The important thing seemed to be to have the basic metaphor more or less consistent and then each of us could adapt further description to that basis. I wonder if actual perception is really that much different.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm not saying anything that those more familiar than I with story games don't already assume. Anyway, this game was everything I expected from a two-page PDF, and very, very much more. I want to keep it handy on my person so I can just bust it out whenever likeminded people are nearby.<br/><br/>A Congeries of Diverse Thoughts and Ob-servations Followes:<br/>If you're in a more permanent setting, grab a whiteboard or other communal note-taking medium and write down what is established for the various nouns.<br/><br/>Our GM thought that it might be good to have some permanent cards for the various DANGERS that might arise.<br/><br/>For this game, there was nothing to distinguish our characters from one another, but we ourselves distinguished them. .GRIP became the "getter," .DEMON the "fighter," and .COIL the "sneaker." For later games, we could distinguished our character's abilities by giving each an extra "especially well-prepared" die for what we're good at. Maybe that's what that rule was meant for anyway, but it didn't occur to anyone else (aloud, anyway) until the end.<br/><br/>Be prepared to end or gloss over scenes. Frankly, I think this is good advice for any RPG. We got caught in a couple of scenes and, maybe because they were the results of fairly-rolled DANGERs we didn't do anything in or out of game to state that they ended. This resulted in more DANGERs piling up and needing to be resolved, threatening to cement us and the story in place. I don't know a good general way to end a scene and maybe there isn't one. I might suggest that rolling a 5-6 or a 1-2 on each of at least two dice should mean that the scene will end very shortly either a positive or negative note for the /CREW. Granted, with enough dice you might roll two 5-6s and two 1-2s, but at that point the .SLEDGE has probably hit the .BREAKER, so something's going to need to give anyway.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to continue from the last paragraph, the end of a scene (if one doesn't present itself naturally) might be sounded by the accrual of a certain number of GOAL/OPPORTUNITYs and DANGERs. The idea is that one side or the other has made its intentions/capabilities clear and is building toward achievement. The side that is not gaining the advantage will need to break-off or suffer utter defeat. Of course, in the ultimate scene, it's defeat, but up until then it's time to break-off and try a different tack which (we hope) leads closer to the ultimate scene.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a great game, elegant in its simplicity. Give it a spin.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275827/#Comment_275827" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T13:57:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  1:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff, Paul.<br/><br/>When we played (Grip, Demon and Coil were our characters too!), we ended up deciding that those were the names of our roles.<br/>Grip was the person who held the "grip" on the real world, allowing us to transfer back.<br/>Demon was someone whose ghostworld addictions powered incredible strength (and rage).<br/>Coil was a technomage, using lots of steampunk-y inventions (channeling rods, mirror gloves, tesla coils, etc) to modify time and space.<br/><br/>We ended up using "especially well prepared" as "the stuff that you are trained &amp; specialized in, as per your role".<br/>I was the only one who actually used much equipment (as the Coil), the others just had innate powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275836/#Comment_275836" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T15:11:37+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  3:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played today, along with four others.

Just separate the success and the danger!<br/><br/>Example: You can buckle down, make it through the electro-psionic field, and then continue to act and do whatever for a while. Say you successfully get through the field, disable it for your crew, and then spend some time grabbing loot. But disabling the field alerted the guards, and a few minutes later you hear <i>dogs</i> coming for you down the corridor. Everyone grabs their packs and starts to run down the hallway, but your exhaustion finally washes over you. You follow your crew a few halting steps down the hallway before collapsing to the ground, unconscious. With the enemies approaching, what does your crew do? Run and leave you to certain death? Stop and fight? Something else? Danger fulfilled. <br/><br/>You've had your success and your danger, and the danger's fulfillment came as a result of the original test (your exhaustion came from pushing through the field, and it eventually caught up with you.) That's the beauty of being able to temporally separate Dangers and Goals (and is also why you should word Dangers relatively broadly rather than extremely specifically).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275866/#Comment_275866" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T22:18:39+00:00" title="June 13, 2010 10:18PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>If a player rolls a full success for their goal to<i>Fight Your Way Through the Pain</i>, I think that they should<i>get</i>that full success.</blockquote>\nI think maybe the issue here is that the move (oh look I called it a 'move', how strange) has to include another goal as context.

But let's pretend he rolled a 6 and a 1.<br/>Demon chooses to punch that fist all the way through the spider's frame, even as like six of its spindly limbs plunge through his own chest.<br/>The yolk spills up his arm, the spider writhes on its human stake, and then it dies.<br/>They are frozen there for a moment, both impaled upon the other.<br/>Demon passes out from the disgusting stench, a moment later.</i><br/><br/>There.<br/>That's how you use that "move".<br/>There is nothing partial about that success.

Here's the text: \n<blockquote>//When you suffer harm, you can resist serious injur y, fight your way through the pain, or impress with your toughness//</blockquote>\nI guess another way to put it would be that even if you decide it is a soak roll, the goal for that kind of use of the rule is presumably -- like it says -- to 'resist serious injury'. Not to stay conscious. I mean, let's say somebody gets savaged by a vicious pack of .Spiders and you want to figure out what that means, in terms of their health -- that would probably be covered by 'resist serious injury.' The goal there seems straightforward: if you succeed, you aren't seriously injured. If you fail, you are. You could resist serious injury, but still lose consciousness -- the .Spiders leave you for dead, but it turns out once you wake up you're mostly okay! -- or you could fail to resist serious injury, but remain awake -- the .Spiders tear up your leg, crippling you, but you manage to drag yourself to safety, still alert!<br/><br/>So that would be the part that is like a soak roll. Impress through toughness presumably has a pretty obvious goal-result, too, which jives easily with falling unconscious or not. 'Whoa, he took a bullet to the chest and walked right up to the enemy agent and growled out 'is that all you got?'... then passed out the moment the agent ran out the door.' That sort of thing.<br/><br/>This leaves fighting through the pain. It was my suggestion that this phrase requires some context -- you are fighting through the pain <i>to some effect</i>, which is a bit different from the other two phrases. I wasn't really intending to defend the sanctity of the text, but I thought maybe I had misremembered it or something.

There seems to be three different assumptions for it in this thread alone. In your example, it seems to mean "stay conscious."
