As written in the basic rules, it's a bit bland. With the added "harm move", it's more involved, but most people forget to roll the move... and when they do it can really feel like it's overkill.<br/><br/>I wrote up a fairly involved <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptive-visceral-approach-to-harm/p1" rel="nofollow">harm hack</a> a while back. I used it in an Apocalypse World game and it worked extremely well, although it does paint injuries in such vivid colours that they can feel overwhelming if you're playing a game where people get hurt all the time. Works great for a more "drama-oriented" game of Apocalypse World that's more Firefly and less Mad Max, though.<br/><br/>I was thinking about how I would redesign harm if I wanted to use the existing countdown clock, however. Something closer to the way the rules are written.<br/><br/>The simplest is: use the harm countdown clock just like any other countdown clock. When you get hurt, mark a segment. When it reaches 9:00, it starts getting worse on its own. <br/><br/>Optionally, when you take really bad harm, it goes straight to 9:00 (like many other clocks do). That's it. That would work pretty well, except now we don't really care about weapons and armour anymore. Still, a pretty good way to play, if you ask me.<br/><br/>But if you want something a little more involved, here are two other options. They're not playtested; I just thought I'd throw them out there and get your thoughts. They're fairly similar (hearing which you like better is part of what I'd like to see, as well as why).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Hacking Harm, Closer to the Rules</b><br/><br/>In all cases, use the harm countdown as per the rules, including healing and so on:<br/><br/>Harm past 9:00 gets worse on its own, and when you mark the last segment, you either suffer a debility or you die.<br/><br/>This brings them totally in-line with the rules as written. However, you will no longer use the harm move; these replace that.\n<blockquote><br/><b>Version 1</b><br/><br/>When you get banged up or injured, mark one segment on your harm countdown clock and ask the MC how dangerous it is. The MC will say:<br/><br/>--"It hurts like a bitch!": roll as-is.<br/>--"This is serious: this could kill you...": choose an extra option <br/>in addition to whatever your result says (below).<br/>--"Looks like you're dead meat...": choose two extra <br/>options in addition to whatever your result says (below).<br/><br/>Now, roll+armor:<br/><br/>10+ You can just shrug it off, unless it was serious harm (see above).<br/>7-9 Choose one option from the list.<br/>miss Choose two options from the list.<br/><br/>* The wound hampers you heavily<br/>* The wound will bleed or fester, and get worse without treatment<br/>* You're knocked back, stunned, or confused - you lose your position, <br/>advantage, or momentum<br/>* Mark an additional segment of harm<br/>* Mark an additional segment of harm<br/></blockquote>\nNotes: The the categories of harm are based on the situation, not the weapon. I like this better than abstract harm ratings in AW. For instance, getting sprayed by a shotgun at long range might not be that scary - it'll hurt like a bitch (a typical result is one choice from the list, perhaps bleeding or knocked over and stunned). But if someone puts that same shotgun up against your belly and pulls the trigger... looks like you're dead meat. (A typical result here might be marking two segments of your clock, bleeding profusely, and lying on the ground unable to move.)<br/>\n<blockquote><br/><b>Version 2</b><br/><br/>When you're banged up or injured, mark one segment on your countdown clock. You may:<br/><br/>* Take a moment to assess the damage. Ask the MC how bad it is. <br/>* Choose to tough it out, instead. If so, roll+armor, and add 1 if it didn't seem life-threatening:<br/><br/>13+ all 3.<br/>10+ choose 2<br/>7-9 choose 1<br/><br/>* You aren't knocked back, stunned, or confused: you can react immediately (pumped with adrenaline, take +1forward)<br/>* The wound doesn't hamper your movements or senses<br/>* The wound will heal just fine without treatment (otherwise it will get worse)<br/><br/>On a miss, you just made it even worse for yourself and the MC will tell you how (the MC makes a move, as usual), but mark an extra segment of harm, as well.<br/></blockquote>\nThis one leaves it up to the player: do you want to roll the harm move, or not? In a tense situation, you're gonna want to. If you're able to wait it out, though, then you won't waste time rolling and generating results we don't care about anyway.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449912/#Comment_449912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-06T01:04:03+00:00" title="December  6, 2015  1:04AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2015 1:04AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            V2, if you choose to ask the MC how bad it is, what happens then?  How do we determine whether you're stunned, hampered, festering, etc.?<br/><br/>Between V1 and V2, I think V2 is cleaner as is, injecting an additional choice and consequences of that choice that aren't redundant with the initial outcome of "you have taken harm".  On the other hand, I'm not sure how well they make harm feel and matter the way you want it to feel and matter -- depends on your answer to my question above.<br/><br/>As for V1, I like the fictional logic, but am not loving the procedure.  First we establish that I suffer harm.  We already know how that happened, fictionally and mechanically.  Then the GM confirms that (most likely), slotting it into one of three categories.  Then I roll again, choosing 0 to 4 options from a 4-option list, depending on the roll and the category, with some of the options being "it did more harm" or things that don't fit well with some categories ("just getting banged up" is a counter-intuitive match for most).  I can't really compare this to how AW Harm normally works; all I can say is that it feels awkward to me.  I don't want to pause the fiction for a GM back-and-forth while my degree of injury is in limbo, and I don't want to decide my own injury outcomes.<br/><br/>What I'd prefer:<br/><br/>Whatever roll established the harm, those dice stand.  GM adds armor, looks up the Harm outcomes, and chooses from the options provided.<br/><br/>If there has to be a second roll, fine, but the player should make it the second it's determined that there will be Harm, and the GM should do the talking and deciding from there.<br/><br/>This is clearly just a matter of taste, but I took that as the purpose of your inquiry, so there ya go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449913/#Comment_449913" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-06T06:01:13+00:00" title="December  6, 2015  6:01AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2015 6:02AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting! Thanks.<br/><br/>My intention for "Ask the MC how bad it is" is that the MC describes the wound and damage, following AW Principles as usual (make AW real, be a fan of the characters, etc). However, by accepting that you're out of the action for a while, you're leaving yourself at the mercy of the MC. It's probably not going to be good, but you'll have an idea of how to manage it and can start looking for a solution (like bandaging up a heavily bleeding wound). You're definitely "ceding the initiative" here, however.<br/><br/>The harm move becomes kind of like a specialized "acting under fire" move, with the fire being your injury.<br/><br/>Based on your feedback, I'd probably change "just getting banged up" to something like "it hurts like a bitch"; that's less confusing. I'll go and edit that in.<br/><br/>As for your preferred version, that sounds exactly like Johnstone's version of the move: you take harm, and the MC chooses from the list, one option per point of harm (they are things like "you're bleeding" or "you're knocked unconscious"), no roll involved.<br/><br/>I think making the move a player-facing one and giving the player some options is more in line with the AW works, however, and is my preference, quite strongly. (As an MC, I don't want to be making that call. I prefer the back-and-forth of "MC narrates PC getting injured, we roll - or don't - and player announces the results, since they inform what he does next: "I'm bleeding but I can fight back, I'll deal with the blood loss later - I stab the son of a bitch in the throat!" That's the dynamic I'm going for here.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
