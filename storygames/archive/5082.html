It seems to me that 0 hit points in a combat will happen a lot and given the present rules, you'd better not to. Same thing for the First One Down experience rule.</blockquote>\nI took out the immunity to death thing for a couple reasons.  The most important is that it wasn't making me happy.  I just wasn't digging it.  I like the potential violent end for these adventuring characters.  <br/><br/>I'll point out that you really don't have all that much chance of loosing your character if there's someone around to nurse you back to health.  Check my math on this, but I'm pretty sure that the two rolls give you about a 94% chance of survival every time you drop to 0 HP.<br/><br/>Playtesting will tell for certain if I like this better than the immunity thing.  But I'm guessing that if I change anything now, it'll be to increase your chances of survival.\n<blockquote>- why the very heavy weapons ? With their 3 points of damage people will always chose them rather than heavy weapons if they have the size (of course).<br/><br/>If you have the size to handle the very heavy weapon, then no, there is no reason for you to take a heavy weapon instead.  You might as well get the damage in.  I made this change to give the characters with a big Size a slightly greater bonus.<br/><br/>But!  Consider that there's nothing that says the GM cannot make a treasure Heavy.  Or Very Heavy.  Or Very-Very Heavy.  Can your character carry out that 8' gold statue AND swing a boulder on a stick?<br/><br/>Once again, playtesting will tell for certain if I've made a mistake or not.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115055/#Comment_115055" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T11:14:16+00:00" title="December 18, 2007 11:14AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A 94% chance of survival makes me wonder why we're bothering to roll at all.

I love it when people play a game I love. And I want to read actual play reports. I want more GM to try more ways of preparing for the game. I want to hear about monsters, treasures, talents combos and cool adventures.<br/><br/>Like I said to Eric this version of the game seems realy better than the first one. Please note that the rules were already very good. But now their realy tightly woven. You'll see it when you'll run a fight with those rules : the synergy of arenas, weapons, show off and monster powers leads to one of the most fun fighting experience I've had in RPGs. Test it, try combos with monster powers if you're a GM, describe crazy stunts or teamwork if you're a player and see the awesome. The whole beast is for me what I hoped to find in Iron Heroes before I dropped the book.<br/><br/>And this version even introduce a conflict system that uses an original and simple way to set the stakes. It makes me want to try more non combat action in my next games.<br/><br/>The only real concern I have (and that's why I asked Eric my question) is with the disappearance of the death immunity. When I ran my two games, I didn't feel that the excitement of the game was in the fear of the PC death in every fight. I think it's more in the possibility to be the first one to go down. It's like, you know, the feeling you have when you play a realy good boardgame and you're the first to loose. Or when you're fencing and loose a match, even if you don't loose the whole challenge. I think it's what I felt when Jerome's PC went down to 0 HP in the first game.<br/><br/>And the statistic issue that John raised seems a problem for playtest. You'll need a lot of combats to realy appreciate if this rule change is good or not.<br/><br/>Finaly I realy like the opportunity to "raise the flag" that you had when you declared that a fight was potentially deadly. There's a real step-on-up quality here. Personnaly I would use this rule a lot. Cause that's my way of the ninja, you know. And back comes the violent death possibility that you like, Eric. But, that's only my thoughts as a fan and not the author. The aesthetic choices are yours.<br/><br/>So people, now, go play the Red Box Hack, please <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115144/#Comment_115144" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T14:44:55+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  2:44PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2007 2:45PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah!

When I read RBH2 and stumble upon this rule "spend the tokens after the roll", I went straight to the blog to read the corresponding entry you wrote for RBH1 (Antoine told me this wasn't in the rule of RBH1 but on the blog) and understood pretty well the example; then I told Antoine and, after checking on the blog, he recognized he was completely guilty and that I had the right to whip him next time we see each other. Since I am a very kind person, I waved this right.<br/><br/>Anyhow, rest assured you'll hear news from us as soon as we play again. If I am the GM this time, I will also be able to make a special test of the game in order to give you a more precise feedback: all the player will use the actual rule of token spending, except Antoine which, as a punishment (*), will have to use his "special" rule of spending the tokens before rolling. This way, we will be able to tell you which is best... :P<br/><br/><br/>(*) well, I guess I am not so kind after all...<br/><br/>PS: more seriously, all our previous tests concerning the Awesome Tokens were made by spending the tokens before rolling. This mean that we spent a good deal of tokens to increase the chances to hit (sometimes these tokens were in fact not needed), and that we sometimes losed the tokens (spending to increase the damage, but the roll to hit was missed). In spite of this, we managed to be victorious in the fights. I wonder if/why the "actual" rule does not give too much tokens (no token can be spent in vain in this rule)... but I assume you have tested this particular rule, since it is not new, and that it works fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115691/#Comment_115691" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T16:38:03+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  4:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2008 1:08PM by Eric Provost.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>... but I assume you have tested this particular rule...</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Er... about that.

The new monster abilities are so much more powerful than the old ones.  If the PCs start kicking monster ass, then just give the monsters more abilities!

They give power over which is named, but mainly because they tend to box which is named into something that it is not, or something more restrictive than what it can be. I have always been very bad at remembering names (particularly of my students), because I'd rather know someone for who he is, as a whole (or at least as much as I can figure) rather than a few letters. However, names are necessary to communicate, albeit imperfectly, about which is named. One way to name a thing, in order to be able to point at it without giving a false idea of what it is (or can be), would be to use "labels" with no meaning per se: for example, random sequences of letters, or even numbers. If everything would be labeled by numbers (the first one to appear would be 1 (that would label "light"), and then each new thing in the world would take the subsequent number (I would then probably be known as 245 215 785 124 854 963 547 852 457 896 521 215 155 520, or something like that, rather than "Jerome")), then there would be no danger to give a false impression of something by using its name.<br/><br/>However, I believe we all agree that "487 254 265 965 745 251 589 632 585 748 965 852 963 845 689 875" is not a very sexy or even practical name for RBH2. So, what would be?<br/><br/>If you have read up to here, you might think that I am a little mad (well, who isn't?), but, in the yadaya above, I addressed one issue of finding a new name for RBH (which Eric seems to consider): a name shouldn't give false impression on the game. I personnaly enjoy "Redbox Hack" as a name, but probably because, not having english as a native language, this name has no intrinsec meaning for me other than to designate the game (I understand the meaning once I think about it, but that's not what comes in my mind at first when I hear it; I also wonder if this it not the reason why Eric wanted that Antoine suggests french names :P).<br/><br/>"So, Jerome, stop your baloney and give some insights on the name..."<br/><br/>Obviously, and although Eric seems to have some ideas of the ambiance/world of RBH, the game is not written around something very precise concerning the background (although the rules and classes give some feeling on this). The name should therefore not be centered around the background, which is otherwise probably the best place to look for a name.<br/><br/>The name should therefore be quite generic. There are few generic RPG (compared to RPG having a more specific background). I doubt that a complete acronym, such as "GURPS", is something interesting for RBH. In fact, D&amp;D is a generic RPG in the sense that the background is quite loose (it revolves around fantasy, but no world is detailed (or not *one* world), etc.); however, the name of D&amp;D is centered around the opposition to the PC, which is not what RBH wants. So perhaps a name of this kind, but revolving around the PC: "Adventure!" (with the explanation mark) was my first idea, but still to far from the PC; so "Adventurers!" was my natural second thought; but I then found that something was missing, a touch of fantasy/mystery to attract the eye and mind of the potential player: I then turned to things as "Adventurer heart" ("Coeur d'aventurier" in french - I thought about it in french, I am not sure about the translation), that is to say still revolve around the idea of "adventurer" - which is the basic of the games, from the point of view of the players: we play adventurers, and the pleasure is fully in the adventure. But I am not completely content with "heart", but I really wanted to add a "peculiar" touch to the "adventurer" side of the name... perhaps "spirit" instead of "heart", or something completely different but intriguing enough to promote the game... <br/><br/>As we all seem to agree here, one of the *majors* interests of the game is in the simple yet effective combat system, and the gamist pleasure we take with the tokens, the arenas, etc. However, I found myself completely dry when trying to come up with a name revolving around this particular point of the game. The more I thought about it, I am not sure it is a good idea to use a name revolving around an element of the system, even if it is something we really enjoy.<br/><br/>Another idea is to pick a name a little bit further to the game, but with the right "feeling" for the game. "Warhammer" is an example that comes to my mind: although the warhammer has a little meaning with respect to the background of this game, the name is efficient because the image of a warhammer gives a pretty good image of the mood of the game. One way to do this while still giving an idea of "PC-centered" and of adventure, a possible choice (although quite basic, I know) would be "Dangerous world", or something along those lines.<br/><br/>I hope you'll forgive my awfully long post.

However, Eric noted that other people might find it interesting, so I'm reposting it and his answer.)<br/></i><br/>I've recently read the 2nd edition Red Box Hack rules a couple times in a row -- for some unknown reason I seem to find it soothing.  Strange. . .   Anyway, I find myself contemplating mixing it up a bit with the Maelstrom Storytelling setting.  Likely no good will come of this.<br/><br/>After reading the rules I found myself with a few questions.  While I can certainly make up my own answers, I'm interested in yours, if you don't mind,\n<ul><li>The Magus' <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enchant</span> talent: can it enchant weapons so they are +2 to hit?<br/></li><li>The Magus' <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mirrors</span> talent: Does the recipient have to have this talent?  Does the talent know how to find people, or do you need to know where they are?<br/></li><li>The Bear's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mighty Grip</span> talent: Does a heavy or very heavy reach weapon have both the favored arena of both a reach weapon and a heavy weapon?<br/></li><li>How long do unused Awesome tokens last?  That is, do they go away at the end of the scene, the session, or can you keep them until spent?<br/></li><li>Does a Monster's Blast do a particular amount of damage?</li></ul>\nAs for a new name -- it would be amusing to choose something with the same initials, such as <b>R</b>ed-<b>B</b>looded <b>H</b>eroes or maybe <b>R</b>uins, <b>B</b>lood &amp; <b>H</b>eroes or <b>R</b>eavers of <b>B</b>ear <b>H</b>ome or the like.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Hiya Peter,Why the whisper?  Other folks would find this information interesting too.Yes, the Enchant talent can give weapons +2 to hit.The recipient of the Mirrors communication does not have to have the ability too.  I hadn't really thought about the second part too much.  Play it by ear.Yes.  The mighty weapons get both favored arenas.Awesome tokens expire at the end of the combat scene.No.  The Blast power is a modifier for the weapon or weapons the monster already has.Thanks for the name ideas.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120500/#Comment_120500" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T17:58:32+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  5:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree about the name thing.

NICE! I'd put this up there with Donjon and Cheap and Cheesy Fantasy (where the In a Wicked Age oracle got its start) as my favorite story game dungeoncrawls. Sounds like great fun. My friend and I were discussing what he considers a "death problem" in your game. If you want to see our comments, look here: <a href="http://midnightslair.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3014" rel="nofollow">http://midnightslair.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3014</a>. If not, let me sum it up with this ...<br/><br/><i>In boargames they call it the problem of "player elimination." One person's fun stops prematurely while the fun continues for others.<br/><br/>The assumption is that you roll up a new dude and jump back in, but that's an assumption of the dungeoncrawl genre more than of RBH itself.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be cool if you could come back as a zombie or a ghost and continue crawling? What would your perils be then ... extra susceptible to evil wizards and magic weapons? Or better yet, how could you help make the game awesome without a character at all? Do you run the monsters? Play NPC villains. It would be cool to have a dungeoncrawl game where player after player dies and joins the GM's side of the table. Finally, instead of three players against the GM, it's three GM's against the player!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122389/#Comment_122389" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T12:25:01+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 12:25PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hiya Troy.

Meaning, when I read a game where you can die before the session ends, I do ask myself, what next. I'd like a game where death can occur to tackle what happens when a character dies, what happens to keep the character's player having fun.<br/><br/>Like you said, many games don't have anything there, if you die ten minutes into the session, well that's just the way it is. And like John says, people can self-select themselves out of the game if that's a problem. But in my experience a lack of fun after death results in die fudging and stuff like that in order not to engage with unfun rules (which, in most games, character death is).<br/><br/>RBH currently does not address, "so now your dead, what next", but Eric says there will be a chapter in the next iteration dealing with that, which is good enough for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122574/#Comment_122574" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T21:59:26+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  9:59PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true, Christopher.

Heck, you die in the first fight of the night I'm thinking exactly the same thing. I mean, if I was in the middle of a dungeon crawl and one of my good friends died, I'd call it a night and head back into town, give my friend the funeral they deserve.<br/><br/>Then, after the funeral, maybe I go back.<br/><br/>Would this work in all games? Nah. But I'd think it would work well in a game about killing monsters and taking their stuff. It's also reminding me of something I read or saw recently. A movie or a comic. Maybe X-Men when Professor X bought it. There's big events going down, but they take the time to do the funeral scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122887/#Comment_122887" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T22:44:48+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 10:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I can see that.

I think you have to be honest about your game. Is it a shallow beer-and-pretzels game about raiding dungeons or is it a deep story game set in the somewhat corny genre of dungeon crawling? The answer to this will determine how players react to character death. <br/><br/>How do you see it? Here are a couple of points/counterpoints. As the creator, it's up to you to decide which is true and communicate that through which brand of rules you pay attention to.<br/><br/>The game has a kind of good self-loathing to it. It targets the shallow nature of the original red box D&amp;D that was a guilty pleasure for those of us who played it back in the day. Everything in the rules relates to AT&amp;T attack and take treasure, not to drama. (Counterargument. Yes, and by streamlining the rules at this level it frees up a shit load of white space for the creation of STORY.)<br/><br/>Character creation takes seconds. Is it right to presume that character death could consume an hour or more of play time? Is your game deep enough for players to really care intensely about a character getting axed? (Counterargument. Character generation takes seconds. Character creation is ongoing right up until the minute the character dies. Isn't it right to assume that you spend an hour over the dead body of a character you have spent hours and hours making?)<br/><br/>Rules bloat is bad. The more crunchiness in a game, the more energy goes into playing the rules rather than playing the story. Therefore, I shouldn't have to or want to write character death rules, that would just bog things down. (Counterargument. Rules bloat IS bad. However, many things that are un-fun about traditional games come as much from missing structure as it does from too much structure. If you don't address character death, players may fail do anything interesting when it comes up. There is an opportunity for fun/richness here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123084/#Comment_123084" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T12:45:41+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 12:45PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2008 3:34PM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Paul,</p>\n<p>I nearly forgot about your rules questions!</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ol>\n<li>When you fail a Show Off roll, it says you give a Token to your opponent.

All I ask is that you try and read my posts without any kind of assumed "tone" in your head.<br/><br/>I raised (relayed really) the question about character death because I thought it was an intriguing one. Early player elimination is a fact of these types of games and the resulting down time for one or more players is a potential problem for groups. Maybe it deserves its own thread and is muddying up the RBH thread. As I said, you are under no obligation to address it. If you do address it though, it ought to be in keeping with the type of game you are writing and it ought to make sense. My last post was really questioning that, whether expecting that players would stop and hold a character funeral is realistic in a game that overtly focuses things on the fun but relatively superficial act of plundering dungeons.<br/><br/>Anyway, feel free to stick a big fork in this one if you like.
