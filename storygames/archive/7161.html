No offense intended." on the end of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not something, culturally, that I am not used to.  People are feeling that they have to apologise that they have an opinion? They feel that by having one, it might somehow cause offense? They feel they need to apologise beforehand incase their opinion might cause someone offense?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone explain where this comes from?

Of course, I am talking about a fundamented and logical opinion here, not a rude and aggressive reply. I feel it is almost related to that old "criticism" argument we had a while ago.

Sometimes its what people are saying. Someone saying something inflammatory and trying to get away. It's like "No offense, but that haircut looks stupid."<br/><br/>But I think a lot more of it has to do with amatuer reading and writing. (No offense, that's just my opinion). What I mean by that is that formalized writing, at least in English, is taught to assume that you are writing your opinion. So, when a reader forgets that (or never learned it because only a few of us chumps took classes where we read a lot of essays) they can confuse defininitive statements with a statement of fact, even when it's clearly opinion: "Chocolate is gross."  Since most forum posts I've seen are like that one, I'm blaming the readers. I'll back that up with: on this forum, there is a guideline to read charitably. And it works pretty well when its remembered. But in general, I think JD is wrong. It seems like quite a few people do not remember that everything is fundamentally opinion.<br/><br/>But writers aren't entirely blameless. Aside from frank opinions, which sometimes are purposefully inflammatory or one sided, the writer's responsibility is to communicate clearly. In essay writing, this would be bolstered by analysis and references, something that generally isn't done (and probably is only sometimes warranted anyway). Other times its statements of opinion, disguised as fact. Like "Nobody likes chocolate!" means "I don't like chocolate, neither do most of my friends", or rather instead of "in my opinion" being omitted it's "in my experience." All of which is often not just subjective but hyperbole, even accidentally due to the way our memories are selective to reinforce what we want to believe.<br/><br/>All of which is compounded by the immediate and casual nature of online correspondence in a medium that is broadcast without the subtle nuance or context in our usual immediate and casual methods of communication.  Tacking on "this is my opinion" won't help. If the message arouses passion within you, it will look like a dodge or cushion. If you aren't particularly effected by it, it will look unnecessary. But reading charitably and writing with consideration will help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159400/#Comment_159400" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T10:23:33+00:00" title="July 29, 2008 10:23AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2008 10:25AM by Alan.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see this in Americans, not just Canadians.

It could be everybody's fault. It could be nobody's fault. Communication is hard, responsibility for effective communication is neither static or completely one-sided. <br/><br/>This thread is full of reasons why someone might want to choose one or another style of communication, and there's no reason to think that you only get to choose once, <i>ever</i>. You get to choose every time you open your mouth, or post, what kind of approach you want to take to the conversation at hand. If someone is prone to freaking out and feeling judged, maybe it's worth adding 'in my opinion' when you say some things to them. It's not like you're making some kind of grand philosophical commitment by doing so. Then again maybe it's not worth it, or unnecessary, and you decide not to do so. This is equally inconsequential to the grand scheme of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159626/#Comment_159626" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T17:29:04+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  5:29PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2008 5:30PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's ever worthwhile to apologize for your opinion, whether it's in real life or on the internet.<br/><br/>However, it's worthwhile to explicitly identify possibly-inflammatory statements as an opinion on the internet, in order to keep the flamewars down to a minimum.

That culture doesn't automatically treat words as merely the speakers opinion, because they hope to find people who don't speak opinion and instead speak truth. If they were to treat each speakers word as just their opinion, they feel they would block themselves off from the 'truth speakers'.<br><br>This means that to a degree they are always listening as if what they hear is true. So when what they hear clashes with their beliefs, they aggrivatedly blame the speaker for doing something 'wrong'. Because each time it adds another reason to not just believe what you hear, and the more of those reasons there are, the more they are seperated from the truth speakers they might find, or have found. It takes them awhile to flush those reasons away.<br><br>It's not about just managing flamewars or writing clearly. When you pander to these audience needs, your line of enquiry gets damaged. Realise what your getting back is flawed because of all the consessions made in the enquiry and decide whether flawed goods are better than what you could get elsewhere (usually it's a choice of flawed goods or no goods at all). But don't bother thinking managing flame wars or meeting the needs of the audience perfectly will result in perfect goods, or your ending up in the same position as them - your not questioning what your getting. Being a well spoken little poster with lots of happy responces doesn't mean you get truth. And being a shit speaker usually damages the goods even more. I make no case for aggitation.<br><br>It'd probably be good as the theme for a roleplay game, that whole situation.

I said I felt part of the resistance to 4E and the complaint that it was more like an MMO was because a lot of hardcore D&amp;D players liked the complexity and barrier to entry for new players. It was a pride thing, and "dumbing it down" was frustrating for them. Another person posted that 4E just didnt "feel like D&amp;D" and my response was "Yeah, I don't buy that argument," with some counterpoints.<br><br>The poster went ballistic, basically reading "I don't buy that argument" as saying their opinion had no value and that I felt they were being argumentative. I spent most of the rest of the thread trying to convince them I didn't mean that and I wasn't as much of a prick as they thought I was.<br><br>When I typed "I don't buy that argument" I heard it in my head as a conversation between friends. I don't think anyone would have gotten pissed had I been having a face to face conversation, but on the Internet,,, man, it was perceived by that person as an absolute attack.<br><br>So, to me, its no wonder people try to soften their opinion by pointing out its only opinion.

I saw <a href="http://www.elfwood.com//art/g/o/gonzales/sirena.jpg.html" rel="nofollow">this picture</a>. So I posted a comment.<br/><br/><i>"I love the characterization and the outfit. Anatomically the only problem I have is with the arms. They look really awkward and strange. I know she is supposed to look muscular and though, yet lean and gracious... But that doesn\u2019t mean the arms have to look weird and deformed. Everything else looks good to me."</i><br/><br/>Could I have phrased that differently? Sure. Was I rude or dismissive? I don't think so. Did I have the need to "apologize" for my opinion, or triple stress it was <b>only my opinion</b>? Definitely not. I was not arguing style, build, looks or anything. I was talking about anatomy, which is something I have studied for many many years myself. Those were minor but noticeable mistakes.<br/><br/>What did this guy answered?<br/><br/><i>"The biceps and pectoral are a bit off on the arm holding the rear end of the halberd, but other than that, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the shape of the arms. neither did my college drawing professor, or anyone else I asked for open critiques for that matter.<br/><br/>I referenced many images of female fitness models and bodybuilders for the image, and happen to seen quite a few real, non-steroid using muscular women in my time. I also happen to like that kind of build anyway.<br/><br/>If you can show that they are anatomically incorrect, (aside from that which I have already stated) then please do, but if this is just an "ooh, she has more muscles than some guys, she looks deformed" type of issue, then please back off.<br/><br/>I have no tolerance for sexism in the field of athletics, and/or desirable and undesirable builds.<br/><br/>the last time I checked, the biceps of a straightened, hypertrophied arm remains visible as a long mass of tissue projecting up at an even, low height from the plane of the forearm up to the shoulders, and the triceps bulge at the top of the arm creating a triangular shape along the back/bottom of the arm with the large end at the top, meeting with the shoulder.<br/><br/>We all know what a contracted bicep looks like, and the triceps on an arm in this position fades into an even curve at the bottom of the arm.<br/><br/>As near as I can reference the placement of the veins is all right too. They may not need to be *quite* so blue, but that is what veins tend to do on very fair/pale skinned people.<br/><br/>The only problem I might see, is that the contracted bicep is probably to close to the elbow and needs to be backed up so that the pectoral does not need to extend quite so far to meet it.<br/><br/>If it\u2019s something about "elves can\u2019t be muscular", once again, please can it. elves are "slender and lean" so I should say they should be on average slightly leaner than an average human. This elf is not average. She is representative of what an elven bodybuilder would look like, and is much leaner than some human, non-steroid using, real life female bodybuilders and athletes.<br/><br/>If you are ignorant of what a real muscular women looks like, have a look here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amg-lite.com/?view=http://www.amgprofiles.com/Brig-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.amg-lite.com/?view=http://www.amgprofiles.com/Brig-</a> - ita/Pics/Brigita3001.jpg<br/><a href="http://www.gymessentials.com/buff-babes/melissa-dettwiller/pi-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gymessentials.com/buff-babes/melissa-dettwiller/pi-</a> - cs/Melissa-Dettwiller-02.jpg<br/><a href="http://www.probodybuildingdvds.com/images/malissa-robles%5B1%-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.probodybuildingdvds.com/images/malissa-robles[1%-</a> - 5D.jpg<br/><a href="http://www.glamourmuscle.com/CindyP/Pics/Cindy3004.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.glamourmuscle.com/CindyP/Pics/Cindy3004.jpg</a><br/><br/>All of these are images of real women, without any digital editing to change the appearance of their physiques. Also, they don\u2019t use steroids, and are actually on the middle end of the female bodybuilding spectrum. Heavyweights would be even more muscular. Before you go citing steroids for the lack of breasts on one of the examples, let me remind you that bodybuilders must go on extreme diets to eliminate all the fat in their bodies before a competition, and that breasts are mostly fat, and usually the first thing to go when a woman goes on that type of diet, which is why most fbbs have implants or such.<br/><br/>Now, you can think they\u2019re unattractive, etc., and that\u2019s your right. You don\u2019t need to share my opinion, and I won\u2019t blame you for yours, but I have no patience for those who would refer to them as "disfigured" being as that their muscles are a completely natural, albeit large, shape, nor those who would call them "manly" being as that a male bodybuilders of the same level of strength, etc. would be, and are MUCH larger thanks to hormonal and anatomical differences between the sexes.<br/>Finally, I won\u2019t let opinion of another that a muscular female body is undesirable, or unattractive dictate the kind of woman I decide to draw.<br/><br/>If I want to draw an overweight woman, I\u2019ll draw an overweight woman. If I want to draw an underweight woman, I\u2019ll draw an underweight woman. If I want to draw an average woman, I\u2019ll draw an average woman. If I want to draw a very plain woman, I\u2019ll draw a plain woman, and I reserve all these rights when drawing men as well.<br/><br/>I refuse to buy into the idea that only the average, and/or social/cultural norm is worth recognizing, it encourages conformism for the sake of conforming, mediocrity, and the kind of culture that generates all of the ignorant, idiotic, self-centered, unhealthy blond bimbos we have running around today.<br/><br/>And after looking at your gallery, I really think you should work on your own anatomical issues just a little bit first, before going around telling other people who have gone to school specifically to learn how to draw, spending hours upon hours drawing real live nude models, what a human body looks like.<br/><br/>Not trying to sound harsh, and if I was mistaken, I apologize, but I\u2019m really fed up with people who can\u2019t accept anything outside of their comfort zone."</i><br/><br/>(continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159762/#Comment_159762" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T08:25:13+00:00" title="July 30, 2008  8:25AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2008 8:26AM by Tristan.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crap...

That, and only that, is exactly what I was referring to. Not all that baggage you threw at me without knowing me at all.<br/><br/>I did feel attacked, so I replied.<br/><br/><i>"Yeah! Hold your horses, my friend. You were really quick to jump to conclusions and start putting words in my mouth.<br/><br/>You pointed out the problems I spotted pretty well. That was pretty much what I was referring to. Maybe I\u2019ll add that her left forearm seems a lot shorter than it should be (compared to her humerus length).<br/><br/>I never said anything about me not liking muscular women, nor about fit and strong elves... I never said anything about anyone being unattractive (my exact words were "<b>Anatomically</b> the only problem I have is with the arms... Everything else looks good to me." ). And accusing me of being sexist was pretty aggressive and personal. Do you know me good enough to say something that big?<br/><br/>I think you felt to that you dislike so much yourself. You prejudged me, based on your perspective and without thinking that my critique was only that. A constructive critique, trying to point out the only thing I found improvable in your illustration.<br/><br/>Now, I\u2019m not perfect myself. I do have many issues I\u2019d have to improve. I never said I hadn\u2019t. But I have studied this stuff too. And I know when something doesn\u2019t look natural (and I do not mean it as in "women should not be muscular" ).<br/><br/>So, are we cool?"</i><br/><br/>His answer:<br/><br/><i>"Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, it was the "disfigured" part that set me off.<br/><br/>Overall it was a stupid time for me to try replying to any comments...

However, the instant, the very instant my eyes passed over this statement: "But that doesn\u2019t mean the arms have to look weird and deformed." I internally rolled my eyes, and went, "oh oh." So yes, the guy over-reacted, but I'd absolutely expect some sort of reaction to those words.<br/>\nYou also said, "But that doesn\u2019t mean the arms have to look weird and deformed. Everything else looks good to me. " That last sentence looks exactly, to me, like this:<br/>\n"But that doesn\u2019t mean the arms have to look weird and deformed. Everything else looks good to me. But that's just my opinion."<br/>\nIt's a dsitancing phrase, a banlancing phrase - you know you're saying something the other person might not like, so you also make sure to point out that there are things you liked too. After all, "Everything else looks good to me." is pretty weak praise without much substance. You've already described what you liked and what worked at the start of your post - this phrase doesn't seem necessary except for this reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'm with Graham W. (We Brits are an insular people and must stick together.) I said above that I thought, much of the time, that statements like "But that's my opinion," is implicitly adding to the post, "and I respect your right to think differently." Much of this thread appears to be people saying, "I don't like the way some people talk, and I don't respect any reason they have for doing it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159826/#Comment_159826" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T10:51:47+00:00" title="July 30, 2008 10:51AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Everything else looks good to me." was not meant as a weak praise.

And in some conversations, that's what it boils down to: not opinion, but fact or truth. Sometimes folks are mistaken on the internet (no, really, it happens!) and I will avoid "IMHO" and its ilk to make the stronger assertion of fact. I might even write "in point of fact" or "according to [Insert Unquestionable Authority on Subject here]" and go on to correct my benighted opposition.<br><br>And, invariably, the gyres begin. My favorite is when folks argue, "no, the dictionary is not an authority on what a word means" and proceed to further-confuse the conversation with sloppy diction. God hates editors... and so I feel obliged to step in and correct terminology and offer alternative, more-meaningful or less-ambiguous terminology... and get flamed for being a pedant. I never apologies... though I might be sorry I bothered.<br><br/>So if you see--and cringe at--IHMO before something I say, it's because I most-often state inviolate truths or best practices, which care not for opinion. I write IMHO so that my regular readers don't automatically agree with my point.<br/><br/>Am I smiling or not?                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160292/#Comment_160292" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-01T15:44:06+00:00" title="August  1, 2008  3:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2008 3:44PM by Tristan.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">Link originally posted at the "Stuff to watch: August 2008" thread.</a><br/><br/>I think the following quote sums it up pretty well.<br/><br/><i>The willingness of trolling \u201cvictims\u201d to be hurt by words makes them complicit, and trolling will end as soon as we all get over it.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160305/#Comment_160305" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-01T17:12:10+00:00" title="August  1, 2008  5:12PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I can get behind that: the problems between people will end as soon as everyone adopts exactly the same point of view.<br/>Not sure if it's entirely practical, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160318/#Comment_160318" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-01T20:10:42+00:00" title="August  1, 2008  8:10PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the guy was reffering more to a "stop whining and do not put more weight into stuff that is meaningless".<br/><br/>It takes two to start a fight.
