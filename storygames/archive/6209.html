I'm inclined to have a very liberal definition of roleplaying, and "I know it when I see it" has always been enough for me.  I've seen people treat <i>Shadows Over Camelot </i>as a nebulous proto-RPG, and that's pure fun.  I've seen people play explicit RPGs as tactical exercises - also fun.  I don't really care about definitions, but I <i>really </i>care about that "I know it when I see it" zone, because I want my current project to live there happily.<br/><br/>Right now it's a pretty functional game that has an over-arching plot, defined characters, compelling situation, a juicy little set of mechanical gears and wheels that force players to make difficult choices, and would fit comfortably on the shelf next to <i>Shadows Over Camelot</i>, for example.  It's a game you could bring roleplaying (that thing I know when I see it) into, but that you probably wouldn't.  It's fun without it and it plays fine.  Right now any roleplaying I introduced would be of the "step 3b:  Now roleplay until it is time for step 3c" variety, which is worse than no guidance at all.  <br/><br/>I'm not really satisfied with that, though - I want all the cool interplay and some organic, interesting, fun and useful roleplaying as well.  I recognize that retrofitting my current design might be futile, and that's cool, but let's talk about the intersection of activity and mechanics a bit.  <br/><br/>Some questions:<br/><br/>1.  Is it enough to design systems and procedures that <i>allow </i>roleplaying to occur and trusting your players to follow their own instincts?<br/><br/>2.  Is the act of roleplaying so central that it must be designed around?  Or can it be firewalled away from system entirely?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137817/#Comment_137817" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T07:39:11+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  7:39AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny, I have started thinking about the idea of "filler RPGs", due to playtesting <i>Business Solutions</i>.  The game I've been poking at recently (currently called "Wuxia Melodrama" but desperately in need of a better name) is an attempt to create one of these.  <i>Sons of Liberty</i> probably falls into this category as well.<br/><br/>So, my preliminary (and semi-contradictory) thoughts:<br/><br/>--I really don't like games that claim to be about roleplaying/storytelling but simply do so by tacking it on.  I'm looking here at <i>Lunch Money</i> and <i>Gloom</i>.  IMHO, if you can play the game in a satisfying way without roleplaying, then it's not *about* roleplaying.  As such, any roleplaying that comes out of such games tends to be unsatisfying, or at least disconnected from the actual events of play.<br/><br/>--I once dressed up as a Servant of Cthulhu to go to an Illuminati tournament.  Was that roleplaying?  And if I sat at the table, muttering "Cthulhu fhtagn", am I roleplaying?  I think so.  So, it's possible to tack roleplaying on to almost any game and have it be a fun part of the broader activity.<br/><br/>So, I'd answer your questions as follows:<br/><br/>1)  Yes, so long as those systems and procedures function without the roleplaying.<br/><br/>2)  If you want the game to be about roleplaying, then yes, you need to design for it.  Otherwise, clever players can bring it in anywhere, but it won't really be central or (likely) significant to the game being played.<br/><br/>Somewhere, there was an article about a group drifting Monopoly into an RPG on the fly.  I'm not sure I remember where that was, though.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137818/#Comment_137818" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T07:39:53+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  7:39AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Duh.  <a href="http://ptgptb.org/0016/monopoly.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> it is.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137821/#Comment_137821" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T07:43:34+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  7:43AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Is the act of roleplaying so central that it must be designed around?

Is it colour, or is it central to the decision-making process? Compare roleplaying activities in a good ole D&amp;D dungeon crawl with that of IAWA, or with Diplomacy. Clearly, the "acting a role" facet is strictly colour in the first game, though very central to events in the second, and "freeform" table talk and negotiation constitutes the entire game of Diplomacy.<br/><br/>If you're just looking for colour, I think you can strap it onto most games, if not most leisure activities in general. If you're looking to use the act of character acting and/or table talk to influence the outcome of the game, I think it's a good idea to design for this to begin with.<br/><br/>I'm interested in seeing what comes out of this thread. I want to jerry-rig roleplaying onto Illuminati! and A Game of Thrones so badly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137822/#Comment_137822" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T07:49:30+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  7:49AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My guiding principle is "this game is cool, but it is much cooler when we roleplay these characters interacting"  I think you can say this about <i>D&amp;D</i>, for example. <i>Shadows Over Camelot, </i>not so much.

I agree that if your actual game design goal is to foster roleplay during the game then its not enough to simply design so as to not exclude it.  We don't roleplay <i>Shadows</i> because the majority of the group simply isn't that comfortable with the notion of interjecting roleplay into the game.  So without even seeing your game, based solely on what you've said so far, my group probably wouldn't roleplay it even though that may make you weep bowls of salty tears in a manner similar to your icon.<br/><br/>You "want all the cool interplay and some organic, interesting, fun and useful roleplaying".  I think the last of those is crucial to those on the fence roleplayers like my group.  If you want to actively foster the rp then it needs to somehow be useful in establishing game important facts.  If its take it or leave it, some groups are inevitably going to leave it.  As you know, some folks, like the massively talented and creative Durham 3, could probably roleplay any game, <i>Hungry Hungry Hippo</i> included.  Then there's some folks who can probably manage to play entire campaigns of a tabletop RPG without any actual roleplaying, despite the system created for it.  Or are they roleplaying?<br/><br/>Hmmm...you know what?  The absolute relevance of this discussions title has just hit me squarely in the face.  Indeed, what exactly is roleplaying?<br/><br/>All I can say constructively now at this point is that if you want my group to roleplay <i>Shadows</i>, its gonna need to be mechanically tied to the game in some fashion so that our roleplaying has tangible effects on the game itself and its outcome.  What a lot of words for so little input...<br/><br/><i>Edit:  And when I started this comment, believe it or not, no one had posted so sorry for pretty much saying what those before me have already said.

You can imagine a continuum in which one end is occupied by abstract games like chess or go (in which a move has tactical value but no referential import--it stands for nothing but itself) and the other by free-form games (in which a "move" is pure symbol; it stands for something in the game-fiction but is not bound by anything at the game-table). The ground in the middle--which is what we're talking about--is harder to make sense of.<br/><br/>If we start with the notion of parlor narration, which I take to mean adding fictional color to a self-contained game-mechanical system (so that the "roleplaying" is a dispensable adjunct to play), what do you have to do to make the roleplaying an essential component?<br/><br/>I think I'm playing with this in <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/wjw11/Perilous%20Realm%201.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Perilous Realm</a>, a game I've just finished drafting. The game-play is all about dealing with the ebb and flow of your bodily humours, with an eye toward how that will influence both the end-game and your own individual capabilities. But there are two places where roleplaying is built in to the game, explicitly: when your humours are unbalanced, you have to discard a card or roleplay the imbalance, and when your character is in a building scene (a "prep") you have to pick someone to roleplay with you and then declare what the outcome of your prep was at the end of scene.<br/><br/>The answer implicit in the game is that roleplaying isn't automatic; it has to be built into the game if you want it to happen. And the way it does that is by trying to link game-mechanical outcomes to "symbolic" moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137847/#Comment_137847" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T09:35:04+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  9:35AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is no inherent RP to be found, at best, you can make it a Story-Game.<br/><br/>The RP factor is added by interested parties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137848/#Comment_137848" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T09:36:01+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  9:36AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; 1.

Enough for what?  <br/><br/>&gt; 2. Is the act of roleplaying so central that it must be designed around? Or can it be firewalled away from system entirely?<br/><br/>I'm sure it's possible to graft on a roleplaying module on to any given system; I'm not sure it's especially useful.<br/><br/><br/>The more I think about this the more I think the answer lies somewhere in the realm of Character.  In the sense that, not to be overly-pedantic about it, in order to roleplay, one requires a role to play.  So the nature of those roles within any particular game are going to be important, is my sense.<br/><br/>Something stands out in your earlier description of your game:<br/><br/>&gt; mechanical gears and wheels that force players to make difficult choices<br/><br/>What makes those choices difficult for the players?  To over-simplify things, I think it might be useful to consider two axes:  tactical/strategic, and moral/ethical.<br/><br/>Some examples, probably subjective and subject to argument:<br/><br/>High tactical/strategic difficulty, low moral/ethical difficulty:  Chess, Go<br/><br/>Low tactical/strategic difficulty, high moral/ethical difficulty:  The Pool, PrimeTime Adventures, kill puppies for satan<br/><br/>High tactical/strategic difficulty, high moral/ethical difficulty:  Sorcerer, The Riddle of Steel<br/><br/>Low tactical/strategic difficulty, low moral/ethical difficulty:  Tic-Tac-Toe, Snakes and Ladders<br/><br/><br/>Where do you think your game might fit in?<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137849/#Comment_137849" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T09:37:22+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  9:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be an interesting experiment to play a game where you role-played as little as possible and see where the system forced you to actually do the act of role-playing.<br/><br/>That might be neat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137853/#Comment_137853" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T09:54:14+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  9:54AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing <i>Agon</i> last night, very little roleplaying was happening near the end, as we got tired and had less energy for the posturing and bold voices that roleplaying <i>Agon</i> requires. Especially during combat, the game became a chorus of: "Roll position! GLORY! Roll defense! FAIL! Roll armor! GLORY! Roll attack! GLORY! You killed 1 mook! MORE GLORY! Roll position..."  I expect a lot of groups play D&amp;D or Rifts this way too, at least a fair amount of the time.  So, I guess my criteria would be, if you game allows for at least the amount of roleplaying that <i>Agon</i> does, I think that's enough.  <i>Agon</i> is still deliriously fun, even when the amount of roleplaying that's happening is fairly low.  And, honestly, I'm not sure I would enjoy a game of <i>Agon</i> that played out in the languid, heavy roleplaying fashion of old school <i>Vampire</i> campaigns.

There is a clear goal (find the murderer), that everyone is trying to achieve, but at the same time you are told that you must be roleplaying to do so.

There is a clear goal (find the murderer), that everyone is trying to achieve, but at the same time you are told that you must be roleplaying to do so. The roleplaying there is not an addition, it's the method you must employ to win the game.

That's not a cry for you to divulge anything, just the issue I deal with when trying to think about this topic in the framework you're dealing with.  What I mean is, I can't think of a boardgame I've ever played that really pushed me to want to roleplay or act in "character".  One of the problems behind that is that there is such a finite amount of complication within most boardgames that it seems that roleplaying those out would get pretty repetitive.  There can be numerous combinations of tactical complications that make for different gameplay each time but the roleplay would still be limited to the underlying core complications that are repeated.<br/><br/>I think you increase the grist for the roleplaying mill by injecting your game with highly charged game situations where the decisions being made actually lend themselves to being expressed through roleplay.  The more drama inducing decision points that the game has the more likely you'll find folks getting into character to portray it.<br/><br/>If you however want to have roleplay of the nature that actually drives and helps to create the game as it happens, you'll need some mechanics to outline how the game is affected by the players wishes.  I think that's where part of the "cool" comes from in roleplaying, knowing that you're no longer limited to a set of finite complications but instead have a means for interacting with and defining the direction of the game in a very real way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137885/#Comment_137885" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:38:32+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:38AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It only has moral/ethical bearings if you consider it that way.

So if you can't _force_  it to happen, you want to encourage it, and that means you need to provide incentives for doing so, or disincentives for not.  Now, the disincentive angle doesn't appeal to me too much, so I'm going to swing in from the incentive angle and say that the examples and ideas are just as easily inverted if you want.<br/><br/>Ok, so I want to provide incentives for roleplaying.  That's a tough place to be because I now need to decide what atomic actions, present in the game, give me opportunities for that.  Worse still, I am faced with the question of what roleplaying _is_, and as we all know that is a painful debate with no right answer.  And that means i can sit arond and try to come up with an answer that fits every definition of roleplaying, or i could say to hell with it and just accept my model will be imperfect.<br/><br/>So given that, I have a few models to draw from.  First, let's assume I wanted to incentivize some other behavior at the table - let's say profanity.  If I swear during my turn I get a cookie (Which is to say, a card, a reroll, a bonus, an extra turn - whatever it is, something mechanically meaningful).  Now, this is pretty clear cut whether I've done it or not, so It polices itself well - If I violate this and try to take the cookie without swearing, one of the other players will call me on it.  This is less formal than making them the arbiters of whether i swore enough or not, they are simply a check against abuse, as is the case in most games.<br/><br/>Now, if I codify a few behaviors as roleplaying - like speaking in character or describing things with color - then that's easy to plug into the rules, and rules like this already exist in some RPGs, from Over the Edge's 'Take a penalty if you're boring' disincentive to the incentive of stunt bonuses from Exalted and other systems.  Now, I would simplify it - exalted's system breaks in places because it's tiered, so there's also a question of how well you came up with stuff, and some arbitration on how good or bad it was, and that decision is non trivial. However, the decision of whether or not yo u did it at all is far more trivial.<br/><br/>So that's a start.  Now, you could jazz this up some, make the rest of the table a more active audience, have a robust fan mail style economy and such, but that has a basic fallacy in that it depends on the table as a whole being inclined to RP, and since we're depending upon rules, that's not much of a solution.<br/><br/>Anyway, what we have so far makes it easy to introduce roleplaying into a game. It adds funny voices and cool descriptions, and that may be all that's _really_ needed.  But my know it when I see it feels like this falls short because there is no depth to it.  There is nothing mandating any sort of continuity or connection between these bursts of roleplaying.<br/><br/>There's a definition of roleplaying which I , while far from comprehensive, covers a nice broad swath with the idea that roleplaying means making non-optimal mechanical choices to support your RP priorities. Now, what those priorities are can be hotly debated, so right now we will just call them doughnuts.  So when faced with the option to protect the queen or interrupt that mage's spellcasting, where interrupting the mage is a much smarter idea, I protect the queen because doughnuts are more important to me than that tactical advantage.  That is, in the abstract, an RP choice.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ways to take this, but at its simplest level, this is not hard to codify in any system where accomplishments can be measured.  Any time you can make an optimal choice, but you make a less optimal one for doughnuts, you get a cookie. Probably requires a bit more feedback from the table to check for bullshit, but for the most part, this is still pretty easy to judge. <br/><br/>But this is where it starts getting crazy, and the cracks in the big system show.  Doughnuts do not exist in a vacuum.  There is some rewards within the doughnut which the character is choosing over the optimized path, and every time he chooses the doughnut, he is promoting that agenda and moving towards that reward.  <br/><br/>Which suggests a parallel reward system exists (not unlike the practical/ethical split presented earlier in this) which is, to be frank, usually poorly systemized at best. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's the part that is usually the most dependent upon human behavior (since the doughnut is usually either an internal issue or tied to NPCs).  Now, such a system could be systemized - when I chose the doughnut, I get milk instead of cookies, and milk can be accumulated towards my larger, doughnut related goals. But if that system is too transparent, then it stops being about the doughnut, and becomes all about the Milk - the doughnut is just a means to an end, and since RP lies at the empty center of that doughnut, I have just overshot my goal of seeking roleplay, and come back down to a purely mechanical exercise, and I have to start all over again.<br/><br/>I don't know that this cycle is perpetually doomed, but it mostly suggests that roleplay is something give tools for, leave room for, then leave the hell alone after a certain point.<br/><br/>Now I'm hungry.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - Edited since I did not mean to put words in John's mouth. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137892/#Comment_137892" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:42:48+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:42AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, if the game doesn't use "characters" and still presents you with moral dilemma, you get an interesting thing, people arguing, shouting, being very much invested, but they're probably going to do it as themselves.<br/><br/>They are immersing themselves in the situation, but they are not playing any role other than their own, just like a political discussion.<br/><br/>I think this might be a good point to strive for, because it comes natural to most adults.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137895/#Comment_137895" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:44:46+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>When there is no interference, and both the expectation and context are present, people roleplay.</blockquote>\nGood catch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137898/#Comment_137898" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:50:49+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:50AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, it may be contested, what is "less optimal", in Taj Mahal for example, is it better to get the Commodities with the Elephants, or win one of the Moguls, in order to create a continuous territory?

If a choice is merely unclear, then there's no clear doughnut.  Of course, this is a fuzzy requirement - if I pass up the queen to take a pawn in chess, is it because I hate that pawn (mmm, doughnut), or is it because I'm setting up a better tactical move?   That can be argued round and round. Some of it self corrects, based on what your table calls bullshit on, but some rules just won't handle it well.<br/><br/>The other possibility that both clarifies and complicates matters are explicit doughnut pointers.   If I know before the game starts that i hate that pawn, then when I pass up the queen to take it, there's no question that I was going for the doughnut.  These pointers, whether they're flags or aspects or spiritual attributes or anything else, can be very helpful in directing play, but they run the risk of becoming milk, until I'm hitting the pointers for the payout, and _that_ is now the game I'm playing.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137908/#Comment_137908" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T11:13:13+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 11:13AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The couple of times I played Diplomacy, I naturally lapsed into a kind of roleplaying, because in order to win I have to DECEIVE and LIE to people.

There's a reason people spend time modding and painting to get their fig "just right" - if your Elven Archer wields a couple of little daggers, it just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Betrayal at House on the Hill made me roleplay a bit. It made the game much more fun. What helped bring about RP? I assumed it was the 1:1 relationship of the game with the SIS - you play a character who creeps through a house, adding room after room, exploring on their own if they're brave or along with others if they're not. Pretty much the only aspect which broke the illusion was the dreaded appearance of the Underground Lake on the 2nd floor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137930/#Comment_137930" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T12:08:42+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 12:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite><br/>Rob, that's a really strange and unimaginative way of looking at it.  What about "Sir Kay sallies to intercept a convoy of timber bound to form siege engines to array against Camelot!" and "I shall absent myself from the Lord's quest.  We must keep up the spirits of the peasants, thus I shall preside over a tournament.  What's this?  The Black Knight?!?!"  The stuff on the board is only representative of the conflict which is being described in the SIS - it's no stranger than dice or minis in a D&amp;D game.</blockquote>\nLevi nailed it, but I'll extrapolate a bit.  You and I and everyone here can jumpt to a pretty vivid image when we walk about going out to fight the siege engines, but they game provides me little knight pieces and little catapult pieces, and until I buy into the fiction strongly enough to turn those abstractions into something more concrete in my head, then they look a lot like catapults to me.<br/><br/>Let me contrast this with a game like, say, <i>En Garde</i> where cards played equate to fencing maneuvers.  That is easy to envision, so it's easy to buy into the fiction.  In contrast, SoC uses fairly generic currency, so any meaning I get from playing a card has to all come from me, and this is all predicated on the assumption that I'm not already inclined to do it.<br/><br/>It's actually a little odd because the action of spending cards to remove seige engines is probably the easiest to envision, since "The more fight cards i spend the harder I fight" is pretty easy to grasp but the manner it's represented on the board is super abstract.  On the other hand, the Picts and Saxons are presented on the board in a really compelling fashion, with them growing in numbers until they sweep down upon the kingdom.  But their method of resolution ("I can't stop them! I don't have a 3!") is exceedingly abstract.<br/><br/>Does that make any more sense?<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137933/#Comment_137933" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T12:13:53+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 12:13PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Betrayal at House on the Hill made me roleplay a bit.</blockquote>\nOooooo, good point and you've totally made me a liar in this discussion.  That's one game that I actually was motivated to do some roleplaying in.  It just felt right and was fun.  Half the group wasn't really digging it though so it trailed off, but with full participation by all, yes, that would be a nice rp boardgame.                        </div>\n<div

planning to write a post on my blog on the issue, and yes, while it is impossible to have a game that is inherently is an SG (I claim that every RPG is an SG, not every SG is an RPG), I want games whose mechanics drive SG, and make it more likely one will SG, perhaps we'll even one day reach a game that virtually all those who play it (even if they don't learn the "right way" to play it from the community) will RP/SG it.<br/><br/>I don't think we have such a game right now.<br/><br/>Edit: Correction, we have such SGs, but no such RPGs.                        </div>\n<div

I have played (non role playing) games where the rules demanded that I must speak in rhyme, or chant or otherwise behave oddly.  Sometimes this had additional mechanical teeth (lose a point if you don't rhyme, for example) but mostly you just did it because A) It's in the rules and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> The requirement is explicit an easily understandable.   B is where a lot of this stff falls down because it's not easy to come up with discrete, atomic parts of roleplay that don't suck.<br/><br/>If my game of Clue had a card that said "For the next minute, pretend you're professor plum and the person to your right is Miss Scarlet, try to get a confession from her!" then that would really just result in a minute of awkward silences and "Did you do it?".  If, instead, suppose it had a rule whereby, say, when you tell the table why you have motive to kill Mr. Boddy, you get a free turn, extra draw or something else.  That does not _mandate_ roleplaying ("He killed my father. Now gimme your cards."), but it creates an opportunity for  the player to spin a riff if they are so inclined.  It's a small thing, but it's not like the 14 year olds of the world picked up their copies of D&amp;D and instantly got the hang of this role playing thing anyway.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137966/#Comment_137966" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T14:33:12+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  2:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At what point does role-playing become <b>Role-playing</b>, anyway?<br/><br/>Mid-80s?

The game rules do not require input from people roleplaying.  Now, technically speaking, I don't think <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> requires roleplaying input, either.  As long as you're okay accepting the set up "your fighter and five other dudes are in this dungeon filled with monsters and loot," then there's nothing to stop you from playing without a single instance of roleplaying involved.  <br/><br/>However, take a look at, say, <em>Dogs</em> or <em>Sorcerer</em> or hell, <em>GURPS</em> -- you can't play these games without roleplaying.  The rules don't work unless they're "primed" with a fictional context and character motivations -- you start off <em>Dogs</em> with what you wanted to do while at the Temple.  You start off <em>Sorcerer</em> with the kicker.  Even the weakest case, GURPS -- you could run a move-and-hit sort of minis game using the GURPS rules, but you'd only be using a quarter of the rules.  In order to play the whole game, you must roleplay to generate context, and the mechanics use that context in their operation.<br/><br/>I don't buy the "non-optimal choices" definition, since in my gaming experience, I always make optimal choices -- optimized for very different goals, depending on which game I'm playing.  If I throw myself in front of the queen rather than stop that spellcaster, it's because I'm more interested in a story where my character throws herself in front of the queen than one where she stops the spellcaster.

Like the GM declares a balcony with a vase on it, I declare I push it, he declares it smashes on the cobble stones below. Or it could be an verbal exchange, were the GM declares a surly guard blocks the way, I declare my words with him, and the GM declares he lets us pass.<br/><br/>I think your refering to the interaction between statements as roleplay? Like, just declaring there's a surly guard and no one responding isn't roleplaying. Some interaction between statements has to occur for it to be roleplay?<br/><br/>In relation to your original question, can you see the vase push as the natural flow of events in a game world? And alternatively, can you also see it as nothing to do with physics in a game world, but a series of social pressures in the real world? Ie, it'll lower the GM's social standing briefly if he says the vase lands intact, cause everyone thinks that's out of wack and will think less of him for it. So the interaction is completely non physics based, it's all about the 'physics' of social standing.<br/><br/>Sorry it's a bit complicated, but many gamers can't see it's purely social based interaction. Their are stuck in some sort of dream state where they genuinely think it's an interaction of physics. I can't even help you if your stuck there, but this is the area where your answer lies I think. I'll write more once I know your answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138036/#Comment_138036" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T18:42:10+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  6:42PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Callan, I totally get that.  I've no interest in modeling some physical reality (for the purposes of this discussion, anyway).  I understand that we're dealing with real people, friends around a table, and their impulses rather than fiction.  <br/><br/>Here's how I'm going to apply what I've learned thusfar in this conversation:<br/><br/>I've got a really interesting game that is predicated on group decision-making, because it is players-against-the-game and the adversity is ratcheted up pretty high.  Everyone is playing a distinct character.  There is a crystal clear victory condition.<br/><br/>I've already observed, in playtest, that a huddle naturally occurs before each turn is initiated where a general strategy is agreed on between the players.  So I'm going to codify this and implement two changes:  <br/><br/>1.  I'll acknowledge this moment and require that it be conducted in character rather than casually between players.<br/><br/>2.

What are the implied negatives of parlor narration, and how can they be turned into positives?</blockquote>\nThere may be some room, but I don't think there's much.  The crux of the issue is the degree to which stuff that occurs in the SIS effects the players' decisions.  In a highly mechanized game like Shadows, there is no danger in ignoring the developments in the SIS and making decisions for purely mechanical reasons.  For instance, in my running example, there's no harm in ignoring the Saxons involvement in the siege because there is no mechanical impact for doing so.   There is some limited ability to overcome this, the next player could choose to add a siege engine to reflect the events, but because the game rolls so much of the adversity into the black deck it'd very difficult to tune your progression of evil to reflect events.<br/><br/>As far as making parlor narration a positive thing?  Well the negative is that the mechanical structure is fully functional without imagined input, so there's a disconnect between the two.  I suppose embracing it would allow you to create a game that is extremely mechanically tight but still allows for some degree of role playing.

But do they have to use English accents or wear Renwear or do a bunch of melodramatically hand-wringing, if the Ambassador? Not at all--in fact, the "roles" are so generalized that one could drift LLTK to any hierarchical organization: Mafia, Corporation, Priesthood, etc. And though the functional roles don't change one jot, the acting which one may or may not do would change radically. Or, again, could be totally ignored: Mafia LLTK with no Sicilian accents or bad suits; Color without reciprocated Acting.<br/><br/>The closest I've seen System come to actually enforcing role playing is Trait evocation in Dogs. And even then, it's enforced on the level of the social contract, by the players and GM calling BS on weak/invalid evocations or pushing each other to act-out the evocation, rather than just say, "OK, it's a gunfight; I evoke Sharpshooter 2d10." The Point of Play is that inter-player, social stroking of "cool narrative" and "wow" moments, when someone takes a boring Trait like Sharpshooter and evokes it into a seemingly inappropriate situation with no objections.<br/><br/>So think more about what it means to you, vis a vis what the <i>Point of Play</i> is for your new project. Do you want/have merely <i>functional roles</i> (goal-based identities; the "UN Ambassador to the US" mentioned above; the Brick fighter in a standard D&amp;D tactical grouping); or do you have mechanics which reinforce and/or reward <i>acted roles</i>?<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138154/#Comment_138154" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T11:07:22+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 11:07AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh... re-reading my post, I am reminded of the Mind/Body debate in metaphysics:<br/>Is acting epiphenomenal to roleplaying, or is it the "soul" which animates roleplaying and keeps it from being automoton behavior?<br/>"Proper" acting-driven roleplaying is Dualism; "encouraged" acting in roleplaying is Epiphenominalism; and "do it if it makes your dick hard" is Materialism, eschewing the necessity of the acting "soul" in RP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138156/#Comment_138156" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T11:20:19+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 11:20AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've gotten what I wanted out of this thread, but you guys can carry on if you like.

I don't want to go into discussions about avatarism, playing always yourself and turtling, but I have seen more GOOD role-playing in Author's stance than in Actor Stance.<br/><br/>And this was only an example. How it's possible to talk about pushing role-playing without saying WHAT IS role-playing? Do you mean play-acting? Do you mean going into deep immersion? Do you mean making sub-optimal choices?

Stance is something that happen in this moment, in the "now", and it's about the decision you take. I don't know any game where you can't play in actor stance not even once (not even monopoly. Nor chess. You can totally lose the queen making a bad move and say "oh, I did that because I wanted to talk a little with the bishop there"). By this criterion, every game is a rpg.<br/><br/>And if you meant a game where you can play ALWAYS in actor stance... well, D&amp;D wouldn't be a rpg (the character don't know what hp are and how many he has left, for example)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138225/#Comment_138225" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T15:06:23+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  3:06PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2008 3:07PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I don't know any game where you can't play in actor stance not even once (not even monopoly.</blockquote>\nI've seen author stance dictated as "how you speak" in a few off-the-cuff little games, almost all of them purely net-based (and, yes, I'm gonna go try and dig one up here, so I can point at it and ALSo to doublecheck if I'm remembering correctly).<br/><br/>I've also seen the reverse, but only once - and that was in Puppetland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138255/#Comment_138255" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T19:27:18+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  7:27PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>My hope is the frisson of competing personal win conditions, the natural impulse to hash out what to do next tactically, and a mandate to do that hashing out in character will have the desired effect of adding meaningful and interesting interaction.</blockquote>\nAre you saying the hashing out in character will be meaningful and interesting?<br/><br/>Or are you saying it will make something that is meaningful and interesting?

I'm also very tired and out of it, so I hope this post makes sense to somebody. I'm just going to brainstorm a little...<br/><br/>One way to force/encourage roleplaying (however you want to define it) is to design your game in one of two ways:<br/><br/>1. The game is not fun unless you roleplay.<br/><br/>Make sure the game doesn't provide anything that's fun, fulfilling, or challenging on its own. I think GURPS would be a good example of this (with the possible exception of character creation). If you're not roleplaying, what are you doing? There's no other real activity in there.<br/><br/>2. Doing stuff in the game (i.e. interacting with the rules/system) does not make sense or cannot be communicated to the other players without roleplaying.<br/><br/>Examples include games like "It's Complicated" or maybe a game where you combine names or elements, with the result creating some sort of narrative structure. For instance, you combine fragments of sentences together to tell a story.<br/><br/>--If there's nothing to do in play except create and enjoy the imaginary "stuff", then that's what people will do, or they won't play the game. (Again, this is like the GURPS example.)<br/>--If important decisions must be made during play, and cannot be made without roleplaying, people will have to roleplay. (This is like the Dogs example--the rule is that the narration must make sense, which can only be judged within some sort of roleplaying-like context.)<br/><br/>One example might be some kind of advanced tactical combat rules (as one would find in, say, GURPS). If you try to play out a combat, you'll HAVE to define who's involved, possibly where they are. If someone takes a "trip" maneuver, or a "knee to the groin" maneuver, you begin to define some fictional space where stuff is happening. Someone has just been tripped, or kneed, or whatever. Some made-up story is taking shape.<br/><br/>Second example: Imagine you're playing a game where one of the things you can do is spend some sort of points for a bonus. But the rule is: you are only allowed to spend those points if the target of your action is someone your character is in love with. If the player wants to spend those points, the group first has to decide who those two people are, and whether one is in love with the other. This is roleplaying if your definition of roleplaying is something like. "making decisions for, or about, a fictional character and their actions/beliefs".<br/><br/>The other thought this brings us for me is:<br/><br/>If you can make some rules (a subsystem of the game, for instance) that is just plain _interesting_, that may motivate players to roleplay. If something is cool enough that they want to try it, but they can't without making up some characters, situation, etc, then they'll have to, won't they? For this to work, you have to make sure that some aspects of the imaginary stuff are necessary for the rules--for instance, your game has some detailed Car Chase mechanics. But, before the race starts, you have to decide, "Is the ground wet?" "Does the driver hate the driver in front of him?" If that determines how the rules will interact, you're well on the way to roleplaying/story gaming. <br/><br/>Do you know what I mean? Have you ever picked up a game in an RPG shop, and just thought, "those Space Combat rules sound cool! I've got to try them!"<br/><br/>Note that for something like my example, above, to work, it should probably be explicit that those important decisions have to "stick" and can't just be changed nilly-willy. For instance, imagine playing Monopoly with an optional rule that you can avoid paying rent if your character hates the character who owns that street/hotel. But the decision has to stick for the rest of the game, or until some other rule comes into play and changes it. If the argument between the two characters involves some stuff that is not hard-coded into the rules, but important for their adjudication, I think it would be hard to avoid roleplaying (at least by some definitions). For instance, the rule could be, "describe your character's belongings, and how they were acquired. The other player can pick any number of belongings and describe how his character now owns them." For it to work, the belongings then have to tie back into the regular game.<br/><br/>Yeah, crappy example. But it's just for the sake of illustration.<br/><br/>(Again, apologies for the late night posting. I hope I don't read this tomorrow and realize I came off like some lunatic.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138270/#Comment_138270" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T23:28:22+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 11:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/4/4/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2008/20080404.jpg"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138277/#Comment_138277" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T00:53:13+00:00" title="April  5, 2008 12:53AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's talk specifics.<br/><br/>These games are rpgs, or not, and why?

What do you mean with "a story is told"? By who? Who wrote that story? When? And there is always the old problem: what is a "story"? Monopoly has a story? The Sim? Super Mario Bros.? <br/><br/>And what do you mean with "playing a role"? Play-acting? Talking in the first person? playing in actor's stance? And how much? All the time? At least once in an entire session? At least once in a series o sessions? At least a certain percentage of the time?<br/><br/>They are all useful term when you talk with someone about something you have a common shared understanding ("I recognize it when I see it") and you both know what do you mean with "story games", but they are TERRIBLE terms to use in a definition, because they are not defined in the first place...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138296/#Comment_138296" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T06:36:38+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  6:36AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, I'd call all of those roleplaying games, although I did have a memorable session of <i>Contenders </i>that played like a tactical card game and remained fun.

I mean, When I say Story-Game, I personally mean  "A game in which the players can focus on authoring" - and, usually, that's just a subset of a roleplaying game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138499/#Comment_138499" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T07:22:00+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:22AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2008 7:26AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I lament that it appears as if the essay that I linked to in the last page is not being read. That, or, worse, it's not interesting. I lament, because it means that I have to get off my lazy ass and participate in this important thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny attempt to disinclude any form of RPG, as a way to define what RPGs are, is simply the individual showing their biases. That is, the usual way to define something is to say it is X, Not Y. Well that's simply not going to work for RPGs, and I think that we should avoid it. The definition of RPG is:<br/>\n<br/>\nA whole lot of things that are done as an activity, some of which are present in RPG play somewhere, but none of which are present in all RPG play. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre fungi plants, or mono-cellular organisms acting as colonies? Does it matter? They are what they are, and we call them plants sometimes, because they have some, but not all, features of plants. <br/>\n<br/>\nWargamey play of D&amp;D is RPG play. To say it's not is like me saying that my father is not a Holmes, becuase he doesn't have some qualities that I do. Rather disrespectful, no, given that he gave me both life and the name. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when Wick talks about non-tactical decision-making, he's wrong to call this definititve. What he *has* done is to indentify one aspect of RPG play that is somewhat unique RPG play, where it occurs. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what's useful, identifying qualities of RPG play. I think that you can find value in discovering the various interesections of these qualities, and therin lies your "definition." <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such Monopoly, played with roles, is a role-playing game in that it hits on one feature of RPG play. Not strongly a RPG, no. But that's the sort of language we need to use. We need to say, RPG activity type X has these RPG features, but not these others. Like "CRPGs allow you to play a single character, but do not allow you mechanical ability to perform any action you can think of (like TTRPGs do), but only those that the computer is set up to resolve." <br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, to follow up on recent posts, "Story-game" means RPG play where there's less focus on playing individual characters, and more on collaboration to create a story. One form of RPG play. Distinct from Tabletop RPG play only internally. Just as LARP is distinct from TTRPGs, and they are distinct from CRPGs, but they are all RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say nothing else this thread, I hope that everybody gets this idea. Don't define RPGs by exclusion, define them by shared  (but not requried) qualities. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138509/#Comment_138509" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T07:51:20+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:51AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe we should define some names for the different "kinds" of RPGs, to better explain the kind of game we are talking about ("Dingoes and Dustpans?

No, no, it isn't a Z...")<br/><br/>And I think that the basis for some useful distinction would be our old friends, the Creative Agendas categories... after all, one way they are explained is usually with the ball metaphor: different people at different times can use a ball for different kind of games. And all these talks about playing the same game with some definition ("you have to make not-optimal choices") or others ("you should be able to play it in actor stance") for "role-playing" make me think of that game more like a ball than like a ball game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138519/#Comment_138519" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T08:07:47+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  8:07AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love that PA strip--I used to "RP" Magic the Gathering and Jyhad (V:TES) all the time, often to the chagrin of the grognard in the group who would say I wasn't "playing to win" with my theme decks and table-talk.<br/><br/>We need a working definition of role playing, to begin to Yeah or Nay a laundry list of games. Given the lack of success at RPG.net to define "LARP" as distinct from improv or cops &amp; robbers, we might be looking for that semantic corral for quite a while. Not saying it's a bad idea, but (sort of as Mike said above) it needs to be heavily parsed and delineated from similar, but non-RP, activities. Definitions are tough, and bad ones come in two general categories: too narrow (over-sttrict, necessitates new terms to deal with special or corner cases) or too general (liberal, permissive, could include activities that few or none would call RP).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138539/#Comment_138539" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T09:46:32+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  9:46AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Moreno, what if we distinguish between "Story-Games", which are games where during the course of play a story is told, and "Role-playing games", where you are playing a role?</blockquote>\nTo my mind, these blur into each other pretty hard...

The way I have always seen it played, there is no imagined events that the group is agreeing on, or at least no significant imagined events (people may be picturing actual streets, houses, hotels, and whatnot in their minds), so I don't see the game as an RPG, and I don't see the Lumpley Principle in action.<br/><br/>Really absorbing the Lumpley Principle has helped me figure out just what is was that made D&amp;D different from any other game I had played before. Once I played D&amp;D, I did look back into my play and see some play that might be considered role play, though no formal "game rules" were in use. More recently, I can read the descriptions of things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wesely" rel="nofollow">Braunstein</a> and see that it sounds like the Lumpley Principle was likely in force there and thus role play.<br/><br/>But perhaps I'm also looking for something a bit more than just the Lumpley Principle. I expect that the imagined events and the agreeing have to be significant to the outcome of play, and that they need to be more than just a thin covering over the shell of the mechanics. So just having some imagination making Monopoly more than just pawns circling the board governed by the roll of dice and a simple set of rules with the players passing play money about also governed by relatively simple set of rules does not rise to the level of role play unless the imagination actually affects the outcome of the game (which probably would require something like the players agreeing that because imaginary event A happened, rule B is interpreted differently).<br/><br/>I still can't articulate myself to satisfaction, but the Lumpley Principle allows me to articulate role play a lot better than I used to be able to.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138588/#Comment_138588" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T14:23:20+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  2:23PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2008 2:24PM by Josh Roby.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Paul (and JBR), I like your distinctions.  Can you lay out an example/thought experiment that is as minimalist as you can imagine but still meets your personal "know it when I see it" definition of roleplaying?</blockquote>\nTo recap, my thesis is that a roleplaying game is a game in which roleplaying (ie creating a shared fiction in which you play a role) is <em>required</em> in order for the game to function.  Thus, Monopoly is not a roleplaying game because, while you <em>can</em> create a shared fiction and play a role in it, you can play the game perfectly well without doing so.  My thesis is stance-neutral: whether or not you spend most or all of your time on Author, Actor, or Director stance is irrelevant.  You have a role, you play it, and playing that role is essential to the game function.<br/><br/>As for a minimalist thought experiment... as minimalist as I can get is the most basic forum-based roleplaying sites, where you have a statless character and a few guidelines on what you can and can't say about your actions and others' responses (there are far more elaborate roleplaying fora out there; this characterization is not representative of forum-based roleplaying as a whole).  In such a case, the only rules that exist might dictate that you can say what your character does or attempts to do, but you may not say how other characters react.  All by itself, that rule is dead.  It requires the input of roleplaying in order to become meaningful -- you need your character in a situation involving one or more other characters, and some interaction between them.  Once you have that, the rule has meaning.<br/><br/>Or, to take a more complicated example, consider Sorcerer, the rules of which are highly dependent on the fictional context in which they are employed.  I've only got a handful of stats, and they're hugely abstract -- Stamina, Will, Lore, Cover.  I simply can't roll these stats in a conflict without setting up a fictional situation first.  You need a set up -- okay, so there's a guy in a flowing cloak about to hit the big red button -- before anybody can say, "I grab the guy's cloak and yank him back from the button -- I'll roll Stamina."<br/><br/>Making sense?<br/><br/>And, um, fungi aren't plants.

The orc is not a box on a board in front of you (i.e. an objective fact that you can directly perceive) it is an imaginary element of an imaginary world. No matter how much of a pawn stance you are taking your *pawn* is still an agreed imaginary entity without which your action is meaningless.

With enough objective detail in the form of miniatures, squares, distances and the like it is possible to have a simulation that does not involve that imaginative space, or does not predicate it for taking meaningful actions. <br/><br/>For example I can play a tabletop wargame, with miniatures, and scenery and distances, and not require an imaginative space for my actions to be interpreted in. I can do everything in terms of where the miniatures can physically be moved, what line of sight I can draw with a ruler, how big a gap is with a tape measure and so on. I can say "This unit attacks your unit with it's cannon attack" and be talking entirely in terms of the physical objects we are using to play. It does not matter that they represent a bunch of men in some abstract sense, that is not a level which I need to play the game.<br/><br/>On the other hand I can play that same battle as a roleplaying game and make actions and judgements that rely on the reality of the SIS for their justification. I can say that a unit wouldn't advance because it's members are nervous and scared, or that a model will break away from his men because he hates the opposing commander for killing his brother and wants revenge, or that I should get a +1 bonus on my dice roll because these men come from a hilly country like the one we are fighting in and are more used to the terrain than the soldiers marched in from the plains. These sorts of moves / rules / judgements make no sense without the SIS and the elements in it. It doesn't matter that I am in Director or Pawn stance, I am still breaking away from what is physical and in front of me as the basis for my judgements and actions.<br/><br/>And of course you *can* do that in Monopoly, but it would be at the point where you move beyond the rules given for moving pieces around the board, and start talking about defaulting on loans, or going on the run, or burning down people's hotels, or anything else that makes sense in the context of the SIS but is not actually an element of the mechanics involved in playing the board game.<br/><br/>A roleplaying game, then, would be something that attempts to give some sort of mechanics to the actions that you take in the SIS, rather than in the real world, to the point where you can abbandon real world mechanics entirely if you want (as the game moves from a board game, to a board game with RP, to an RPG), If you can't take meaningful actions outwith the internal logic of the SIS then you are playing an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140307/#Comment_140307" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T06:52:26+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  6:52AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still sounds like fuzzy-headed special snowflakeism to me.<br/><br/>Know what I think?

But I don't think of this as a SIS phenomenon. I think of it as that quality discussed earlier where we're allowing for that "infinity" of actions, not just the ones defined by specific game options. Which quality requires player (usually GM) judgement to allow to happen. Note that I think that this can be done without a SIS at all, with the criteria being opaque, or even being ones like plausibility or realism. Take, for instance, Chris Engel's "Matrix Games" which are wargames wherin there are few mechanics, and your chances of victory come down, mostly, to how well the GM thinks your plan would work given the situation as presented. These are played without any of the other accoutrement of RPGs... certainly no first person portrayal or narration per se, just measures of success in terms of men lost, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is to say that I find Matrix Games to be very borderline. Yes, they do have that one element that's unique to RPGs, but I don't think they really have SIS in the fashion that we mean, or other elements we associate with RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, moreover, I've seen lots of RPG play where meaningful actions were taken without paying any attention to the SIS. That is actions that got characters dead or wounded, for instance, that didn't pay any attention to the fact that, for instance, my character couldn't have known about the fight in the next room, but came running into it anyhow, because I as a player knew (this is what leads GMs to feel they have to pass notes or take players into other rooms). <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, sure, that's not a RPG to you. But it was to the people playing at the time. Heck, they actually did do some first-person portrayal ("roleplaying"). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in reference to Bob's point, and to reiterate what I've said above, if this is about identity politics, who cares? The only reason to identify what RPGs are, is to be able to discuss their qualities, and, perhaps, what can make them better. This is why exclusionary definitions are meaningless. They all boil down to the person saying, "Well that's not how I like to roleplay, so I'm hoping that if we define it as such that those other annoying folks will call what they do something else, and everybody can see that my way to play is the right way to do roleplaying." <br/>\n<br/>\nSay, instead, "that's not what I want out of RPG play, though I understand it's a valid form of RPG play for others." And then let's catalogue all of this stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example, the majority of the play of World of Warcraft (myself, for instance), does not have a SIS at all. But it does have "avatarism." Which, I think, qualifies it as what it claims to be a mmoRPG. Is it the same as other RPGs? It's very different. But they're still recognizably the same general category of activity. All without making Monopoly a RPG, either. <br/>\n<br/>\n(For some context on "Avatarism" check this out: http://ptgptb.org/0020/coop.html <br/>\nThe salient parts are near the end. I can't find the original "Avatarism and the Myth of the Red Queen" essay, unfortunately. If anyone knows where I can, please link it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140310/#Comment_140310" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T07:16:51+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  7:16AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny.

Everything that's relevant, everything that's significant, is on the board, has a little figurine, or is counted on a character sheet.  You don't <em>need</em> to imagine moss on the walls in order for the game to work.  In fact, if you do imagine moss on the walls, it never impacts the rules of the game (which is different than impacting your decisions).<br/><br/>Contrast with even the most sparse D&amp;D game, where, say, the combat set pieces are interspersed with travel between them, or resting and talking between characters, or even in-character tactical discussions.  I would say that if you are taking the D&amp;D rule set and only using the bits which are relevant to tactical combats, then no, you are no longer playing an RPG, and you are not playing D&amp;D -- you're playing parts of D&amp;D.  It's like the difference between Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Tactics.<br/><br/>And, contrariwise, you could totally break out the HeroQuest board game and create some at-the-table group-consensus unspoken house rules that introduce ways in which the SIS affect the rules of the game and the options available to you -- but then you are no longer just playing HeroQuest; you're playing Our Homebrew RPG That Uses HeroQuest, and you've made yourself a roleplaying game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140329/#Comment_140329" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T10:43:17+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 10:43AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2008 10:55AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the first games of D&amp;D were not D&amp;D until Gary perked up and said, "My character isn't going in there because he doesn't like moss?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we saying that the definition of RPGs was "wargame" for about ten minutes? And has since changed? I know that some of you find it hard to believe, but a lot of D&amp;D play occurs that is indistinguishable from play of the MB Heroquest game, and which doesn't contradict any rules in doing so. Clyde and I played in such a game at Origins... last year? Year before? The DM actually told us specifically, in fact, "there will be no roleplaying." So... that wasn't D&amp;D? Or not "D&amp;D the RPG?" but "D&amp;D the Miniatures Game." <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that characters "travelled" between dungeons simply did not exist in OD&amp;D. Any more than the idea that the characters in Monopoly have to travel to see the properties they're buying. Simply... didn't... exist... There was no "world," only the dungeon that the characters were currently in. When "Town" got introduced, it was a mechanic that explained that characters mechanically had the opportunity to get new equipment, and got their hit points back. And it was pretty notional, really only the mechanics were introduces, with "town" as a rationale. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of this sort of play not being a RPG being? Again, you must also then feel that WOW is not a RPG when played this way (which I'd argue is how the stubstantial majority of people play it)?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust having one character with whom you may associate, even if it's just as a projection of yourself... that's not part of RPGs? Or not enough to make a game a RPG if it's alone? MMORPG is an incorrect label? Again, sure, some people "roleplay" in WoW, but it's facilitated no moreso than doing so in Monopoly. Or, if you prefer, Unreal. In both, however, you have an avatar. In WoW, you care about the avatar (because of the investment), in Unreal you do not, it's death is only an expression of your loss, and you soon have another again that is undamaged. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140335/#Comment_140335" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T11:06:55+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 11:06AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>So the first games of D&amp;D were not D&amp;D until Gary perked up and said, "My character isn't going in there because he doesn't like moss?"</blockquote>\nMiiiiiiiiiiiiike.  Not about player choices.  Not about player choices.  Not about player choices.  I'm not even asking for charitable reading, here; I'm asking for reading.  When the SIS pipes back into the mechanics, you have a roleplaying game.  That <em>may</em> constrain player choices, but not necessarily.  By no means am I saying, or have ever said, that players making choices based on the SIS and not their tactical interest makes it a roleplaying game. I think that definition is silly, simple-minded, and flat-out wrong.<br/><br/>And for reference:<br/><br/><em>Yes,</em> the definition of RPGs was "wargame" for about ten minutes.  I think that's pretty much an assumed given at this point -- we all understand that RPGs (at least of the D&amp;D derivation) were an outgrowth of wargames, and at some point in that transition, yeah, I'm sure there was grey areas.  I also don't think "wargame" and "roleplaying game" are mutually exclusive terms, for that matter.<br/><em>Yes,</em> a lot of D&amp;D play is indistinguishable from the HeroQuest board game.  Just because they're using stuff from the D&amp;D rulebook does not mean they're playing a roleplaying game -- in the exact same way that playing a game where one player has all four knights and the other player has all the pawns is no longer "chess."  <em>Chess</em> is a set of rules, and an incomplete subset of those rules is <em>not chess</em>.  Same goes for D&amp;D.<br/><em>Yes,</em> when you sit down for a game of D&amp;D and the DM says there will be no roleplaying... then you are not playing a roleplaying game.  If you sat down to play Monopoly and someone declared that you'd be playing without the board, you wouldn't be playing a board game, either.<br/><em>Yes,</em> World of Warcraft is not an RPG when played purely to show off how badass you and your l33t rogue skizillz are after you've had the level 70s in your guild escort you through every instance in the game and found your optimal gear choices on thottbot.com and never read the quest descriptions, just the objectives (and spam the channel asking where to find X when it's right there in your quest log).  And <em>that's perfectly fine</em> (except for the channel spam).  WoW is a toybox, and you can use the pieces to play an RPG and you can use the pieces to play a virtual bloodsport.

It is a roleplaying game insomuch as it is a game where you are playing a role.<br/><br/>A "strong" roleplaying game is one in which you <em>must</em> roleplay in which the action of roleplaying is an essential and required ingredient to making the game work in the first place.  It is a roleplaying game because it is a game <em>about</em> roleplaying, not just in which roleplaying happens.<br/><br/>Neh?<br/><br/>Of course, the corrolary: weak and strong ballgames, like baseball (strong ballgame, requires ball to play) and Monopoly (weak ballgame, does not require a ball to play, but you can roll one around on the board if you so choose).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140339/#Comment_140339" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T11:17:11+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 11:17AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, a virtual blizzard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140343/#Comment_140343" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T11:24:12+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 11:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2008 11:26AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>Paul (and JBR), I like your distinctions. Can you lay out an example/thought experiment that is as minimalist as you can imagine but still meets your personal "know it when I see it" definition of roleplaying?</blockquote>\nJason,<br/><br/>It's really hard for me to draw a line between RPGs and non-RPGs, but I _can_ produce a thought experiment that illustrates what I think would definitely be an RPG.<br/><br/>Consider a game where you, as the player, have to make choices (especially mechanical) choices that have nothing to do with strategy, win/lose, etc, but are based purely on what you prefer or find more interesting. For instance, at the outcome of some kind of roll, you can choose whether you want to take two points of Category A or five points of Category C, <i>knowing that neither gives you an advantage over the other</i>. In that kind of situation, your choice will be completely meaningless, and thus completely uninteresting, unless you and the other players attach some other kind of meaning to those Categories. <br/><br/>Unless you, the players, add some kind of fiction framework on top of those rules, they are meaningless and boring, and no one will want to play. That's what we do when we say, "will you choose to let your grandmother die, or would you rather not get the money?" That's when roleplaying gets interesting, for me, and how I see Vincent Baker's thoughts about System coming into the picture. We've attached meaning to something that wasn't meaningful before, and then played through a System that makes it impossible for us to get both at the same time... creating something interesting.<br/><br/>Keys from TSOY are another example. You really can't use them in any meaningful way without "roleplaying", I think (see below). You have to create imaginary content and characters for them to make sense. That puts TSOY firmly in the roleplaying camp, from this point of view.<br/><br/>Now, thinking about it that way kind of drives home how pointless many of these definitions are. But I would say, hesitantly, that a game which simply doesn't make sense without fictional content definitely HAS to be at least somewhat RPG-like. I would say that GURPS qualifies for this category, but there are some RPGs that do not.<br/><br/>Personally, the more I think about it, the more fond I am of Vincent's concept that what makes something an RPG is when the fictional stuff affects the rules/mechanics and players' choices. He has this little diagram with people, rules, and the fiction, with arrows going from one to the other, which illustrates this on "anyway". In other words, as soon as you say that you refuse to buy a certain property in Monopoly because your little pawn is allergic to antique furniture, you're in RPG land. I think I'm cool with that.<br/><br/>However, there is another factor muddying this discussion. That's the very term: "roleplaying". "Roleplaying" is an English word, with a certain meaning, and we're trying to apply in a few different ways. Literally, the word means "playing a role". But we've sort of extended it to include stuff like "creating fictional content", "creating story", etc. <br/><br/>I think that, to discuss this at all, those things have to get disentangled. If I'm playing Universalis, or even playing My Life with Master, but purely from director stance, I'm not really "roleplaying" (in the English sense of the word). But I AM doing something similar to D&amp;D in the sense that I'm doing something with imaginary characters and a SIS and all that. And what about games which are definitely RPGs (imaginary settings, etc), but where you play yourself? I think a person on the street would still call that "roleplaying", even though you're not playing the role of *a different person*.<br/><br/>And that's another interesting point: from that perspective, perhaps the way you play the game is really more important than what the game actually is, what its rules are, etc.<br/><br/>(edited to add:)<br/><br/>Let's see: a group of people is playing Monopoly. One of them, unlike all the others, is imagining his persona in his head, and silently explaining everything that happens in the game and how it relates to this persona's choices and feelings. Is this person roleplaying? Even if they don't say a single word aloud, except for "I move forward five spaces"? Is the group engaged in the activity of a roleplaying game? <br/><br/>Can we sit down together, as a group, and do something together, but where YOU are roleplaying but I am not?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140344/#Comment_140344" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T11:24:15+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 11:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshhhhhhhh.

I'm asking for you to read, if not charitably, intuitively. I don't have time to say, "That's just an example, and not one that indicates that I think that Josh's definition lies right at this point." <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now you've made me do more work than that anyhow. Thanks. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that you're saying that those other sorts of play aren't inferior, but you still are insisting on claiming that they aren't RPG play. Even when you also agree that there's "grey areas." All I'm saying is that, yeah, some areas are grey, and that, instead of looking at any one element as definitive of RPGs, that it's best to say, "RPGs tend to have investment in the SIS that affects play" or whatever version you'd like. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying that David has not identified an important element in RPG play, one that, perhaps, many players feel is definitive for them. I'm just saying that you're going to have to convince a whole lot of people playing WoW - more than probably play all TTRPGs put together - that their activity is mislabeled. Rather, you won't feel a need to do so, but the question is whether or not there's some utility in NOT looking at all at WoW play. Sure, I'm agreeing up and down that we shouldn't look at Monopoly play much, if at all. But I think a definition that rejects MMORPG play isn't doing us a lot of good. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain better to note the differences. So, for instance, we might be able to work on bridging forms, perhaps. Or whatever else might come from it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've restated this several times now, and I'm not sure if doing so again will improve my position. I may not be stating it well somehow, or maybe I'm just plain wrong.

I think that HeroQuest is a good simulation of the actions of an RPG, but without being one.<br/><br/>So you can play HeroQuest, move around a dungeon, fight things, collect treasure, as a simulation of what people are doing when Roleplaying, but without it being an RPG, because there is no SIS, or there is an SIS but it has no effect on the choices you make, because the choices are all about the rules of the board game. You can listen at a door only because HeroQuest has a rule for that (or is that the more recent D&amp;D game?) not because you think that it's plausible that monsters make noise and your character might be able to hear it. <br/><br/>In the board game you are restricted to what the rules specifically state you can do, but in an RPG you can move beyond that, imagining the situation, and then inferring from that something that should be possible and then acting on that. Then because of that inference you can enlarge that imaginary situation and make actions that are justified by it. It's a feedback situation, both being able to imagine beyond what you are presented with, then acting on that in a way that feeds back into the SIS and enlarges it further are crucial.<br/><br/>So you can imagine the moss on the walls in a game of HQ, but you can't change the action of the game based on that imagining. If you could, if you could take the moss, and make it into a poultice, or use it to find a source of underground water, or scrape it off and find something underneath, and that had an effect on the course of the game, then you would have moved into RPG territory for me, because you are taking actions that are justified only by what is happening in the SIS and also alter it.<br/><br/>That's part of what I was trying to get at above, but not all of it. You can Roleplay (as opposed to playing an RPG) without that feedback, I think, by creating an imagined character who has motivations for what he is doing beyond the motives of the game you are playing. That's the difference between "I hit the orc to defeat it, move ahead in the game, get more treasure and win" and "I hit the orc because it is a horrible monster and I hate it"<br/><br/>(And Mike, I apologize for being fuzzy, I am reaching for something here, but I am not sure I have the words to describe it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140354/#Comment_140354" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T11:45:44+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 11:45AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

That is, this is likely why RPGs went from being "wargames" to RPGs. There's something elemental about Avatarism (without, again, making it definitive to me). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's why some people would claim that Universalis is not a RPG. See, there we have people claiming single ownership of character as the "without which it is not a RPG." <br/>\n<br/>\nSo which definition do we use? Yours? Why not the avatar definition, and exclude Universalis? Because that limit doesn't fit your preferences? It has been the definition for others who play RPGs. Why do *you* get to decide? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument that a role-playing game is a RPG because it has role-playing in it, and then defining role-playing locally is a circular argument. Petito principi. Your definition is nigh tautological. You might as well ask why Zebra Mussels are called that if they don't have four legs. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion is not that *I* have the right definition, but that, they're all wrong, where they're exclusive. Because they do a disservice to the discussion by eliminating discussion of these things. If you say, "Ah, but I don't mind talking about such play, too" then why have the definition at all? What are you going to do with your definition? What's the use of it? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it's better to look at the relationships between all of these elements and how they combine in different ways to make RPGs or even "RPG-like" play, in order to see where we can go with it. Where will it lead? I can only speculate that it may be interesting. In fact I've already done some thinking on it, and it's been fascinating. In fact, I'd argue that any meta-thought about RPG play that doesn't think about these things is likely to be sterile. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul, I think it's missing from almost every RPG. That is I can imagine almost any RPG as being played without any imaginative elements at all. Odd as that might sound. Acually Universalis is actually pretty strong in the "requires narration" or at least "creation" department, because it's hard (though not impossible" to imagine play like: <br/>\n<br/>\nI purchase Component A. It has traits numbered 1 through 4. It now attempts to create a change in component B, so we have a complication. I get dice for all traits 1 through 4... how do you have a basis for challenging this?

There are lots and lots of discussions about lots and lots of things.  For some of these discussions, where the topic is games in general, or fantasy games, or games where you have a dude you control (your avatarism thing), then World of Warcraft is absolutely a relevant part of that discussion.  However, for discussions about <em>roleplaying</em> and how <em>roleplaying is used in a game</em>, WoW has as much a place as Monopoly.  If we're talking about, for instance, regulating player contributions to the fiction so that everybody is included, then we'll be talking about <em>PTA</em> and <em>Capes</em> and other roleplaying games.  WoW is not relevant there -- because it's not a roleplaying game.  It does not employ roleplaying as any sort of tool or feature, and it does not support nor gain support from roleplaying.

But I still need to affirmatively say; This is still calling roleplay a 'part', as if it's a physical thing that does (or doesn't) plug into the game somehow.<br/><br/>What facilitates roleplay isn't the game, it's the other person suggesting that you both roleplay in it. If you think GURPS is a roleplay game, but the other person you intend to play with has in no way suggested it's a roleplay game, you can't roleplay. Well, you can roleplay with yourself alone, but not with him, he's just fiddling with charts. See how roleplay isn't an integral part of GURPS/the game? If the other player wont suggest that you roleplay, poof, RP is gone. This can remove RP from any RPG ever conceived. It's the other persons suggestion of RP that matters. Roleplay isn't an inherant part/component of a game, it's all in the other persons suggestion that you roleplay.<br/><br/>On a tangental note, I think that's the problem your having with Mike - you wont suggest roleplaying in WOW, so poof, roleplay is gone. It's a bit of a self forfilling profesy to say there's no roleplay in it - it means you wont suggest RP - and it's because you chose not to suggest it, that is why RP isn't possible (except for the other person doing some solo RP).<br/><br/>Or to sum up in brief - with ANY roleplay game, if I chose not to see it as a roleplay game - POOF, you can't roleplay in it with me (err, again, except for solo RP on your part).<br/><br/>Well, that's my wrap up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140748/#Comment_140748" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T20:58:32+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  8:58PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread was messing with my head.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: steven807</cite>Some academics (e.g. George Lakoff, _Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things_) are noting that creating definitions that try to completely encompass a set is a futile act -- it's not the way people use language. Consider "mother": apparently a simple word. But can you define it cleanly? It is possible to describe someone as a "mother" who did not give birth to a child, or did not raise a child, or did not emotionally support a child; although probably not all three. "Female" seems to be required, though.<br/><br/>Instead, it's worth thinking about "prototypical" versions of something (e.g. a prototypical mother would give birth, raise, and support a child). There are set members which are not prototypical (an ostrich is definitely a bird, but not a prototypical bird), and there are items which are not clearly in or out of a set (sometime in history, there was something like a pterodactyl was that neither a bird, nor a non-bird)...<br/></blockquote>\nJust to bring Steven's comment back into this - because in my discipline of psychology, exclusionary definitions of categories seem not to model how the mind handles differences - we do tend to use prototypes. In certain fields, logic and hard science for example, exclusionary definitions are workable - but in this case, I expect exclusionary definitions are unlikely to shed much light or deliver much insight.

But, to be clear, the game I referenced which I played with Clyde at Origins was not the miniatures game, but D&amp;D 3.5, and it was played intentionally without any "roleplaying" where the statement was meant to mean the commonly accepted meaning of the term, that being that there would be no first-person portrayal. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've played the miniatures game, too. There's no question in anybody's mind that that game is a wargame. But part of the reason there's no question is because the avatarism factor is missing... you have an army, not a character. In point of fact, I have a friend who's working on a "D&amp;D Miniatures RPG" in which you play the leader of the army, and "advancement" is getting more figs into your army. And that game would, knowing the author, have very little, if any, "roleplaying" in the sense of first-person portrayal. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem, however, is with this definition of the term role-playing. It's assumed to mean "act the role of my character" in the sense of stage acting. But this was not it's original meaning, I don't think. The original meaning was the avatar thing... I "play" or "run" one role in the game. My character is the fighter, that's his role. We are playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I'm also sure that there was a sense that the play-acting could come in, and hence why it might make sense to use the term role-playing to mean something like it's use in Psychology, which was probably it's biggest use before RPGs. But even then, that's less "inhabit the role" as "show what the role would do." <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point being that simply making the decisions for a single character is, or was "role-playing." And, for many, that hasn't changed. It's only the whole "Roll-playing vs Role-playing" dichotomy in RPG play that causes us to have the bias against that sort of play as being role-playing at all. Instead of just seeing it as a different creative agenda. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is still exploraton in avatarism-only forms of play. What if I have my WoW character go into Magister's Terrace by himself, armed only with his invisibility spell (result, he gets killed, fast)? What are the limits of a single character? In fact, when we play them with others, what are the synergies our character brings to different groups? Exploration of system done from the point of view of a single character who's success I closely equate my own to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I see these attempts at defining RPG by relying on a local definition of role-playing (even if common) to be be tautological, and pointless. We agree that discussing these "related forms" is valuable. So nobody has been able to explain to me why it's important to disclude them for some reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140809/#Comment_140809" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T09:23:54+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  9:23AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Why have the definition at all?

It's my understanding that OD&amp;D (1974) didn't use it (even as late as the AD&amp;D player's handbook, the name is very seldom used. I don't think it's used more that a couple of times there, maybe less. It was much more used in other games like RQ at the time).</blockquote>First use of the term "role-playing" in a TSR D&amp;D product was I believe toward the back of either the Greyhawk or Blackmoor supplement to original D&amp;D, where it appears in a price list of TSR products.<br/><br/>Traveller (1977) uses the term "role-playing game simulation" in the blurb on the back of the box.<br/>AD&amp;D PHB (1978) uses the term "fantasy roleplaying games" in the introduction. I'm skeptical that RQ uses significantly more or less than AD&amp;D since the term really isn't necessary outside of blurbs and introductions. Maybe RQ III does, but RQ II (1978) has a more straightforward approach, largely assuming the audience knows what it's getting into or will infer it directly from the rules themselves.<br/><br/>Dave Weseley, who in the 1960's either invented or discovered the form of the modern RPG (depending on your perspective) when he did Braunstein, has an interview over at the Acaeum where he states he disliked the term "role-playing game" because role-playing already had connotations from improv theater and psychotherapy; he preferred "Adventure Game" but it didn't catch on in the sense he wanted. (The term did get used for a while to mean wargames + RPGs.)<br/><br/>Looking at the Tome of Treasures website I see from some product lists included in early D&amp;D sets that "swords and sorcery [war]gaming" was also experimented with along with the semi-famous "Fantastic Medieval Wargames". The 1977 6th printing of the white box has the aforementioned reference to "game of swords and sorcery role-playing" in the pricelist at the back of Men &amp; Magic (the first booklet), while the 5th printing (1975) just has "swords and sorcery wargaming" in the corresponding location. Eldritch Wizardry (1976) uses the older formulation. Same applies to the 1975-76 printings of Blackmoor, and up to the April, 1977 3rd printing.<br/><br/>So it seems that TSR began using the term no earlier than 1976 and no later than 1977, and it's probably the vagaries of printing timing that determined exactly which product it appeared in first--definitely not the first printing of any of the OD&amp;D + supplements.<br/><br/>Aside from that I think I've been told that the term appears in the Strategic Review, the predecessor to the Dragon, which was published 1975-76.<br/><br/>[EDIT: rereading the data, I think we can pretty definitely narrow the year down to 1977 for the first use of "role-playing" in the D&amp;D price lists at the back of the D&amp;D books. I.e., 6th printing White Box (1977) uses the term, but 3rd printing Blackmoor (1977) doesn't. Whether it appears inside the text of any of the books--probably not, but I'm not 100% certain.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140826/#Comment_140826" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T11:37:15+00:00" title="April 22, 2008 11:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Elliot. <br/>\n<br/>\nWeseley's ideas are interesting, including the fact that his term is still in use in it's abased form in one important place today.

This was done via text search, so could have missed a reference in an advertisement. A relevant point, the TSR price list from the back of that issue does not reference D&amp;D as a role playing game, so Tim Kask's editorial may indeed be the first reference to role playing game by TSR (which would make sense, I would actually expect an editorial or essay about gaming to be the first reference, not a price list).<br/><br/>If I get ambitious tonight, I'll check the issues of Wargamer's Digest that I have set aside as having D&amp;D relevancy (including the May? 1974 issue which has an article about D&amp;D by Gary Gygax) and see if there's an earlier reference. The issues I have set aside include the earliest ones in my collection with various advertisements.<br/><br/>Of course this would just establish the earliest published reference, clearly the earliest usage predates this publishing by at least the lead time for the publication.<br/><br/>Does anyone have an intact collection of early Wild Hunts and/or Alarums &amp; Excursions?

But even if we were to find out that the term was only used late in describing play, I'm not sure that it affects the discussion. I'll even stipulate that, in fact, the term was introduced because some people found similarities between these games, how they were playing them, and role-playing from psychology (or some other use of the term). Even that it may have occured from the propensity that people observe in play for people to use the first-person. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the fact is that, even if it comes about from that observation, at the same time the wargamey version of play continues to be present right through this evolution. And those people are playing D&amp;D as written. It is, in fact, people figuring out the new way to play that are tacking on these elements unbidden by the early books. We applaud them for making the leap, sure. But the point is that D&amp;D is as of some point being referred to as a RPG, and both sides are claiming to be playing D&amp;D. And the wargamey version is the older way to play it. And they have always, since the advent of the term, been claiming to be playing RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\nHmm. I was playing TFT in 77 or so...

D&amp;D clearly evolved out of wargame play. But even that wargamey play was definitely something different to me when I first started playing. I had been playing wargames for several years before I started playing D&amp;D. I myself didn't get into any first person play in those wargame years, though I had other sorts of play that were more first person play, just without any sort of rules. It also didn't take me long after starting to play D&amp;D to realize that D&amp;D play had something in common with both sorts of play (wargames and first person play [either cops &amp; robbers style, or play with army men and other such toys]).<br/><br/>I do see Mike's point of using inclusive definitions, though I have long been frustrated with the use of role playing game for computer games.

Where any definition will actually either include things that are not really at all RPGs, or will disinclude forms that are valuable to the discussion of what RPGs are. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140961/#Comment_140961" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T11:33:19+00:00" title="April 23, 2008 11:33AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, do you think that RPG can be a solo activity? The early computer RPGs were all single player, interacting with a machine. Perhaps I'm being inflexible.<br/><br/>When computer games first started calling themselves RPGs, it felt to me that they were just laying claim to the phenomenon that was role playing.<br/><br/>Is someone a Christian just because they've heard the label before and declare themselves Christian, or do they have to derive their religion somehow from other Christianity? Ok, so that logic doesn't totally exclude CRPGs since they derived rule structure from table top RPGs. An interesting thought experiment here, take a silent movie of a Christian church service (make sure also not to catch any text - make sure the movie shows imagery only). Show that to a group of people and encourage them to practice religion based on that imagery. Is that group practicing Christianity?<br/><br/>The problem for me is that the element that I saw that made D&amp;D <b>different</b> from anything I had played before is missing from (early) CRPGs, even though I wasn't able to articulate the difference completely at that time (though I saw the infinity of possibility and potentially unending play as part of the difference).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140962/#Comment_140962" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T11:53:39+00:00" title="April 23, 2008 11:53AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>However I disagree that the wargamey (colloquially, hack &amp; slash with what you might call pawn stance) approach is the older version of the game.

I seem to recall that Dave was supposedly infamous for not keeping written instructions ( certainly not typed ones anyway) on how the games were played. Instead, there might be appropriate charts and brief explanation of their use, but not necessarily greater instructions on how the game as a whole was played. <br/><br/>Correct, incorrect, partially correct ?<br/><br/>The reason I bring it up is because I'm aware of a few different sorts of minis wargames that are refereed and seem to border (or are) RPG style play.

Perhaps. Who can say when the mental leap took place. In fact I think it was less of a leap, but a slow metamorphosis in understanding. It actually took me about 5 years... five.. years... of play before I started to understand that RPGs could be something more than the avataristic wargames we'd been playing since 1977. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone remember the "Caller?" Intended to facilitate moving tactical play on, this role was intended to ensure that players didn't interrupt the flow of the game with anything non-critical - to say nothing of silly first person portrayal. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, again I stipulate that Gygax may have seen into the future the first time Dave ran the Chainmail scenario, and that play may have gone this way immediately. But for a great many groups, what they got from Dave's incomplete texts, was that it was a wargame, with avatars. And that's how the game was played. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey quite simply did not have any language to tell people to "act the part of the role of the character." You have to put yourself in their shoes and understand that nobody had ever played a game like this. Heck, it was bold to even think to add these elements of "let's pretend" to the play. So we'll have to forgive them if they put it out there and just hoped that people would get something cogent in play from it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd people did. But it varied. For the vast majority to start it was just a wargame, with avatars. Myself included. We called them RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140970/#Comment_140970" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T12:54:18+00:00" title="April 23, 2008 12:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2008 12:54PM by Moreno R..">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/gsvenson/FirstDungeonAdv.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.tampabay.rr.com/gsvenson/FirstDungeonAdv.html</a><br/>This first-hand account of the first-ever dungeon adventures GMd by Arneson doesn't seems very "wargame-ish", the use of darkness and screams, the kind of perils ("try to seduce him"?)...

It's not roleplay itself that's desired, it's that avalanche of cause and effect.

So a pc steals a loaf of bread, which has him chased, which has him hide in an alcove, which has someone else grabbed as if they were the theif, which has the first person find a secret passage to the thieves guild...and so on, the effect on the first person and second person effect other people in dramatic ways, which affect others in dramatic ways, and so on.

As you can see from Moreno's cite, there are first-person recollections after all.<br/><br/>About the banana republic game, it was created by Dave Weseley, though I believe he handed off GMing (and maybe his notes) to Dave Arneson when Weseley was called away by other responsibilities. From what I've read, Arneson's method was to keep a black binder full of notes, but I believe in the recent Wired article on Gygax you'll find a claim that Arneson's notes weren't very clear.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, the game was played by Arneson's group and Gygax's group before publication, thus was disseminated by more-than-textual means at first, and concurrently with purely textual means later, as people learned the game through a sort of chain of apprenticeship and/or sought out Gygax and Arneson with correspondence and telephone calls. And of course this applies even more to the Braunstein and banana republic games, not to mention the activities of other miniatures wargames clubs and interest groups, who conducted "campaigns" that, unlike Monopoly or Diplomacy, contained large amounts of "freeform" adjudication and player self-orientation/motivation. (In English: the rules left a lot up to collective judgment under the leadership of a referee, and it seems players didn't have formally-defined objectives or victory conditions.) The gaps in the formal rules didn't create problems because there were shared understandings that were transmitted socially and through practice. Everyone understood what they were all doing, even though they may not have had a word for it. Within a few years it had been labeled "role playing", but since the term suggests multiple meanings, it didn't do anything to clarify the purpose of the texts which were themselves practically skeletal.<br/><br/>Before I go to bed: Mike, your criteria for "role playing game" in posts 167 and 169 (and earlier I guess) are interesting in the perspective they show: to me, saying that D&amp;D was "only" avatarism is missing the point. What I hope to show a bit more of in terms of evidence is that to the early proto-roleplaying culture, "avatarism" combined with self-orientation was "the thing" that they were doing. I contend that it was only after the texts were taken up outside the this culture that people began interpreting "roleplaying" in other ways. Yet "avatarism" combined with self-orientation can't be seen as a "primitive" or primordial approach--it's still one of the main streams of the hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141019/#Comment_141019" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T00:03:02+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:03AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2008 12:03AM by Arminius.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About avatarism, I see that Mike is looking for an essay about the Myth of the Red Queen.

What's important is that it lacks that quality that Josh is talking about that means that he would define that play as not RPG play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd say that this sort of D&amp;D play has lots of qualities shared by other RPGs, the sorts of qualities that I'm interested in looking at. "Exploration" is one of them, and what I think you're sorta getting at with "sim leads to more sim." There are probably many others. D&amp;D play that is entirely pawn play can still be considered at least "mostly an RPG" because it contains so many of these elements. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just doesn't contain the one. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not at all saying that avatarism is definitive, as Universalis doesn't have it. It's got the SIS stuff, exploration, and other elements of RPGs enough that the only reason I often say it's not an RPG is simply to make sure that people aren't surprised when they find out that there's no avatarism. But it's certainly in the umbrella. Because, just like D&amp;D with no SIS, it's got a preponderance of elements to it's play that make it similar. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's the point. Saying that any one element is "that which without which it is not RPG" ignores that what you're talking about is similar in so many other ways. Monopoly I disinclude because even if you find one or two similarities, mostly you'll find dissimilarities. The functional definition of RPG is "Those activities that include substantial numbers of elements that you find in other RPG forms." Or something like that. So we can discuss Monopoly in that context, if we want to discuss it at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, as I've said, forget the definition entirely, and simply discuss the ways in which any particular activity is like other RPGs, or dislike it. Any other use of a definition seems to me to be political. And, yeah, if it's just political, then I find people's outrage against any such use to be quite justified. That's not the same as me saying that I think self-identification is bad... it's fine that we talk about "Story-games" here, to make folks understand that as a community we're only interested in a small, locally-defined subset of RPG play. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'm sure by now I'm sounding like a broken record. Apologies for that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141109/#Comment_141109" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T10:54:22+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 10:54AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using the wayback machine, we retrieve the essay: http://web.archive.org/web/20070526004054/http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org.uk/AvatarismAndTheMythOfTheRedQueen<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's an interesting read.

What's important is that it lacks that quality that Josh is talking about that means that he would define that play as not RPG play.</blockquote>That's fine but just to be clear, as far as I'm concerned avatarism \u2260 pawn play. Avatarism IMO doesn't entirely encompass some things that have become more common in RPGs over the years, such as regarding one's PC as a distinct personality, with consciously constructed behaviors and motivations, a fleshed-out personal history. It also doesn't cover certain expectations with regard to story and plot. But it's distinct from pawn play or "mere wargames" because the player regards the events of the game as if he's experiencing them himself, from the perspective of the character. There is an imaginary world being explored and engaged, basically what around here goes by the term SIS.\n<blockquote>I'd say that this sort of D&amp;D play has lots of qualities shared by other RPGs, the sorts of qualities that I'm interested in looking at. "Exploration" is one of them, and what I think you're sorta getting at with "sim leads to more sim." There are probably many others. D&amp;D play that is entirely pawn play can still be considered at least "mostly an RPG" because it contains so many of these elements.</blockquote>Note, I didn't talk about "sim leads to more sim". It rings a bell, maybe someone else in this thread wrote it, but it's nothing I've said.\n<blockquote>Saying that any one element is "that which without which it is not RPG" ignores that what you're talking about is similar in so many other ways. Monopoly I disinclude because even if you find one or two similarities, mostly you'll find dissimilarities. The functional definition of RPG is "Those activities that include substantial numbers of elements that you find in other RPG forms." Or something like that. So we can discuss Monopoly in that context, if we want to discuss it at all.</blockquote>\nWhat's missing here I'm afraid is that inclusion is no less arbitrary and political than exclusion. Real inclusiveness would have space for the perspective that some games aren't RPGs rather than insisting on accepting a "big tent" definition. Part of the reason why I feel justified in saying this is that RPGs (or shall we the say the hobby) found their identity not only by what they were but also by what they were not. The same is true of wargames--what a revelation it was to find <i>War at Sea</i> and see how different it was from <i>Battleship</i>--not to mention Euros. These days people talk about Euros vs. Ameritrash board games, but unlike the various RPG/Storygame discussions, there's not much debate about what does or doesn't fall into each category, even among people who prefer the seemingly disparaged Ameritrash games. But getting back to RPGs, back in the 70's people knew they had something new because it was different from what was old; not only was the "gods-eye view" that was still in many wargames discarded entirely, but the third-person view of film and literature was also replaced. Developments that reintroduced those qualities--or even the boardgamish qualities from which wargames had distinguished themselves--were "retrograde" in a sense because they went against the way that the form was understood and appreciated.<br/><br/>We might be better off today if "role playing" had never caught on, in favor of a term (such as Adventure game) that was less descriptive and more arbitrary--thus less subject to interpretation and political wrangling. "Euro" for example is obviously arbitrary, and the root meaning hasn't really impeded the recognition that an American-made game can be a Euro.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141274/#Comment_141274" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T09:22:32+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  9:22AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Well, it's good we haven't said that then.</blockquote>\nPerhaps I was confused by what you said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Well, that's the trick, see.

It's not about whether Monopoly is included in the RPG club or Excluded. It's about looking at Monopoly and saying " It's like an RPG because/when..." and "It isn't like an RPG because/when..."<br/><br/>So what's the big deal? It's more long-winded, but more accurate, in a nutshell.

Is it a game where it's not only important to play-act, but to really try to think from the POV of your charactre as an existent being with a limited amount of info?<br/><br/>Okay, now that's useful. That tells me something more than "It's a roleplaying game"<br/><br/>And all of that applies pretty broadly. Instead of "It's a roleplaying game..." we can start with "It's a game where..." or "the physical stuff associated with this game is..." or, really any number of more descriptive explanations.<br/><br/>And, as far as it goes, it's also pretty useful from a design standpoint. If you're designing a game where that bit I mentioned is the core "thing", that implies you'll try to do include methods that support that "thing" or at least don't interefere with the "thing" ( a much, much greater sin in my book tjhan failure to support the "thing").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141302/#Comment_141302" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T12:03:31+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 12:03PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob gets it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Frank, read my words.

Monopoly does have many qualities in common with at least one RPG (even the random movement per turn I'm pretty sure has been used in at least one RPG). Also, are all qualities equal in importance?<br/><br/>I'm on board with your idea, I'm just fishing for how do we know we have enough RPG-like qualities.<br/><br/>I see one major point to build agreement about though (even if someone isn't prepared to buy into the whole of your idea) is to not exclude a game just because you can name a single RPG element the particular game doesn't have (for example, not excluding Universalis simply because characters aren't owned by players). It's also useful to say A in an RPG because it has features X, Y, and Z.<br/><br/>Or is what you are getting at that we should never simply say "X is an RPG." I think it is useful to be able to say such, but it's also useful to be able to articulate what RPG-like qualities X has. The level of detail in explaining what a game is or is not is also dependent on the context of the conversation you are having. When I talk to my mom, I usually just say I played D&amp;D last weekend, even if what I actually played was Universalis, because the difference between D&amp;D and Universalis is irrelevant to my mom, and she parses "D&amp;D" quicker than "RPG." But obviously, if I'm posting in a "players wanted" list about my upcoming game, I'd better not say "D&amp;D" if I'm actually running Universalis. Even if I am playing some version of D&amp;D, I'd better specify which, and at least some idea of what house rules I'm using, etc. etc. I usually include in such postings that people should engage me in discussion about what the game will be like because it's impossible for me to communicate everything that may be relevant to a given person's decision to play or not.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141323/#Comment_141323" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T13:33:57+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  1:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>It simply doesn't have enough similarities to any other RPG.</blockquote>\nMike, aren't you still excluding Monopoly by saying what it isn't though?<br/>Nobody ever brings "politics" into the really obvious cases.

Or is he just tired of summarizing genre theory? 'Cos that's what you're stumbling toward.<br/><br/>Also, I just posted in my livejournal a round up of criteria that people commonly apply to RPGs. I found four:<br/><br/>1. The aesthetic or thematic criterion. In essence, "It's about telling a story and/or simulating 'a real world'." (Maybe this is two criteria.)<br/>2. The freeform procedure criterion. In essence, "A lot of the stuff that happens in the game isn't defined by formal rules."<br/>3. The motivational criterion. In essence, "There are no winners or losers."<br/>4. The endgame criterion. In essence, "The game keeps going on as long as the players feel like it."<br/><br/>To these you can add "first person play" aka avatarism. Or you can make it another subhead of (1).<br/><br/>This is all very interesting if I say so myself, from the perspective of cultural analsysis. But it doesn't really answer why we should be inclusive or exclusive. Is the reason for preferring inclusiveness over exclusiveness that it just keeps people from yelling at each other? Or is there some other benefit?<br/><br/>Komradebob does got it, except I'd add: the line between RPGs and wargames is just as arbitrary and invites exactly the same sort of deconstruction. Back in the 70's, "adventure gaming" was purposed to mean pretty much "all those unusual games that broke the traditional board/card game mold". It included wargames, sports games, RPGs, and funky games like Acquire, Cosmic Encounter, or Quirks. For me at least there was also an overlap with things like Conway's game of Life. These were all innovative forms of play, largely linked by an audience of geeks and grinds--with a strong indoorsiness I might add. The divergence was as much a product of the audience as it was of structural qualities. RPGs attracted an influx of non-grinds and \xfcbergeeks, consequently became less grind-y, and the cultures split apart and diverged. Years later a similar process occurred with Euros, so that looking back we might now see some of those 70's games such as Acquire and realize they'd be considered Euros if they were published today. (My experience is that the audience for Euros is weighted toward people with Engineering Personalities.)<br/><br/>But back then it was all the same stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141328/#Comment_141328" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T14:26:21+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  2:26PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Komradebob does got it, except I'd add: the line between RPGs and wargames is just as arbitrary and invites exactly the same sort of deconstruction.</blockquote>\nWell yes, but then I'm still trying to breakdown the barricade between storygames and wargames, so...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141475/#Comment_141475" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T08:51:13+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  8:51AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Enough" is, again, not really relevant. It's "enough" if somebody thinks it's enough to call it a RPG. Without doing so absurdly. <br/>\n<br/>\nPut it this way, do you see anyone calling Monopoly an RPG? Is there any game that you see people calling an RPG that doesn't have significant elements of other RPGs in them? <br/>\n<br/>\nMore importantly, the point is not to exclude Monopoly - that's already done. It's to look at the qualities that make up RPGs so that we can discuss them. <br/>\n<br/>\nElliot has a good list started:<br/>\nRelated to item #1, however, is the all-important (so important some want to make it definitional) assumption about SIS. Does the game have a SIS. Even games created as stories, I'd argue, might not have a SIS (especially if they're told by only one player, dare I say "Storyteller"). Narrative is not SIS. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother feature is resolution systems. Freeform doesn't have these, and so some would disinclude them as RPGs. But they tend to be endemic to most forms. <br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter enumeration is another. That is having numeric representations of character abilities. Again, freeform doesn't have these. Much LARP doesn't have these either, though they may still have resolution systems, interestingly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably a whole lot of these. And they're fuzzy in some ways, too... you might have a system that seems like resolution a bit, but like a development system in other ways. So I doubt that we'll get a definitive list. But I think we can identify the major elements. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe ought to have terms for these, but I fear that charges of elitism will arise if we try to jaronize too much...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141477/#Comment_141477" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T09:18:27+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  9:18AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Freeform tends to lack a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consistent</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">formal</span> system to deal with <b>players</b> strongly disagreeing on outcomes of an interaction among imagined elements.<br/><br/>RPGs tend to have a formal system (or several), but it may or may not be consistently used. They may also obscure the idea that they resolve a dispute in "vision" or probability between two actual players, concentrating instead on the fictional elements.*<br/><br/>Human judgement seems to also be a factor in determinig the likelihood of outcomes in an RPG, to such an extent that it might be an identifying factor of RPGs. With CRPGs ( and some things like text based adventurs or CYOA Books/solo modules) that seems to have an additional step of removal between the person deciding likelihood of outcomes.<br/><br/>* I've noticed that non-gamers immediately notice this aspect of RPGs, moreso than gamers who seem to accept the idea that the disagreement is somehow only related to the fictional elements.

I am open to constructive criticism, suggestions, and comments in general.  Forgive my arrogance.<br/>\n<br/>\nResisting a definition of an RPG only posits it as a non-reality.  Everything that exists has a definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would alter Eliot's list a bit by taking a different perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is an RPG?  When we define something we have to look at the most pure and simple form of the thing and identify its parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that the absolute bare minimum components that are required for something to be considered an RPG are five in number.  The first is group.  If you are sitting by yourself, it doesn't seem to be role-playing, but rather authorship or daydreaming.  Your writing or thinking by yourself.  RPG video-games still include \u201cthe other\u201d in the sense that the game writers and designers are not the player and something outside of himself is involved in the game.  It is not a solo activity.  The second component would be progression.  Quod Scripsi, Scripsi, what is written is written.  If you can go back and rewrite or represent a previous account, it becomes a sort of collaborative story-telling/ writing.  You can't move backwards.  It has to be in a sense \u201clive.\u201d  Even play-by-post RPGs follow this rule.  Game mechanics that allow a player to \u201cre-do\u201d something can be considered cohesive in a sense that the previous action never really entered into \u201cshared imagined space.\u201d (Forgive me if I am misusing this term!) Freedom is the third component.  If we aren't free to choose our actions in game, we are either actors on a stage with a script or simply watching a movie.  Both can be rewarding, but neither seem to be role-playing.  The fourth component is story.  Without a story, we are simply playing chess or another board game.  I will reference this as Ron did: \u201ca series of caused events.\u201d  The last component is system.  Without system, we are merely competing egos in a stream of consciousness.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.Group<br/>\n2.Progression<br/>\n3.Freedom<br/>\n4.Story<br/>\n5.System<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the five components that, if one is missing, role-playing ceases.  I have explanations of the terms written out if anybody wants them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/outsider" title="outsider"><img alt="outsider" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/outsider">outsider</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238457/#Comment_238457" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T16:31:37+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  4:31PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops, didn't realize this had been dead so long....<br/>\nOops, double-post.....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6209/what-is-roleplaying-and-how-do-i-find-it/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6209/what-is-roleplaying-and-how-do-i-find-it">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6209/what-is-roleplaying-and-how-do-i-find-it/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6209/what-is-roleplaying-and-how-do-i-find-it/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6209/what-is-roleplaying-and-how-do-i-find-it/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6209%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6209%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
