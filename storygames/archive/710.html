                    So, what phrases have meaning to your group that the rest of us will probably boggle at?  What do they mean?<br/><br/>We, as you know, have HARDCORE!!!.  Because everyone should have a reason to be HARDCORE!!! <br/><br/>There's also DOOM!! (pronounced with exclamation points or without), which basically means that some kind of exciting confrontation is coming, or that someone has done something which will make a confrontation inevitable at some point.  For example, getting back together with your sometimes-homicidal ex-girlfriend?  DOOM!!!, because it means that you and she are definitely going to have a confrontation sooner or later, and the stakes of the conflict will be high.  It's often used to warn someone that what they're doing is going to create mega-conflict later, and often used to excitedly inform the rest of the group that DOOM!! is coming.<br/><br/>Beatdown means something is really, really cool when used as a noun, or to administer a smackdown when used as a verb.  For example, having a fist-fight in freefall is beatdown.  Winning the fistfight before hitting the ground is beating down the enemy.  Realizing that your enemy disabled your parachute during the fight is being beaten down.<br/><br/>I'm sure we have more vocabulary we've invented, but I can't think of it right now - and in any case, I'm curious to hear how you guys talk to each other about things that are hard to describe in other ways!<br/><br/>--Jess                </div>

                            We have HARDCORE too... but in a LARP context and for us it means something more like going above and beyond the norm in the service of full immersion in to the game world.  Like lying "dead" in a ditch for 3 hours so that people can find your body.<br/><br/>to "ming" is to be filled with kewl powerz  <br/><br/>"mingy" as a result means uber powerful and cheesy like "my half-demon, half-drow, half-dragon is invulnerable to magic, and has a sword that can kill God. also he has invisible weightless magical full plate armour which is magically silenced so it doesn't affect his move silently skill"<br/><br/>"wommmmm": sound effect (sounds like the shield Sonic the Hedgehog had in the original game).  Means to hit someone with a mind control type effect.  like "I use my charm effect on him... <i>wommmmm....</i>"<br/><br/>Running joke at the beginning of each session:<br/>A player will say one of the following, followed the response from the GM.<br/><br/>"I kill George Marker..."  <i>(long running bad guy in another game, long since dead)</i><br/><br/>"OK, he's dead... what now?"<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>"I carry on going..."<br/><br/>"OK, nothing happens..."<br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

<p>We don't have <em>vocabulary</em> per se, but there's an obligatory exaggerated shifty-eye gesture (the kind that's emoticoned this way:<br/>
&lt;.&lt;<br/>
&gt;.&gt;<br/>
) that you do when you roll terribly on a saving throw that'll kill your guy or equally terribly while trying to be awesome and failing, ad consequently you <em>surreptitiously nudge</em> the die to a new result. I think there's a cap on how many times you can do this in a day, but we're not so unlucky that anyone's felt the need to use it to excess.</p>

                            After reading a thread just like this years ago, I think at RPG.net. My group adopted this one: Requesting that another player meet you in "Palladium section" is requesting to have a private conversation away from the group.<br><br>"Pouching the baby" is when someone comes up with a plan that's so crazy it breaks the brain just to listen to it. The plan could work, it's just mindboggling to deal with. This one's my fault. It came from an Exalted game where one character experienced a rape/seduction by an Abyssal which led the Abyssal to be pregnant. My character a Lunar, not happy about that had an opportunity to kill the mother, but knew that even despite the circumstances of the conception, the father would want the child to live, even though we'd be happy iif she died. So my devised a plan by which she could kill the mother, take the baby and, with the help of a sorcerer she knew, raise it to birthing age in the pouch of her marsupial form.<br/><br/>"World is my ship" - To declare that you're going to go a little "world is my ship" means that you want  to attempt to do something majorly cool but that stretches the definition of a trait, power or ability on your sheet. It's usually used to seek permission from or to warn the GM that you know that the action may not be doable. It comes from another Exalted game where a Eclipse air ship captain used one of her sail charms in an ingenious way to affect the world around her, and not just her ship.<br/><br/>"Going to the crow's nest" is anything that absolutely disallowed by unreasonable GM fiat.<br/><br/>"Double bagging" is a character, under some manner of protection in the story, using their action to provide a secondary layer of protection to only themselves. It's usually use derisively, as is "Biter" for when anybody is infringes or overlaps the core schtick of another character.<br/><br/>"Can't sleep. Gotta go to Iraq": Is used to describe any game that is jam-packed with crazy, immediate action (note: this well predates 9/11 or the current incursion in Iraq).<br/><br/>In the T&amp;J game, Brand and I have a couple of new ones:<br/><br/>"Is that inked yet?" Because T+J is structured and described (often panel by panel) as a graphic novel, this has started to be used to ask whether the thing just declared is set in stone or if it is negotiable. If it isn't inked, it can be erased, and redrawn.<br/><br/>"Greenscreened" In the graphic novel, precognitive visions are annotated like a green-tinged video screen, and precog action, by action lines in the same colour.  To handle the precog ability, when Brand puts something into the fiction that I want a chance to pre-empt using my power I accept his description, but declare it greenscreened -  the action has not yet occured, but will, unless I can stop it.<br/><br/>There's lots more, but I can't think of them.                        </br></br></div>

<b>Skull Pigs</b> If you play your character in a generally anti-social way (refusing to have him engage with the story, having him constantly split off from the party to go brood, picking fights with other characters for no reason) he runs the risk of being eaten by Skull Pigs.  <br/><br/>This came from a Werewolf game where we were all fledgling werewolves.  One of the characters evinced all of the above behaviors and ran off into the woods on his own - he was promptly attacked and killed by skull-headed pigs who had being lying in wait for our pack.<br/><br/>In general, if a player is not wanting to engage in the game we are playing and being dickley he will be greeted by a chorus of piggy snorting and rooting as a warning.  Only the one character has ever actually been killed by them so far, but the Skull Pigs are always waiting...watching.<br/><br/><br/><b>Game Crushing</b> - Making out of character jokes, breaking the mood, engaging in non-game crosstalk, and generally busting the groove of people who are trying to play.  As in "quit crushing the game, dude".  Sometimes accompanied by miming crushing something into the table and making crunching noises.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Olive Press</b> - The maximum level of Game Crushing - usually a joke that makes the whole table burst into laughter and ruins a really dramatic scene or generally derails the entire game.  Usually indicated by making horizontal cranking motions accompanied by a sqeaking sound- as if you were crushing the game in a hand cranked Olive Press.<br/><br/><br/><b>Drippy Sewer Pipe</b> - Filthy and dank living conditions.  From a Vampire game where a fugitive vampire had to sleep in the sewer on a filthy mattress and take showers under said sewer pipe.<br/><br/><br/><b>Bromp!</b> - The sound of failure.  Usually voiced when you critically fail.  Comes from a console game sound effect.<br/><br/><br/>And many more too esoteric and arcane to list...                        </div>

                            When we played FUDGE you'd get a point for doing something that went horribly wrong, or collaborating with the GM to get your character into utterly miserable situations, like contracting river blindness in Africa.

                            "Unicorn Trouble"  is our term (pulled from a previous gaming group, of which 2/3 are involved with our (somewhat larger) extended gaming cluster, but which didn't involve me) for when the person running a plot uses an element that, due to relative ignorance, breaks the suspension of disbelief of at least one of the other players (called so from an Ars Magica game where the person GMing at the time introduced a unicorn, established it as "horse-like", and then proceeded to have it act in ways that were, as was obvious to the other two players, who actually knew how to ride a horse, antithetical to the way a horse actually acts).  More loosely, the problem you get when the person GMing something clearly doesn't know as much about it as her players.                        </div>

<b>Rockstar</b> -- it's a noun, it's a verb, it's occasionally an adjective.  It's applicable whenever your character (or the player, for that matter) significantly changes their situation and world, especially in a flashy or destructive manner.  You are a rockstar if you trash the guest chambers the prince gave you while you stayed in the city. You totally rockstarred the summit meeting if you gained as many new allies as new enemies.  And then there are the accompanying terms like "Rock Out" or "Rock Their World" to indicate that you are about to engage in actions that may qualify for Rockstar status.<br/><br/>When we played World of Warcraft, our guild was the Rockstars of Azeroth; my character was the High Priest of Rock.  Camp heaven.                        </div>

<p>Joshua BishopRoby: The word <em>rockstar</em> is plain genius.</p>
<p>Here in Denmark, the word "rocker" means "member of a biker gang", and a contingent of Danish roleplayers (mostly in Aalborg, Jutland) say stuff like "That was <em>rocker fedt</em>", which means "That was <em>Biker-Fat</em>." It carries like connotations, but with less concentration on the throw-the-TV-in-the-swimming-pool.</p>

I once ran Terrible Trouble at Tragidore, the old module that came with the AD&amp;D2 screen. In it, a lumberjack village on the outskirts of some woods suddenly found itself loosing their men, who all disappeared in the forest within a very short span of time.<br/>
<br/>
So, the as the party goes forth and explores said woods, they come across a small fortress, without any patrols or watchmen or whatnot.<br/>
<br/>
Their plan for getting in: make themselves invisible and create an illusion of lumberjacks knocking on the door. Only, they decided not to make one of the guys invisible and he just stood there, to the side of the door, trying to hide.<br/>
<br/>
You have to note that this was back in the days when I was playing traditional dysfunctional AD&amp;D and GM Fiat was the order of the day. So, I carefully analysed the situation from the point of view of the baddies and decided that, yeah, they saw through it, dispelled the illusions and invisibility, and proceeded to embark on a Total Party Kill.<br/>
<br/>
In retrospect, we analysed the party's plan and everyone seems to agree that it wasn't the sanest thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
To this day, whenever someone proposes a plan that doesn't sound so good, someone offers as an alternative, "we dress up as lumberjacks". When someone does something that turns out to be incredibly dense, it's also not unusual to be called a lumberjack.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Time for poker night</b>, for when the characters have all been doing their own things for a while, and the players have a sense that it's time to get together and compare notes.  Taken from a modern horror game when the characters got together for poker on a regular basis.<br/><br/><b>King of the card</b>.  We like to play games where everyone has a hand in building the world, and we use index cards for this process.  This term refers to the person who selected a specific aspect of the world, and there are times when we go back to this person during the game to provide more information.<br/><br/><b>Feed him to the shoggoths</b>.  Probably a very common phrase for <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> player groups.  Came about for us during a scene of <i>Beyond the Mountains of Madness</i> where, fleeing some hideous place, one of the players actually had his guy throw another PC into the maw of a pursuing monster.  (The strategy worked, and everyone else got away alive, except... the PC who did the deed would go on to shoot himself in the face a wee bit later.)<br/><br/><b>Standard Opterating Procedure</b> refers in horror games to a type of HARDCORE!!! investigation, implying intense effort and rigor.  What it really is, is a cue to the GM that the players aren't interested in lavish planning, and simply want to get to something else that's more interesting.<br/><br/><b>Irish Spring</b>, used in a lame Irish accent.  Cue for "your accent is silly".  Time was that one of our GMs used little phrases like this to get into his Irish policeman accent.<br/><br/><b>The Kill List</b>.  In a game full of characters which are all pursuing their own fucked up, probably evil purposes, I used to publish a list of characters who deserve to be killed, in order of decreasing evil.  We had a particularly nasty NPC, Tsai Chou, who was on the list at all times, and was a kind of bar.  "Holy crap, I'm above Tsai on the Kill List?" someone would say, and I'd go," Yeah, dude.  Remember how you sacrificed those babies last time?"  And the guy would say, "But I saved the city!" and I would say, "At 20 SAN, I'm sure you think you did."<br/><br/>-Jason                        </div>

<i>The Kill List.

I never got on well with the whole concept of vampires that were romantic, or sexy, or whatever else. They were kind of brutal, inhumane, vicious, ugly, or angry. A number of my characters went really HARDCORE. I stopped liking the LARP scene once it stopped feeling like the local theatre geeks and I getting together to make some mad stories and more like... well what the Camarilla is today, so I quit.<br/><br/>I found out several years after that there was a regional "Red List" that is essentially what you're describing, and that, unbenownst to me, not one but two of my characters had made it. It *almost* made me want to go back and play, but then I remembered it was VLARP and came to my senses.                        </div>

My character would intentionally pick fights with the minotaurs (who were like a race in our games... basically they would sit in inns and drink just like dwarves or humans would.)<br/>

                            Since the thread was mentioned on Best Of with the suggestion that it should continue, here are some of mine:<br/>
<br/>
"Stronger than Layne... Faster than Layne?!?"<br/>
This came from a lengthy campaign of Vampire: the Masquerade where all the players juggled characters except one.  The one player who stuck to her guns played a (True) Brujah brawler named Layne.  She eventually became one of the best bricks I've seen in a game that began as a personal horror game and grew/devolved into gothic superheroes.  Layne had her own quote whilst they were facing a small horde of Sabbat, "OK... I can take the five on right, you guys will have to deal with the other three".  <br/>
As I found myself upping the ante to throw challenges at PCs with gobs of XP, one particular NPC was a bit studly for the party brick.  As the baddie won initiative and put a whallop on her, one player in the group who often spoke excitedly called out, "Stronger than Layne?!? Faster than Layne?!?"<br/>
This became the key phrase for anything ridiculously powerful in the game (player or non-player).<br/>
<br/>
"That's a X point shiv"<br/>
During a two year Legend of the Five Rings game rife with bad puns, this became the witty rejoinder.  If someone expressed a painfully bad pun or dumb joke, someone else (it was a random reaction) would frown, roll a few dice (10 siders, it was L5R) and reply flatly, "That's a X point shiv," (X being the result of the roll of course).  This was mock damage to the player that had no effect other than to say, "Hey dude, that was a bad pun."  I don't know if it discouraged puns or rewarded them, but it was fun to throw mock damage at a player.<br/>
<br/>
"I hope you have his stats"<br/>
This was a phrase used by one of the Qualls boys, a group of three brothers who I met in college who had gamed together during their entire adolescent life.  The youngest uttered this challenge whenever an NPC slightly angered him: "I hope you have his stats" (which meant he was about to throw dice to settle the score).  It was as if NPCs didn't exist until they were on paper and then once they had permanence, he could beat them.  It was one of the weirdest threats I've seen in a game and the Qualls boys took his threat seriously.<br/>
<br/>
"I run as fast as I can, checking for traps!"<br/>
This phrase was born from the lips of a player called The Plez.  He was playing a thief and decided that he needed to make it safely across the dungeon but didn't want to waste all that time, so he logicked that he could run and check for traps at the same time.  This became the code phrase for multi-tasking for many games after.                        </div>

                            From my previous group:<br/>
<br/>
If someone did something silly or exceedingly strange in-character, we'd all look pointedly at him/her, then look away quickly, and cough out the word "shun" with our hands covering our mouths.<br/>
<br/>
We had this whole thing going where if someone gets embarrassed in-character, they'd start holding as still as they can, preferably with their arms out in a wacky position, and no one could "see" them until they start moving again.  Yeah, I don't understand it either, and I'm not sure how it started.<br/>
<br/>
If we disagreed with something, or thought it was a bad idea, we'd say "boop-boop," sort of like a "failure to execute" noise.  Example: "You want to order pizza?" "Boop-boop."  One of the members of our group used to do this all the time - I have no idea why - and it just caught on.<br/>
<br/>
"Rocks fall, you die," was also a popular joke.                        </div>

Since them it has come to mean any kind of MacGuffin.<br><b><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Rort&amp;defid=1410513" rel="nofollow">Rort</a></b>, means some kind of rules loophole that can be exploited by the players to enhance their character. A prime example is the GURPS 4e spell Grow which has no limits on size so a mage can quite easily end up 400' tall. One of our players has a sixth sense for these things - very useful for playtesting.                        </br></div>

                            "Perceiving mightily all the while" is a common phrase from my original group of players, said after stating whatever actions they plan to take, to indicate that spot/listen checks should be presumed and rolled as appropriate. We were playing Talislanta and the group included a Gryph, which in first edition had a PER of +4 -- typical ability scores ranged from -3 to +3, so that was on the exceptional side, and I think that had something to do with the origin of the phrase. The Gryph also had a (flying) speed of +8, which had something to do with "...at the speed of light" often being appended to the first phrase.                        </div>

                            Some choice phrases I've carried from group to group over the years:<br><br>"The Wall of Hardness." - Invoked when someone does something incredibly heroic, hardcore, tough, or simply demonstrates just how much of a badass their character is, as in, "Man, they'll have to chisel your name on the Wall of Hardness for that!"<br><br>"How's that pipe taste?" "Pretty damned bitter." - A nice call and response, gleaned off an old Dennis Miller routine. Used when the dice completely foul you up.

                            Back from my days in college:<br><br><b>PC Glow</b>:  that <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that allows PCs to instantly recognize another character as a fellow PC (e.g. "there are five other people in this tavern, but I think I will talk to this angry looking dwarf sitting by himself"), and grants them partial plot immunity (in the form of Fate/Drama/Chutzpah points or GM Fiat).  When an NPC does something particularly spectacular, he is said to acquire the "PC Glow".<br/><br/><b>Pulling a Grote</b>:  when a player's character is killed because the player declared an action that common sense dictates will result in death or catastrophe; e.g. doing something contrary with a gun pointed to your head, trying to walk on lava, etc.  Named after a friend who did this on several occasions.  In most such cases, he expected either the game mechanics or PC Glow to save him from the GM's wrath.<br/><br/><b>Pulling a Dean</b>:  like pulling a Grote, except that <i>someone else's</i> character is killed.  Likewise, named after the guilty party.  My favorite Fading Suns character was on the receiving end of the event that inspired this one.  (Poor Reggie Hawkwood, at least his terrible aunts can no longer marry him off.)                        </br></br></div>

                            Once upon a time, there was a GURPS worldjumpers game in which a dear friend of mine was playing a Russian scientist.<br/><br/>They were in an alternate world and suspected enemy worldjumpers of having control of a business and using it as a front to cover for their nefarious plans.<br/><br/>Russian scientist suggests: "Why don't we throw a brick through their front window and see what happens?"<br/><br/>JDCorley (GM) thinks "Well, that's a little crude, but not unreasonable, if they come running with time-period appropriate guns or someone calls the police, that's one piece of information, if they show up with laser beams and cover it up, that's another..."<br/><br/>All the other players revolted, "NO, we are NOT throwing a brick through the window."<br/><br/>They begin to come up with other plans. Infiltration, breaking and entering quietly, records searching, etc. <br/><br/>Each time a flaw (any flaw) is pointed out in these plans, the scientist pipes up with "Okay, how about the brick?"<br/><br/>This has lead (unjustly in my view, but alas! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> to the phrase:<br/><br/><b>The Brick</b> - a plan by a player that makes no fucking sense at all.<br/><br/>We have even handed out 'brick awards'. If you come up with a brick, we write your name and a phrase from the plan on the brick, and it is installed in our garden.                        </div>

Ah... my group does use this one! Except we say "Grok", or sometimes Thor, after a couple of big dumb - but oh so colourful - barbarians that have graced our table many a time.<br/><br/>We also have something akin to <b>PC Glow</b> that we call the <b>"PC Halo"</b> - although our version of the monkier is used more commonly to denote the special 'blessed status" of a PC. Such as "ok, so the airship crashes - everybody's dead, except you." "PC Halo does it again!" And yes, the best of NPCs could aquire the Halo. <br/><br/>One thing that my group does that hasn't been mentioned yet is <b>Rock-Paper-Scissors</b> - when something comes up, in-game or out, that noone wants to do, we RPS for it. "So, you come to a large ornate door, inscribed with swords &amp; flowers - who's going to go first?" And out come the fists...                        </div>

                            "we leave tonight!" said as fast as possible and with a sloppy french accent. Rooted in a 7th sea game. Meant to cut short an intersitial scene where the players are endlessly plotting/schemeing/shopping and not getting to the action. Its a call to cut ahead in the timeline to when we can get something more interesting done.                        </div>

<b>Gnarffle the Garthok - </b>This is from the Coneheads (either the movie or the skits, can't remember).  It's generally used when someone just got completely hosed (He really Gnarffled the Garthok!) or is about to do something to get completely hosed (Looks like he's about to Gnarffle the Garthok.).<br/><br/><b>Their only orcs! - </b>This came from an actual play experience where the group was playing a fairly high-level party and while scouting ran into some orcs.  The Paladin proceeded to proclaim, "They're only orcs.  We can take them!"  The party got it's ass handed to it.  Since then, anytime a player(s) looks like they're getting cocky or underestimating some opponent someone invariably calls out, "They're only orcs!"<br/><br/><b>Your head explodes. - </b>  This generally means that a certain character is unacceptable.  ie... "I've got this half-demon, half-dragon monk ninja assassin.  Is that cool?"  Hmmmm....  "Sure.  You're walking along and your head explodes.  Roll up another character."                        </div>

<b>Fiendish Dire Weasel!</b> (said while making the Hadouken motion from Street Fighter): this came out of the horrendous efficiency at low levels of draining people to death with a summoned dire weasel's Con-destroying bloodsucking.  Many a goblin and orc went down clutching at the horrendous ball of fur voraciously vacuuming its vital humors from its neck.  It got so common that someone commented that we were tossing fiendish dire weasels around like the Hadouken, and thus the phrase was born.  The mental image it provokes is pretty amusing.                        </div>

Interestingly, the only time (other than Exalted where the "PC Label" it is built in) where i had a character that needed to "join a party in progress", said party busted into my character's workplace &amp; got him fired in the course of a "mission". Of course, they had a job opening... (but then they always has an opening...)                        </div>

                            Here are some others:<br/><br/><b>Fluffy Bunny of Evil</b>--this is a term that was bestowed upon my wife by Keith, indicating that she is capable of only minor acts of evil towards another player.<br/><br/><b>Not You!</b>--Admittedly, this is more of a boardgaming term.  Essentially, you use this when you have decided to pick on someone in particular by withholding anything that might possibly be of assistance.  Like this, "Hmm....who is going to get this bonus power card.    Not You!"<br/><br/><b>Going Veteran</b>--Lifted straight from Polaris, this means that a character is on the downward slope of a tragic story.  In a pinch, I suppose that it could refer to yourself on a particular bad day.<br/><br/><b>What dice does this use?</b>--This arose during the stretch of time when we played Unknown Armies on Friday and Rune on Sunday.  Each time we would sit down to play, my wife would have to be reminded of the rules of the game, including what dice were employed in the game and other such things, like her character's name.  Once reminded, it would all come back quickly, but we needed to do it each time.  So now, saying "What dice does this use?" essentially means "I'm totally clueless about how to play this game and don't remember a thing about it, even though we've played it many times."  This phrase is particularly funny when the game in question has no dice.  Like, say, Nobilis.<br/><br/><b>Obfuscate</b>--None of us have ever played in a Vampire LARP, but we all know the crossed-arm symbol for Obfuscate.  So, every so often, one of us will cross his arms and say, "You can't see me."                        </div>

                            Crumbs, where do I begin?<br/><br/><b>I cast "detect PC"</b> probably needs no explanation.  More lately we are reminded of that scene is The Gamers where the party meet Magellan, the newly rolled up mage.  "You seem like a trustworthy sort, will you join us?"<br/><br/><b>The Collumbo Gambit</b> or <b>Pulling a Collumbo</b> is the phrase for "A plan which is clearly fucking stupid, because there are much easier ways to achieve the same results".  This gem comes from a game a couple of years ago where the players decided to infiltrate an underground complex hidden in a storm drain and manned by brainwashed hobos.  In order to diguise themselves, the players stole raincoats from the set of Collumbo: The Next Generation whch one of the PCs had some tenuous connection to.  Instead of, y'know, just going to oxfam or something.<br/><br/><b>(Anakin) Affleck's Humvee</b> is any daft, pimped-out vehicle.  "Eurocar 2000 with 3 hardpoints?  Whoa, Affleck's Humvee!"  Comes from the same campaign.  The players needed to take a trip into the desert outside Las Vegas, so they stole Anakin Affleck's Humvee.  Which made more sense if you were there.  The humvee had custom everything and the players raided the minibar on the way out to a secret military base.  The session ended with one of the PCs leaning out the back and using his Sonic Blast power pointing backwards to push the vehicle faster so they could outrun the shockwave from an underground nuclear explosion.  Which was pretty cool.<br/><br/><b>Banjoing</b> I owe to Scott Dorwood.  It means "using a totally inappropriate trait in a conflict because you don't want to lose".  Apparently it come from a game of Dog in the Vineyard where one of the PCs was in an argument with an NPC and was losing, so decide to pull out his banjo (which he had a trait for of 2d6 or something) and use the power of a touching ballad to get his point across.<br/><br/><b>How hard can it be?</b>  This probably needs no explanation.  "The Tremere says he needs some alligator claws for a potion.  We're in New Orleans, right?  There's the swamp nearby, that has alligator in, right?  We'll steal a boat and get some meat to catch an alligator.  <b>How hard can it be?</b>"<br/><br/><b>Gang-up bonus</b> is one of Claire's.  Ever since we played Savage Worlds where multiple allies attacking the same person get a to hit bonus called a Gang-up bonus, se asks for one in all kinds of systems and circumstances.  "I want to persuade the Wax King to let us go.  The others are here too, do I get a gang-up bonus?"                        </div>

<b>KIAMO</b> (Pronounced "key-AH-mo", and usually cried out.)  This is an acronym that became a word -- it stands for "Kill It And Move On" and started in the distant shadowy past of my high-school DnD days where the players would interrupt a large block of lovingly crafted box-text description with "We Kill It and Move On, damn!"  I made the mistake of recounting that story to my current group of gamers, who immediately adopted it (though these days it tends to be used to kickstart the session or to interrupt "system plumbing" and rules discussion.                        </div>

Now see we also using <b>banjoing</b>, but for something utterly different. Gaz, one of my group, has a huge vocabulary of words meaning "to bust down the door and give everyone a good kicking," including <b>banjo</b>, <b>knack</b> and so on.                        </div>

<blockquote>A character with Provision can always produce on demand any portable, everyday item that could reasonably have been expected to be needed, such as a coil of rope, a sewing kit or a flint and steel; in addition, with a character who has the Secret of Provision in your group, you will only run out of food if stranded unexpectedly in a situation which prevents you from obtaining food for a period of at least two weeks, or if robbed of your provisions. On a successful Woodscraft ability check, a character with the Secret of Provision can also find nutritious food in the forest or wilderness, sufficient for all members of the group.</blockquote> </div>

                            We were very impressed with the frequent use of "AWESOME" in the Durham3 podcast, and borrowed said exclamation for a while, before we somehow turned to different kinds of food to express our enthusiasm with moments of sheer genius in gaming. All-time favorites include "LEBERWURST" (liverwurst) and "SCHOKO UND KEKS" (chocolate and cookies, a popular cocolate flavor in Germany). Recently, "TOTALE ARBEITSENTFREMDUNG"  ("total alienation of labor") seems to gain popularity, though IÂ´ve no idea where the vaguely marxist reference stems from.                        </div>

                            "Splut" - Used by my high school gaming friends...okay mostly by me...semi-onomatopoeia of someone being killed.

He's not speaking or doing anything, but he is still present.  It was said instead of using brain power to come up with an in game excuse for why the character wasn't present.<br/><br/>"Shoes" - This is my favorite and it has sadly fallen into disuse in my group.  It came from the phrase "waiting for the other shoe to drop."  Something big or ominous that expected to happen became known as a "shoe".  Typical usages: "That shoe is gonna get you."  "I have so many shoes hovering over my head I need a closet for them."  "I just know there is a shoe around the corner waiting to kick my ass."                        </div>
