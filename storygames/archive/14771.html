Throughout the text, keep in mind that I have applied this to "traditional" RPGs.<br/><br/>Before I go into the methodology per se, here's a bit of background on why I came up with it. Playing one-shots of traditional RPGs, I quickly discovered that I could put the scenarios into four distinct categories: meandering messes, spectator-mode railroadfests, awesome gaming experiences, and almost-awesome gaming experiences. To see all scenarios I played fall squarely within one of those four categories puzzled me, and I tried to understand why that was by designing one-shots of my own.<br/><br/>Quickly, I came to the conclusion that railroadfests were, well, too railroady. More interestingly, I came to the conclusion that meandering messes were not railroady enough, and as a result failed to tell a compelling story. It became pretty obvious, then, that awesome and almost-awesome gaming experiences fell somewhere in-between. This was an obvious conclusion, but a challenging one. As someone taking part in gaming discussions online since the 90s, my hatred of railroading was pretty much encoded in my gaming personna. Thus, thinking about an amount of railroading as desireable was unsettling to say the least.<br/><br/>I eventually came up with a satisfying answer on why some amount of railroading was desireable in one-shots. It's the time constraint, you see. Telling a story that has a beginning, a middle and an end within 4 hours is hard, moreso when you want the players to impact the storyline, and even more so when you want some sort of thematic meaning to tie it all together.<br/><br/>So armed with this koan-like notion that a good one-shot is "railroady but not railroady", I designed a methodology geared towards creating good one-shot scenarios within the framework of traditional RPGs. Or, more accurately, I got better and better at designing them and eventually realized that I was using the same methodology every time.<br/><br/>Basically, my method is that you have three set variables that you need to address in the scenario design. There's no order in the way these are adressed, but they're meant to be looked at back and forth until you feel they fit together so well they might be legos.<br/><br/><b>The Frame</b> is made up of all the railroady bits in the scenario. It's everything the players can't impact, can't have power over, ect. <b>The Gamescape</b> is the aspects of the scenario can impact, can have power over, etc. <b>The Theme</b> is what you say as you complete this sentence: "This is the story of..."<br/><br/>Now, the variables themselves are nothing special, and it's the way they interact with each other that's important.<br/><br/><b>The Frame</b> is purely meant to provide context to the Gamescape. It is meant to provide flavor to the Gamescape (the setting) and to push back the players towards interacting with the gamescape. Make it flavorful, but do not make it interesting, because that lures the players away from the Gamescape. If you need to do exposition, make it short, because lingering in the Frame robs it of its purpose, which is to push the players in the Gamescape. Also, make sure no element in the frame requires the players to interact with it to make it work (like an NPC that requires a specific question to be asked to him in order to spew exposition.) If it requires interaction, either ditch it or find a way to make it part of the Gamescape.<br/><br/><b>The Gamescape</b> is made of choices. Every single element in the Gamescape should be made of choices. If the scenario relies on the players making choice A instead of choice B to work, toss it into the Frame. Likewise, if the players picking A or B makes no difference, then it's not a choice and you should toss it into the Frame as well. Also, if the choice is obvious or one of the options is not interesting, cut it or toss it into the Frame. (If you've tossed a lot of stuff into the Frame, remember to work through it again.) At the same time, choices should be obvious. I mean, the choice itself shouldn't, but the fact that you have to choose should. If it's not, tweak the frame. And above all, make sure more game time is spent on the Gamescape than it is on the Frame.<br/><br/><b>The Theme</b> is meant to amplify meaning in both the Gamescape and the Frame. Write down your "this is the story of..." sentence. Elements of context should be featured obviously in the Frame, and elements of actions should be what happens in the Gamescape. If you feel you have too much stuff in your Frame (which is likely to happen at first pass), cut away stuff based on what's furthest away from the theme. While you're at it, make sure you cut away or change stuff in the Frame which clashes with the Theme. In terms of Gamescape, cut away as many choices as you can that do not tell the story of the Theme sentence, or turn them into choices that do. It's also useful to look at how actions are "focussed on" in your sentence. "This is the story of Dude and Gal, and how they killed their dad" tells you the Gamescape is going to be made of tactical choices and/or practical choices, while "This is the story of Dude and Gal, and why they killed their dad" tells you it's going to be made of ethical or personal choices. It doesn't mean all the choices will fall within one or the other, but the bulk of them will. It's fine if you have a mix of the two, as long as every choice relates to the Theme sentence. Finally, make sure the Theme sentence gives a general idea of how the scenario ends, or what final question is answered, if you will. In order for the Theme to be satisfying, it needs to be resolved. Knowing about that resolution informs both what you put into your Gamescape and your Frame. In either area, if something lures the players away from taking part in that resolution, cut it. At the same time, however, make sure that other choices are still meaningful, and that resolution is not the only interesting choice that is made throughout the game.<br/><br/>Like I said, this all ends up being a back and forth process. You cut stuff from the Gamescape because it doesn't support the Theme, and then you realize that your Frame is too bloated, so you cut stuff away from the Frame, which makes you realize that where the Gamescape lies isn't obvious, which makes you retweak the Frame, etc.<br/><br/>Does it always work?  Yes and no. I've done some one-shots I wasn't happy with using this methodology. Here is why I know it is sound, however: every time I've been unhappy with a way a one-shot turned out at playtest (or a one-shot I played in), I've always been able to attribute my insatisfaction to one of the variables. The main reasons were...<br/><br/>(1) The Frame was too bloated.<br/>(2) The Frame was not interesting enough.<br/>(3) The Frame did not push the players into the Gamescape enough.<br/>(4) The Frame was not coherent with the Theme.<br/>(5) The Gamescape choices were not fun to make.<br/>(6) The Gamescape choices felt forced (instead of being a logical conclusion of the Frame)<br/>(7) The Gamescape choices did not connect with the Theme and therefore lacked meaning.<br/>(8) The Theme was not interesting enough.<br/>(9) There was not enough time to actualize the Theme.<br/><br/>That last one takes us back to the fact that it's a one-shot. You have now distilled your idea into a story that's tellable within a four hours span, but how do you make sure you get to the end? After all, you're investing most of your play time in the Gamescape, and that means letting the players influence the tempo. Well, there's no easy solution for this one. Playtest is best, and I've found that having a couple of scenes that deal with the Theme sentence but are not essential to get to the resolution are useful, because I can cut or keep them depending on the pace at which the story is advancing.<br/><br/>Oh, and as a final note, let me stress the usefulness of pre-gens. They're a super useful part of the frame, because you can start the players off with motivations to adress the Theme and/or interesting mechanical choices to make in the Gamescape.<br/><br/>Soooo... that's pretty much it. Hopefully, you guys find this interesting / useful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336009/#Comment_336009" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-25T18:46:59+00:00" title="July 25, 2011  6:46PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it be possible to provide an example of how you prep a one-shot using this technique?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336010/#Comment_336010" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-25T18:53:07+00:00" title="July 25, 2011  6:53PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really cool stuff, Jocelyn!

In my opinion and experience, many indie games are great as one-shots and it's obvious right away how their mechanics are neat and innovative, but they only really and truly shine over a longer haul.  The 4-hour time limit really forces you to focus if you want to get anything done\u2014your methodology is a means of distillation when running games that don't provide it for you.

Giving an example would pretty much require designing a one-shot, which I lack time for.<br/><br/>What I can tell you, though, is that I usually start off with the most obvious variable, depending on my initial impulsion to run a one-shot. If my initial impulsion is to play in this or that setting, I'll start with the Frame. If it's to play with this or that system, I'll start with the Gamescape, building one that promotes interaction with the system. And sometimes, I feel the desire to play a story about this and that, which means I'll start with the Theme.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>This is absolutely great stuff and makes a ton of sense.

In that sense, players enjoy almost-complete freedom to do whatever... within the realm of a certain category of choice, or two categories at most.<br/><br/>A couple of examples from one-shots I've run might help.<br/><br/>"Sacrifices of War", using <i>Savage Worlds</i>: A scenario set in the Dark Sun universe, the Gamescape was all about tactical choices and how ruthless they were willing to be in those choices.<br/><br/>"Kitchen Nightmare", using <i>Unknown Armies</i>: The Gamescape was all about the players' reaction to the weirdness they encountered, and whether they embraced it or rejected it.<br/><br/>"Meditations on the Abyss", using <i>Aletheia</i>: The Gamescape was about investigation, solving the mystery, etc.<br/><br/>But you're right that the Gamescape can be too narrow, and when that happens, it does feel artificial.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I'd like an example of your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> reason if you can think of one, please.</blockquote>\nFrom the Frame, it's supposed to be obvious what type of choices you're supposed to make (the Gamescape). In my last example, for instance, it should be obvious to the players that they should put their energy into Investigation-type choices. If it's not, then the scenario is in trouble because the confusion will eat up playtime.<br/><br/>Is that clearer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336051/#Comment_336051" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-26T06:18:18+00:00" title="July 26, 2011  6:18AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2011 6:21AM by Graham.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not really!

Another group of rebels led by a disgruntled noble was about to attack the sorcerer-king. The leadership of the PCs group had decided that he had no chance in his attempt, and that the sorcerer-king's higher vigilance to rebels afterwards would likely thwart <i>their</i> plan.

The Gamescape was made up of decisions relating either to how things were achieved or whether they were willing to sacrifice innocents to achieve it. The Frame related to the Theme because of the essential "dog-eat-dog" nature of the Dark Sun setting, and because the set-up was all about the Veiled Alliance sacrificing an inconvenient ideological ally because he was an obstacle to their plan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336064/#Comment_336064" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-26T08:35:32+00:00" title="July 26, 2011  8:35AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>To make a long story short of the background, the PCs were members of a rebel group (the Veiled Alliance) plotting to overthrow the city-state's sorcerer-king (Kalak, in the city of Tyr.)

These elements are hardwired in the scenario.<br/><br/>Could they (either individually or as a group) choose to abandon the mission and do something else, or join the noble, or whatever? Yes, <i>but</i>. As a rule, I tell the players upfront at the start of the game that I've tried to make pretty clear where the adventure that I prepped lies. I then assure them that within said adventure, I have prepped so that they have as much freedom of action as possible, and that their choices do no secretly rely on a pre-conceived right way to do things. However, I also tell them that I have no prepped for stuff outside of the adventure, and that the spotlight will not follow if they venture out. In that sense, the players are completely free in my example to ditch the Veiled Alliance and move to the next city or whatever... but that means they've chosen to exit the scenario and the game is done for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336205/#Comment_336205" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-27T20:52:36+00:00" title="July 27, 2011  8:52PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So OK.

One scenario I did ("Kitchen Nightmare", using <i>Unknown Armies</i>) was about the PCs stumbling into occult shenninigans and how they reacted to it (and ultimately, whether they actively embraced the occult world or not). I loaded the character sheets with interesting fiddly bits, but at its core, that scenario's Gamescape was mostly roleplaying + the madness meters, as this was about how the PCs reacted. Whatever skill they used, whatever action they took, it was all welcome if it related to their reaction or positioning on the issue. The Frame in that scenario, then, was all about preventing status quo and making the situation as interesting as possible. The PCs couldn't "do as usual", and I tried to set a Frame that made them want to roleplay reactions.<br/><br/>To me, this sort of sounds similar to what you're talking about.

I'm actually the opposite in campaign mode, and will follow the players wherever they take the story, though. For me, it's not so much a matter of "this is what I'm offering, buy into it or get out"... it's more that there's nothing less satisfying to me than a story that doesn't have a beginning, middle and an end. Within a 4 hours framework, someone needs to be in control to make sure that happens - whereas one more session or one less session in a campaign doesn't change much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336261/#Comment_336261" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T11:37:51+00:00" title="July 28, 2011 11:37AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jocelyn:  Have you heard of the "Adventure Funnel" method of prep?

I've actually found AW a bit awkward to run for one-shots, since its setup, while good and solid, is based on a more meandering sort of situation-building. An AW con game needs something to make it "pop!"<br/><br/>(though funny enough, when I <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">played a con game</a> with you a couple of years ago, it went just great, despite the distinct lack of Framing. But subsequent experience has told me that this was just good fortune*.)<br/><br/>Jocelyn, have your read or played <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a>? It's an awesome free game that does exactly the sort of thing you're talking about: There's a strong Frame complete with pregen characters and starting situation (You're the Lady Blackbird traveling incognito to your pirate lover, plus bodyguard and smuggler crew. You're captured by Imperial Warship and begin play in the brig). There's simple but flexible Gamescape through the Keys (each player has an incentive toward certain kinds of choices through their character's often contradictory Keys--the Captain to give orders and take decisive action, to show his love for the Lady without letting on that he cares, and to get in trouble as an outlaw, for instance. Or he can forever renounce one or all of those and take a new direction!). The Gamescape is also aided by the dicerolling system, which makes wild stunts and bold action possible, but failure fairly likely--where failure just puts you into an even more interesting and sticky situation. The Theme of Lady Blackbird would be something like "this is the story of how the Lady Blackbird flew in disguise with a smuggler crew to meet her lover, the Pirate King Uriah Flint, and whether she still wanted him by the time she got there." (I'm finding it hard to craft a succinct theme statement that incorporates all the characters, though. You almost need a different one for each!)<br/><br/>I point this out not to school you or show that "it's been done," but to celebrate how you've broken down these techniques! John Harper, for instance, does these great pick-up-and play designs like LB, and here you are laying out exactly how to do what he does, with any game. That is hot. Folks, do you realize that John Harper + Jocelyn Robitaille = WE ARE ALL JOHN HARPER?<br/><br/>And Jocelyn, you're right that this can be applied to a game system regardless of whether its rules are slanted toward this kind of play. Some games have tools built into them that rev up a focused situation, like Keys, which I love (and which John swiped from the game <a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/" rel="nofollow">Shadow of Yesterday</a>). But even if a game's rules are just skills plus spells plus HP or whatever, this technique looks like it can bring the focus and coherence necessary for a satisfying con game. I like that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>This is absolutely great stuff and makes a ton of sense.  However, it sounds like a lot of work</blockquote>\nI kind of agree--it is work, but the good kind. This is the kind of work that is required for most con games, but which I've struggled aimlessly with for the last few years. Several of the games on your list are designed for long-term play and still require a lot of work! There are some games that are self-contained and bring their own Framing Process, like Lady Blackbird, Fiasco, 1001 Nights, but I'd say they're in the minority. This technique gives me tools to expand that quality into about any game I care to run, and that's exciting.<br/><br/>Thanks, Jocelyn! I'll definitely be using this techniques for my next con!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/><br/>*Where "good fortune" = "Vincent Baker's MCing technique &gt; Joel Shempert's MCing technique." <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336352/#Comment_336352" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T07:13:24+00:00" title="July 29, 2011  7:13AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2011 7:13AM by Millsy.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really useful stuff, Jocelyn.

It's a shame there's not more advice out there on prepping the one-shot, as I find I'm playing many more short-term and one-shot games than long campaigns. I think it must be my age. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\n-Guy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336500/#Comment_336500" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-31T05:16:04+00:00" title="July 31, 2011  5:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: graypawn</cite>Jocelyn:  Have you heard of the "Adventure Funnel" method of prep?</blockquote>\nI hadn't until you linked to it. It's interesting, but it feels to me more like something you use to generate an idea than something you use to streamline if for a one-shot. In that sense, I get the feeling you could totally pull something out of the funnel, and then run it through my method. It'd be an interesting experiment, in any case.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: graypawn</cite>As best i can predict, the ultimate variable in designing any session, one-shot or otherwise, is related the most to how well you know your players.  How a singular GM responds to the people joining her is a hard thing to balance.  No amount of 'on the spot is my forte 2d10' or 'pre-prepped=prepared: five dots' will overcome sitting at a table with two winners and a weirdo that spins your head so fast it travels back in time.  You'll be caught between synergy and a constant "wtf?" ringing in your head.  (this is a vivid babbling about my own experiences, again, mileage may vary, forgive me if i speak out of turn...)</blockquote>\nI dunno. I've run one-shots with a lot of strangers, and haven't encountered this since I've began using / refining my method. Maybe I have just been lucky, but my instinct tells me that channeling a table's roleplay in a tightly focused way in the way my method does probably tends to tone out weirdos, as they are put to work on something concrete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336501/#Comment_336501" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-31T05:24:48+00:00" title="July 31, 2011  5:24AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite><br><br><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>This is absolutely great stuff and makes a ton of sense.

Playing around with one-shots, I quickly discovered that to get a scenario I was satisfied with, I had to invest way more work than for a whole freaking campaign. During a campaign, you know the players and the characters, so it's easier to lock onto them and "stimulate" meaning, especially when you have all the time in the world. With a one-shot, it's a "beat the clock" deal, where you have a very limited time to produce a meaningful story <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with strangers</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while teaching the game</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without disempowering the players</span> and just telling them your own meaningful story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336546/#Comment_336546" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-31T15:53:19+00:00" title="July 31, 2011  3:53PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Robitaille Triforce.<br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/graypawn/5995371675/" rel="nofollow" title="OneShotTriForce by Graypawn, on Flickr"><img alt="OneShotTriForce" height="375" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6003/5995371675_cb5192c192_o.jpg" width="375"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336554/#Comment_336554" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-31T18:05:02+00:00" title="July 31, 2011  6:05PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, I always wanted one of these.
