For a short while, the giantfolk can visit the ground to trade and mingle before the creature wakes up. <br/><br/>To the people living on the creature there are two worlds. The familiar and constant soft and furry world of the town set in the fur of the creature, and the ever changing, moving world of the ground. The world of the ground is always different , forever changing as the creature continues walking onwards. The creature folk are forever moving this way, but also forever rooted to the creature.<br/><br/><b>Intent</b><br/>I want to explore how life on the creature is. To explore their world and use that in context of my own worldview to gain a better understanding of myself. <br/><br/><br/>Does the townfolk ever feel trapped? Do their youth run away to the unknown ground world? Does the town traditionally reproduce with people from the ground world to increase their gene pool? What does the ground world think of the creature? What if a city is trampled down, does people get angry and what do they do about it? What happens when they meet another creature with a townt? What if their giant is a predator, for example a spider? <br/>Those are some potential plotlines set in this world. For now I am still creating the world and establishing just how it works though!<br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/wPZDKzw.png"/><br/><i>View from a small settlement on the edge of the giant. </i><br/><br/><b>What do you want from me? </b><br/>I am involving you in the development of Rooted, if you would like to! <br/><br/><b>Here is how it works; </b><br/>Every week or every other week, I will post a new update on the project. I will give you guys a script, a comic, a prototype or simply some artwork. In the same run, I will provide a feedback form, you will hopefully give feedback, and based on your feedback I will pivot accordingly! <br/><br/><br/>While I have a vision, I believe it is important to listen to your audience and iterate from there. If you\u2019re into it, I would love to take your opinion into consideration. <br/><br/><b>Okay, let me join!</b><br/>You can leave some feedback and sign up as a tester here - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs_tElhyRJ2VJ0tuiVjBKdcRynAH2Zihld8DfQm_xjpVZe9Q/viewform" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs_tElhyRJ2VJ0tuiVjBKdcRynAH2Zihld8DfQm_xjpVZe9Q/viewform</a> <br/><br/><b>Who are you?</b><br/>My name is Sebastian Larsson.

Will they see it as a kind of kaiju and try to destroy it? I suppose a lot depends on the beast's behavior; how intelligent is it, and does it avoid damaging structures? When it eats, does it shovel up a whole town's worth of crops (or herd animals) in one mouthful?<br/><br/>Also, the logistics of climbing up and down would be interesting. Could practically be an adventure in their own right. (See the video game "Shadow Of The Colossus", which is mostly made up of boss battles where you have to climb up the boss to its weak spot.)<br/><br/>(I'm reminded of Christopher Priest's novel "The Inverted World", because that's also about a mobile town that's always traveling. It's <i>very</i> different, though: dark post-apocalyptic SF with some weird twists. The city has to keep moving because the world is disintegrating behind it, or sort of but not really; it's hard to explain.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457741/#Comment_457741" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-01T01:33:39+00:00" title="November  1, 2016  1:33AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What else lives on the creature?

If you can manage to load and unload the goods while the creature is still awake.<br/><br/>The creature's poop would be pretty ... epic. Suddenly there's a new hill! It smells awful but it's amazing for growing crops on! Sorry about your cattle, though...

I think in the village they have a crew who continually shaves the fur to create pathways people can walk on without trouble. The fur is then processed and turned into textiles by a different crew. Past the town there are areas with longer hair which towers over people, like a forest of hair. I guess one could technically walk on top of the fur as well with the right equipment..kinda like snow boots? \n<blockquote>Lovely!<br/><br/>What do they do with the hair that starts growing under/inside their home? <br/><br/>Can they use it as fuel?

I suggest that whatever wood they can obtain by trading with the outside world suffices for house building.<br/>In fact, since the creature-dwellers are a small community and the creature itself doesn't - in terms of living space - afford them unlimited growth, it's safe to say their number stays small, by whatever means (emigration?): the town grows slowly. Thus, expanding the town by building a new house is an infrequent event, not an everyday occurrence: stockpiled wood from foreign trade is sufficient to meet such an infrequent demand, plus maintenance.<br/>I figure sometimes, because of hair regrowing from under the floor or other skin conditions or events, a house has to be moved - a form of maintenance. A new spot is cleared and the existing house is disassembled, the pieces transferred to the new site and the house rebuilt anew, in the new location, re-using most of the same wood. Any damaged or exceedingly worn parts - and those only - are replaced with new ones when rebuilding, while most components are recovered and reused.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458048/#Comment_458048" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-13T01:20:44+00:00" title="November 13, 2016  1:20AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Minniska">@Minniska</a><br/>I know you are thinking about taking this in a lot of directions.

So many things to define</blockquote>\nIf you have ever heard of a tabletop role-playing game (such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons), Story Games are a form of those. The difference being that in Story Games the story tends to be created collaboratively among the players and the rules tend to be simpler. In the most basic sense, a Story Game is a game where a group of people get together and tell a story using some rules and usually an element of chance (dice, a deck of cards, drawing tokens, or the like).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458056/#Comment_458056" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-13T12:49:27+00:00" title="November 13, 2016 12:49PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just read about it and love the setting. Two ideas come to my mind:<br/><br/>First, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faraway_Tree" rel="nofollow">the Faraway Tree by Enid Blyton</a>. It is a wonderful book trilogy with a fairy folk living in a huge tree. The connection to your setting: The huge tree reaches into the clouds and every once in a while, another (magical) country/world appears on the top of the tree. Thus, the habitants have their usual small world with their tiny houses on the tree. Plus, they get to spend adventures in the crazy worlds appearing on the top of the tree.<br/>I can highly recommend these books and I think it could be useful inspiration for your setting.<br/><br/>Another thing that comes to my mind is the <a href="http://kotohi.com/ryuutama/" rel="nofollow">Japanese RPG Ryuutama</a>.

Normal-sized humans, giant creature: The creature could easily leap over a river and would have to eat tons of plants etc. Easier to model realistic human physics, easier for humans to interact with outside world.<br/>B. Tiny humans, normal-sized creature: Creature can behave like a normal animal in natural environment or outside world.

My perspective of what a storygame is varies from you guys - I originally just thought a story game was a videogame where the main pleasure comes from experiencing the story (For example The stanley parable, Gone home, Telltale's series, etc) but clearly I have been missing an entire genre of games. I'll have to look into and play some story games, they sound amazing.

As of now I am hoping to explore the world through a multitude of different mediums. The idea is to define what I want to express, find the best medium to convey it with, and use that.

I took a break from writing stories to answer some of your questions. Hope you find the answers satisfactory! I've made the answers in <b>bold</b> and the questions in quotes. <br/><br/>--------------\n<blockquote>Does the fur do anything interesting when it gets rained on? Does it block rain? Soak it up? Smell funny?</blockquote>\n<b>The hair does block rain, making it great for house building. The water will travel on top of the hair until it reaches a place where it may rest, like a flat area for example.<br/><br/>This is handy because one can set up hairs to lead to pools which can act as a water resource. </b><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/QHNBfHa.png"/><br/><b>The water follows the hair to where it leads - in this case conveniently to a reservoir of water - a shaved patch of fur surrounded by waterproof structure (rock?). Of course they\u2019d have to filter it somehow..hmm.</b><br/><br/><b>The hair also becomes slightly damp making it smell a bit. However the creature folk are of course used to it and simply calls it the smell of rain - similar to how we call wet dirt the smell of rain. </b>\n<blockquote>What happens when the creature breaks a sweat? Anyone up atop the fur might not even notice, but if you're in the wrong shaved area, do you get flooded? Or are there collection devices (are large volumes of salt water useful for something)?</blockquote>\n<b>That is..a good question.<br/><br/>I imagine the amount of sweat produced is distributed evenly over the skin and often won\u2019t pour down too far before it evaporates (similar to human sweat), so at most sweat will create smaller streams which are harmless yet spread quite an odour. <br/><br/>Shaved areas should not be too affected since they\u2019re naturally cooled due to the lack of fur. </b>\n<blockquote>"Does anything else escape the creature's pores, like scents from strong foods it eats?</blockquote>\n<b>Spontaneous answer; Yup!  Maybe they could harvest spices by distilling sweat? Will have to look into this. </b>\n<blockquote>Does the creature attract any skin parasites like fleas? If these are also giant, do the people try to kill them for the good of the creature, or leave them alone because they're dangerous, or what?</blockquote>\n<b>In Rooted the giants are giant and everything else is \u201cnormal\u201d sized. There are lots of parasites but not gigantic ones. I need to research this a bit more before answering this completely. Maybe the townsfolk needs to protect the creature. Surely there could be rats living on the creature or maybe a type of wolf? Pests that has to be dealt with. </b>\n<blockquote>What about other skin events like pimples, cuts, infections, bites from giant mosquitoes, etc.? When the creature's blood comes to the surface, is that useful or dangerous or something else?</blockquote>\n<b>Good question about the blood. I\u2019d love to add some mystical aspect to it specifically paid for by creature flesh and blood, will continue thinking about this. </b>\n<blockquote>What's the creature's body temperature like? It is comfortable, temperature-wise, for the people to be on its skin? On its fur? Does this change between day/night, winter/summer, moving/still? Does the creature ever hibernate?</blockquote>\n<b>Similar to cows and Yak\u2019s, the creature\u2019s body temperature is consistently around 38 Celcius, or 101 F. It\u2019s quite comfortable, leading to villagers rarely wearing shoes. The people would know something was wrong if the temperature sunk, for example if the creature got sick. <br/><br/>The creature sleeps every few months. There are legends that the creature has hibernated for several years in the past but no one living has experienced it. Yet </b>\n<blockquote>Does the creature ever get sick? Cold? Fever? Sneezes/coughs?</blockquote>\n<b>Nope, the creature has lived for a very long time and has built up a stable resistance to most diseases. There would have to be a pretty spectacular parasite for it to become sick. Ill-meaning humans for example. </b>\n<blockquote>Does the creature ever get startled or scared or angry or eager or anything else that'd cause sudden/violent motion? Do the people have any structures or procedures for dealing with this? Tightly braided, hair-only quake shelters? Techniques for helping their homes and other stuff survive?</blockquote>\n<b>The creature is quite calm in general - there would have to be a very good reason for it to behave outside its usual habits.<br/><br/>However the creature will sometimes lower their head to graze on forests and other edible things. This forces the small mining town atop the creature\u2019s head to be specifically built for stability and for them to work on a set schedual - ideally when the creature is not grazing. <br/><br/>The creature will also lay down on its stomach when it is time to sleep. The creature folk prepare for this by fastneing their belongings and holding on. </b>\n<blockquote>Compared to our human world, does it happen that the creature is giant-sized and the humans (or humanoids) are normal sized? Or is the giant creature a normal size animal compared to the surrounding nature and the humans just happen to be tiny?</blockquote>\n<b>The creatures are giant! Everything else is normal sized. Humans, normal animals, etc. That being said there are multiple giant creatures.. </b> <br/>\n<blockquote>You might enjoy this article; it seems to touch on similar themes, and your potential game or product could be a good fit for the demographic being discussed.</blockquote>\n<b>I read this the other week and it gave me shivers. I'm not sure what I can add to the mix but will try my best to produce honest and accessible content that inspires people to do the same.</b>\n<blockquote>This is pretty interesting; I immediately envision a small group who live on the Beast who are unhappy with this arrangement.

I'm not hitting on any particularly obvious game that would make the road from concept to execution particularly straightforward, though. Part of it is the existentialist slice of life world-building sense-of-wonder vibe, encouraging of some sort of relaxed doll-house Sim play; we've known for a decade at least that the gaming tools for that sort of thing are sparse and deficient, but a killer app hasn't really made an appearance yet, as far as I know.

No particular synergy there, particularly with the highly structured mission-based playstyle of MG. What I would like to have would be an <i>Ars Magica</i> with more generic mechanics, in fact - that would be just about perfect for this sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mnniska" title="Mnniska"><img alt="Mnniska" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nD4DLAWMJE1ZJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mnniska">Mnniska</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458869/#Comment_458869" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-29T07:39:28+00:00" title="December 29, 2016  7:39AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like it very much!

All it'd take to shift this closer to <i>Bone</i> or <i>Elfquest</i> or some such family-friendly adventure story would be to posit some protagonists and a Grand Adventure, with evils to vanquish - would be instantly more familiar in tone to many, I think.<br/><br/>(I wouldn't hazard a guess as to whether that's where Sebastian's going, of course. So far it seems that he's enamoured with the world-building, and that comes through to his audience as well, so for all I know this project might ride on that alone, without needing any One Rings to destroy and Evils to vanquish. We're living an age of existential storytelling anyways, we all love this shit.)<br/><br/>Incidentally what this reminds me of most is European comics of the 20th century, and certain American underground trends, too. It's got that cuteness and flavour emphasis.

For example <i>Shock</i>, with the shock being living on the creature (that's basically how the first chapter in a <i>Human Contact</i> game works anyway). Or <i>Kingdom</i>, with the kingdom being the community living on the creature. I can also imagine adapting something like <i>The Quiet Year</i>. <i>Fifth World</i> could also work, by skipping most of its regular (world-building) setup.<br/>Hacking <i>Ganakagok</i> (by designing custom tarots) or <i>How We Came to Live Here</i> would be a lot more work, as would making a *World similar to <i>Sagas of the Icelanders</i>, but these games too all make use of a tightly defined cultural background and focus on interpersonal conflicts inherent in the background itself (families do quarrel) with strong man-vs-nature survival issues as an accelerator - while not falling for the simplistic view of overall rejecting the way of life depicted.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458937/#Comment_458937" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-31T15:01:48+00:00" title="December 31, 2016  3:01PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, those are some excellent suggestions.

Something free and digital makes sense, as a casual interest might not justify buying something.<br/><br/>With those features in mind, here's a few recommendations - I'll limit myself to immediately available free titles in the belief that it's better to check out a few possibly less than ideal games yourself rather than purchase something possibly better sight unseen; reading a few of these will give you a sense for what story games (drama-oriented progressive-design rpgs, to be specific) are like. You should read these a bit yourself and see if any of them might be to your tastes and playable at your skill level. I bolded a few that may prove particularly illuminating, but they're all games that at least some people have been excited about.<br/><br/><a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a><br/><a href="https://isabout.wordpress.com/fables-of-camelot/" rel="nofollow">Fables of Camelot</a><br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">Ghost/Echo</a><br/><a href="http://www.greatorkgods.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Great Orc Gods</a><br/><a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to Host a Dungeon</a><br/><b><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a></b><br/><a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/nicotinegirls.html" rel="nofollow">Nicotine Girls</a><br/><a href="http://storygames.pbworks.com/f/otherkind.pdf" rel="nofollow">Otherkind</a><br/><b><a href="http://www.jwarts.com/thepoolrpg.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Pool</a></b><br/><b><a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_puppetland_www.html" rel="nofollow">Puppetland</a></b><br/><a href="https://seadracula.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Sea Dracula</a><br/><a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Yesterday / Solar System</a><br/><a href="http://irontavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Swords-Wizardry-Complete-revised.pdf" rel="nofollow">Swords &amp; Wizardry</a><br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/wildlings/wildlings.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Wildlings</a><br/><a href="http://silverpath.pbworks.com/f/open_reloaded_basic.pdf" rel="nofollow">Wushu</a><br/><br/>As you might imagine, commercial titles will generally have more rounded-out quality in all areas. I'll let others suggest specific titles, though. There's a lot of variety out there, so a good recommendation would depend on your tastes and level of facility with this stuff. For example, if <i>The Pool</i>, listed above, seems utterly cryptic to you, or straightforwardly playable, that'll have implications on what further recommendations would make sense.<br/><br/>So yeah, check out some of those and let us know what you think - it'll make it easier to make more specific recommendations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459098/#Comment_459098" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-08T23:10:54+00:00" title="January  8, 2017 11:10PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent post from Eero, there. I'd say that "picking a story game" - unfortunately - will have a lot to do with the skillset of the players involved. (Which is likely something you don't know anything about, not having done it, or at least done it with them, yet.) Each game provides different tools while expecting you to do the rest of the work yourself, so each one applies differently to a different set of skills or affinities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459194/#Comment_459194" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-12T00:55:04+00:00" title="January 12, 2017 12:55AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Starting a brand new thread" might actually prove a great idea.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's be pragmatic and start with some practical considerations.

How much extra time can you - just you - individually commit to figuring a game out before trying it?<br/>That's the sort of useful information which can narrow the list of suggestions down, for a starter, before we even get into the very important consideration of subject matter (knowing who you're likely to play with usually comes first, because everybody needs be interested in the subject matter).<br/><br/>Additionally, some people around here might be up for playing on the Internet, via video chat or whatever (not my cup of tea, but enthusiasts abound).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mnniska" title="Mnniska"><img alt="Mnniska" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nD4DLAWMJE1ZJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mnniska">Mnniska</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459326/#Comment_459326" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-16T17:13:38+00:00" title="January 16, 2017  5:13PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2017 5:15PM by Mnniska.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi guys, thanks a ton for your suggestions.
