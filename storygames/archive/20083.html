I've played a bunch of Blades, so if you have any specific questions, let me know!<br/><br/>But let me try and answer some resolution questions:<br/><br/>Blades is a game about fictional positioning: there's a lot more input before the dice get thrown down than AW. You input in:<br/><br/>The obstacle<br/>The character's method of action<br/>The desired effect<br/><br/>and that gets you out a position, which is one of three:<br/>Controlled, Risky, Desperate.<br/>(there's also a secret fourth which is: "It doesn't seem like you can accomplish that, so how do you create an opportunity to make that happen?", where the roll is then about that opportunity)<br/><br/>The position you get has a huge impact on your likelihood of success, so there's a lot of pressure to try and put yourself into good, controlled situations. As the heist goes all to hell, you find yourself under more and more pressure.<br/><br/>Blades is a roll Xd6, take the best. You get dice for the relevant skill (0-2 dice for starting characters), 1 if your target matches your background (criminal, elite, etc), 1 for taking personal stress, 1 for accepting the Devil's Bargain (a GM's tempting complication). <br/><br/>6's are success, multiple 6's a crit, 4-5 partial, 1-3 failure. But a controlled failure is so so much better.<br/><br/>To avoid overplanning, there's downtime phases where you build pools and resources that you can then spend during the heist as teamwork or other info. There's also a lot of enthusiasm for: "Okay, let's flashback to how I gathered information about the basement by infiltrating the cooking staff."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443877/#Comment_443877" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T07:23:26+00:00" title="March 10, 2015  7:23AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2015 7:24AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love everything about this, except for this:\n<blockquote>To avoid overplanning, there's downtime phases where you build pools and resources that you can then spend during the heist as teamwork or other info.

You get mechanical resources and then slap fiction onto them when needed?  I hope I'm reading you wrong.  The planning is my favorite part of scheme &amp; heist stories and play.  I want to benefit from coming up with amazing plans, and suffer from coming up with less-amazing ones.  Without that, to me it's an action game.<br/><br/>On the positive front: is there a formula for "Ob + Intent + Method -&gt; Controlled/Risky/Desperate", or is it someone's judgment?

If that means your team is coming up with an awesome plan and then you just execute it, that's fine. Retro-play is I think, a lot more about "establishing things that support what's already in the fiction" rather than "revealing twists that swerve the narrative to help us get through problems". (So my example above probably wasn't ideal.)<br/><br/>Like for example, if during downtime, you said: "I'm going to go gather information on the house by becoming a worker." it might make sense to make a roll there and give some information. But also, when on the heist, when it becomes clear that the weird metal door at the end of the third floor hallway is important, we might make a different roll in a flashback to see what info you gathered about that. Or you might have gotten that info up front! A lot of it will be table/situation dependent.<br/><br/><br/>Put Another Way: having good plans is vitally important in Blades, and there's a real sense of that when stuff goes wrong, sticking it out in a shattered plan could be very very bad. Sometimes you just have to try again or give up the job.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443885/#Comment_443885" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T15:42:36+00:00" title="March 10, 2015  3:42PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Controlled/Risky/Desperate -&gt; It's a conversation. If the GM's like: "Well, infiltrating that household sounds pretty risky." The player can push back, or the GM can offer ways in which it might become Controlled, if they say, spread around some bribes, or spent more time.<br/><br/>Oh, also, effect, forgot to mention that. You have dots you put into your assets (gear, connections, tools). Sometimes the effect is obvious from a roll, but sometimes, it makes sense to roll for how much of an effect you have, and that's where the quality of your assets comes into play. Effects often are about inflicting stress or harm on a personal level, or advancing countdown clocks on a larger scale.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443889/#Comment_443889" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T17:26:18+00:00" title="March 10, 2015  5:26PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2015 5:27PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the info, James!  The pacing does sound important, and "losing your Hold" sounds like a perfect way to frame the correct incentive.  <br/><br/>Rolling to see what I've previously learned about the big metal door is fine by me if I earned that roll with prior decisions.  But if the prior decision was simply "I check the place out", with nothing in particular on the line, then I doubt that'd feel meaningful to me.  \n<blockquote>Like for example, if during downtime, you said: "I'm going to go gather information on the house by becoming a worker." it might make sense to make a roll there and give some information.</blockquote>That sounds more like my cup of tea.<br/>\n<blockquote>A lot of it will be table/situation dependent.</blockquote>Gotcha.

You can use that as input, where you say: "Okay, I really need a serious (4 tick) effect, so I can finish this up now, and I'm doing it with brute arcane force", and the GM might be like: "Okay, but that's desperate!"<br/><br/>Or it can be on the other side, where you're spending time deciphering the runes, and you roll for effect (similar type of roll ,just slightly different inputs), to see how much of an effect you had.  If you don't have a big enough effect, then that might put pressure on other people to distract the Lord before he enters the room with you in it, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Reviewing this a little more precisely, teamwork pools can be created with Tactics rolls during downtime, but importantly, you create them by fictionally making a plan. You can call upon Factions you're friendly with to give you teamwork dice (but of course, expect them to demand your help at a later date).<br/><br/>Teamwork dice are the resource that let you say "no, we had a contingency for this happening", but importantly, all teamwork dice are gained through the players describing and making their fictional plan. So the contingencies the PCs use are bound to the fiction they've established.<br/><br/>That reassuring you on the "planning matters"? <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443894/#Comment_443894" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T19:09:41+00:00" title="March 10, 2015  7:09PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, yeah, if someone in downtime was like: "I scope out the house!" there would be several layers of questions before we'd roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443895/#Comment_443895" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-10T20:22:13+00:00" title="March 10, 2015  8:22PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2015 8:27PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still have some concerns, but they're just matters of personal taste, not any sort of critique of the game.  This bit from the Kickstarter page is presented as a selling point; I can't imagine that anyone who jumps at this will be on board for the kind of play I prefer when scheming:\n<blockquote>Many RPG sessions grind to a halt when planning is required. The group ends up discussing options for hours -- talking about the game rather than playing the game. Blades in the Dark cuts through all that with a lightning-fast planning technique that takes <b>less than one minute</b>. You make a few <b>simple</b> decisions and you're off and running. In addition, the players can use their teamwork bonus to activate a contingency plan, which lets them cut to a flashback scene and roll a setup action their character performed in the past.</blockquote>Emphasis mine, for the parts that turn me off.<br/><br/>If your groups have opted to spend more time on establishing fictional constraints for this stuff, though, James, that's cool, I'm sure I'd enjoy playing it with you!

Unfortunately, didn't get too much play-time in the game. We spent most of the first session talking about our crew and what we're trying to accomplish (kinda the point right?). However, we did get a little of in-character play going which is where my question arises from. So our question was, when you roll for an Action, is it always followed by a roll for Effect? If not, in what situation can you omit one step in that process? For example:<br/><br/>We were doing a little flash-back work, describing how the leader of our crew went around inducting each of us into the cult he was forming. At one point, he was trying to charm myself and another PC to join the scientology-type cult we created. He rolled an action roll, it was a 5.  Now, we weren't sure if we should have him roll for effect after that action roll or not. On the one hand, myself and the other PC were obviously not trying to resist this seduction into the crew, cause that's why we're a unit. However, we figured it would be important to determine just how far down the rabbit hole we fell with that initial sales pitch. Were we now die-hard acolytes or did we kinda buy the premise but needed to raise our thetan levels to get more on page with the tenants of the cult? <br/><br/>One of the people in the game said he read somewhere that you're not supposed to roll twice for the same issue in question. But I took that to mean: you roll once for the Action roll and then you roll for the Effect of that action.  Not rolling twice would be a reference to not just retrying a roll because it didn't go the way you wanted. Basically, a PC can't spend 8 rolls trying to get what they want, they roll once and then have to change the situation before they can attempt another roll.<br/><br/>At any rate, we decided on progress clocks to throw our characters further down the rabbit hole. Right now the cult (and party) leader has a decent hold on us, but with a little more work we'll be die-hard believers.<br/><br/>Did I interpret the intention of the rules correctly? Is there anything I'm missing or have incorrect which could be problematic for the future?  Any insight on this would be much appreciated.
