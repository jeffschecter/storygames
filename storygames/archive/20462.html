We've all been playing games together and hanging out for, I dunno, four or five years, maybe. A number of us are deeply interested in ARGs and pervasive games. We've talked about playing <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/84298/De-Profundis-Second-Edition" rel="nofollow">De Profundis</a> and a couple of us have dabbled with <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/brave-sparrow/" rel="nofollow">Brave Sparrow</a>, for instance. Three of them (not me) got really into the whole <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/24/4767700/bear-stearns-bravo-the-fmv-adventure-game-launched-from-internet-memes" rel="nofollow">Bear Stearns Bravo/Pronunciation Book</a> thing when it happened, and I was interested, if not really playing along, with the <a href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lost_Experience" rel="nofollow">Lost ARG stuff</a> that happened way back when. Before I met them, some of them were into (rural) urban exploration (checking out/photographing abandoned houses and the like). They had a friend then who would sometimes seed the places they explored with strange and interesting items and trinkets; they have stories about it. I'd like to go on some adventures, too.<br/><br/><i>Point the second</i>: I just finished running a Dogs in the Vineyard campaign (my first time running/playing DiTV, it was great, I should really write it up but I'm working on fanart for it first). One of the other members has taken over our regular RPG/story game night; he's DMing D&amp;D5. My GMing impulse doesn't just go away, tho, and I'm looking for something else to pour that particular energy into.<br/><br/><i>Conclusion</i>: It might be fun to run a small-scale ARG for the gang! Maybe! What am I getting myself into?!?<br/><br/>So this is extremely early-in-the-process brainstorming (like, it's not much more than daydreaming at this point). Have any of you done anything like this before? Pitfalls? Cool ideas?<br/><br/><b>Some things I want, or want to avoid:</b>\n<ul> <li>I'm not really interested in keeping my involvement secret or maintaining a "could it be real" prank-y feeling (at least, not for long) for a few reasons. One, I don't want to actually scare anyone. Two, the group will probably suspect me very quickly in any mysterious happenings with story-bits, and if confronted I'm incapable of lying with a straight face. That said, if I can make it a kind of open secret, an "everyone assumes it's Jonathan, but what if?" kind of vibe would be ideal. I do think I have a puppet-master partner-in-crime to help with it if I do want to maintain deniability for a while, she is much less likely to be suspected.</li>\n<li>I'd like the nature of the story created to be somewhat collaborative, as opposed to them just solving puzzles for me to fill in the next little bit of the mystery. Not sure how to implement any of that stuff; I ideally want the game to be an invitation to make creative bits and pieces yourself (drawings, photographs, writing, whatever). Failing that I'd at least want there to be some way for the players to make decisions with an impact on the narrative. Maybe there's a two-stage thing to it, some inciting mysteries/puzzles or whatever to get them (hopefully) interested, and then a reveal of the game nature and instructions for how to participate.</li>\n<li>Related to the above, I don't want any puzzles to be especially difficult or require special skills (tho my friends do have a few special skills, hmm, maybe I should rethink this?). Especially since there will only be probably 4-8 players (besides the +2 running it). I don't want to generate a ton of long-form story content (writing, videos, whatever), bits and pieces should be snappy, evocative, and relevant. And I don't need to bother with any complicated means to obscure my own involvement. </li>\n<li>Also, while I'm willing to put in some work, my budget for this is, if not quiet non-existent, pretty close. I am a poor person.</li> </ul>\nContent-wise: I'm thinking something ghost story-ish would appeal to the sensibilities of most of my friends. I know a bit of local history and doing more research (even tying in stuff from local museums or libraries) could be very cool. Plus that could be a way to point to additional research/study that people could do if they really get into it, while keeping the amount of content I have to generate/needed to play the game low. There are also a few abandoned communities/ghost towns within an hour and a half of where I live, not to mention abundant locations with natural beauty to stage investigations/adventures. But I haven't thought very deeply about any of that yet.<br/><br/><b>Things that I've thought of that might be cool (or necessary) to do:</b>\n<ul><li>Create one or more fake internet personas investigating some mystery, using that to reach out to players and/or guide them to a central site for discussing the game/clues/generating their own content.</li>\n<li>Mysterious letters via snail mail. Notes/flash drives/items/whatever. Flyers posted in places where my friends would see them (possibly using recurring designs/symbols to hopefully draw their attention).</li>\n<li>Using QR codes/Tine to lead them to video/audio clues online.</li>\n<li>Geocaching adventures/seeding locations with stuff.</li>\n<li>Enlisting friends-of-friends/family in other places as actors.</li>\n<li>Hiding stuff in their houses/cars. (While I'm there legitimately, of course, no breaking and entering. Obviously even this could be bad if not handled carefully and with the right people. I genuinely think my friends would have a blast with this whole thing, but I'm aware for a lot of people this would be verging on creepy/invasive. I'm definitely gonna try to be sensitive to possible misinterpretations of whatever I do, which is one of the reasons I am involving a partner who is mutually friends with everyone: to do sort of a double-check on "Might this be perceived as threatening or scary?")</li></ul>\n<b>Things I'm not sure about:</b>\n<ul><li>What kind of starting incident could work to hook people in? That they either won't ignore, or be unduly unnerved by? Or is the potential immersive quality of the mystery element just not worth the potential for things to go wrong in one direction or the other?</li>\n<li>How to make the story a collaborative process and invite creative contributions by the gang? Obviously with a central place for discussions I could just monitor and use their speculations as a prompt. Or I could build a hidden Apocalypse-World-via-Doomed-Pilgrim-style trigger framework: if they start doing/saying this, then this kind of thing happens. Or I can apply this fictional pressure. Or this or that could happen if I roll a 7-9 on 2d6, even. Or I could do a complete reveal of the game-nature of the game and sort of build a quasi-De Profundis on top of the thing.</li>\n<li>What sort of puzzles should/can I integrate?</li>\n<li>What are things that could go wrong that I'm not anticipating? What are some cool things that can be done in a game of this kind that I haven't imagined?</li></ul>\nAny and all thoughts/criticisms welcome. Also, pointers to relevant resources on ARG design, if you happen to have any. This weekend, assuming I don't talk myself out of this (or you don't), I'm gonna try to do some research and see if any good ideas for stories/mysteries/fictional content come to me. I'll post about that and anything else that gets discussed/occurs to me on Monday.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Starblazie" title="Starblazie"><img alt="Starblazie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Starblazie">Starblazie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449938/#Comment_449938" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-09T02:27:41+00:00" title="December  9, 2015  2:27AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should really check out the unfiction forums since ARGs are a big focus over there.  I'm including the link to the puppetmaster thread since I think that's where you would want to be and some other relevant links as well. <br/><a href="How to Create an Effective ARG" rel="nofollow">How to Create an Effective ARG</a><br/>(This one came from a friend who has played them in the past and she used this guide to actually create and run one as a Puppetmaster.)<br/><a href="http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/index.php?f=8" rel="nofollow">Puppet Master Help</a><br/><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/avantgame/make-an-alternate-reality-game" rel="nofollow">Jane McGonigal's Tips</a><br/>She's going to send me the opening email she used, so when I get it, I'll post it here too.  I've not had much experience with them, I always seem to miss the good ones, but that does sound like great fun to try!

I suggest taking a look at De Profundis if you want a freeform collaboration framework to develop into a LARP (which is sort of what you're describing)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
