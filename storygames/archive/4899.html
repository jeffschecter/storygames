I want to incorporate story design elements and some other goodness.  I will make the final draft available to anyone interested when finished but right now I need some help with Stats/Traits.<br/><br/>My current list is as follows.  <br/><br/>Traits:  <br/><b>Combat </b><br/>o  Strength (Brute force and Hand to hand attacks)<br/>o  Endurance (Wearing your opponent down and Recovery)<br/>o  Weapons (Attacking or defending with a Weapon)<br/>o  Speed (Movement and Initiative)<br/><br/><b>Warfare </b><br/>o  Organize (Get your forces ready)<br/>o  Tactics/Strategy (Deploy your forces intellegently)<br/>o  Perception (See the dangers/opportunities around you)<br/>o  Presence (Convince others to follow you)<br/><br/><b>Influence </b><br/>o  Position (Your position in court, etc)<br/>o  Maneuver (Use social scene to get what you want)<br/>o  Awareness (See the dangers/opportunities around you)<br/>o  Charisma (Convince others to follow you)<br/><br/><b>Power </b><br/>o  Chaos (Destruction/Attack) <br/>o  Art (Creation/Enhancement) <br/>o  Metamorphosis (Change/Obscure) <br/>o  Form (Stasis/Defense) <br/><br/>These four primary traits Combat, Warfare, Influence and Power cover the main areas of character conflict in my game.

That is, what is it about this that doesn't match your goals right now?<br/><br/>My own personal bias with systems like this is that it if all of the subattributes are independent of each other, then you can end up with what to me are very implausible characters. So here, for instance, you could have someone who is great at deploying his forces in battle, but lousy at seeing the place where his troops could get ambushed. That seems odd to me. I find that overlapping subattributes like this often come about out of a desire for symmetry, so each stat breaks down into four substats just because that way they're balanced, not because there are really four logical separate substat areas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109878/#Comment_109878" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T12:51:36+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 12:51PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're going from Amber to 16 attributes?

Althought the game is good there are times when it is difficult to determine reasonable conflict resolution.  Also characters may be very different but the rules don't enforce or reward this sort of differenitiation directly.  Last I really like the games I'm into now (SOTC, PDQ, Mortal Coil, TSoY, ect) and I'd like to find a way to add their coolness to my favorite game.<br/><br/>Design Goals?<br/>1.  I would like to see meaningful conflict in each of the main Trait areas (Combat, Warfare, Influence and Power).  <br/>2.  I would like to have characters with varied approaches to conflict within each area and the rules to reward creative use of niche subTraits.  <br/>3.  I would like each subTrait to be "cool" to have as the best (ie. each person's niche is fun to play and powerful in its own area).<br/>4.  I would like to retain the diceless character of the game (with one small addition of risk) - more on this after I've cleaned up the Traits issue<br/>5.  I would like to add some story driven elements that reward players for delineating and playing interesting stories (I want every player to feel like they are the main character in a Zelazney Amber novel) - more on this after I've cleaned up the Traits issue<br/>6.  I would like to have a single resolution mechanic that feeds advantages from nonTrait abilities (Pattern, Items, Allies, Shadow Resource, Passions, etc) into the Trait resolution system so play is minimally slowed by the mechanics. - more on this after I've cleaned up the Traits issue<br/>7.  There are probably others I'm missing or forgetting.

I think the semantic problem lies with <b>Warfare</b>. This compounded by <b>Warfare</b> leadership stepping on the <b>Influence</b> niche leadership. There have been great generals who cannot deal with politics. So I'm sure you want to separate <b>Influence</b> out.<br/><br/>In your system, it seems Warfare is really <b>Vision</b>.

If not you, have to resolve the conflict be it fighting, maneuvering, secrets, or social games.  I just want to create a method that reinforces the story and character/protagonist feel of the game.  The current game is really good (I've run and played it successfully for years).  I just wonder if it could be better without losing some of the feel of Erick's original game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110397/#Comment_110397" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:33:46+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:33PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arref</cite><br/><br/>For instance, your players may have a problem with 'Combat' and 'Warfare' being separate.

Thanks for helping out. My players do not have a problem dividing Combat and Warfare from one another.  I do agree the overlap between "Warfare" and "Influence" is real but somehow I want to keep each Trait to a specific field of conflict.  I'm realistic that this will be a little artificial (all games are if you push them hard enough).  I like your refinement.  What I need is way for each Trait to control a specific area of conflict.  <br/><br/>My players will be fighting (combat), leading and participating in war (warfare/vision), maneuvering in court/social games (Influence) and controlling/utilizing powers like Pattern (power).  For my system to work I've got to get a buy in that one trait controls each area of conflict.  Other traits and subtraits will influence the resolution but one trait needs to be primary.

You've defined four things that people can do in your game, so you're assigning one attribute to each thing. That's pretty clean. If based on your experience running with this group of people you're pretty sure that these are the only four things that people will ever want to do, then your problems are solved. <br/><br/>The only thing you have to worry about is if someone tries to do something that isn't one of those four things. (Note that the original Amber game has this problem to an extent as well.) If two people play chess, do you use Warfare? And if so, does that make Benedict the best chess player in the universe? What if someone wants to have a horse race, or steer a ship through a storm, or sneak around the Castle, or...<br/><br/>But you don't have to deal with questions like that if you don't want to. It's perfectly valid to spotlight four types of conflict and then say that the genre assumption is that other sorts of conflict just don't matter, and can be resolved by fiat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110443/#Comment_110443" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T14:44:02+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  2:44PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more random thought:<br/><br/>What if you stuck with your four main attributes (Warfare, Combat, Influence, Power), but you let players pick their own customized subattributes.
