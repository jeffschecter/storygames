It's my second game, after the recent <a href="http://machineageproductions.com/?page_id=143" rel="nofollow">Maschine Zeit</a>. I\u2019m going to share what the game is about in the loosest sense, and a bit about the way the game engine runs. Amaranthine is a game about relationships.<br/><br/>Amaranthine is about people that, for whatever reason, reincarnate. From a certain point in their histories, these characters are reborn every time they die, until the end of time. Amaranthine is a game about the relationships you build and rebuild, as in their repeated lives, there are no coincidences. If you meet someone in this life, you\u2019ve probably met them before. In fact, when you meet them, you have a glimpse of your shared past history. In a game sense, your game traits give you a certain amount of jurisdiction in improvising that history with the player of the other character.<br/><br/>That\u2019s the micro end. On the macro end, Amaranthine tend to draw followers. Without even trying, they stumble across sycophants, they command small armies. They can\u2019t help but to find themselves in places where groups of people do their bidding.<br/><br/>Each of these two sides of Amaranthine have a unique method of tracking. The macro end uses a chess board (more on that, later.) The micro end uses relationship wheels. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about today. The relationship wheel is tied to the game\u2019s core mechanic, which is all about escalating conflicts. If you really want to succeed at something that\u2019s integral to plot, you escalate up to three times. Each time you escalate, you make bad things happen later. Consider it karma. If you knock your lover out of the way of the speeding car, and have to escalate, to push fate a little further than it wants to go, bad things happen later. For instance, your nemesis might be at the hospital when you arrive at the ER to deliver your friend. When you escalate conflicts, you have Plot Points (official name pending,) that allow you a greater chance of success.<br/><br/><a href="http://machineiv.webs.com/intensity.jpg" rel="nofollow">This is a rough sketch</a> of the way I envision the relationship wheel. It\u2019s a clockwise dial that you move around as gameplay progresses. You get one of these for every Micro-level character. Every villain, every PC, every et cetera. They start on either the Stranger + or Stranger \u2013 spot. You have an Intensity score with the relationship, that score will likely range from 0-3.<br/><br/>Any time you escalate a conflict against that character, with that character, or for that character, you move along the relationship wheel. You move a number of spaces equal to your Intensity plus one die for every step you escalated the conflict. There are two \u2018neutral zones\u2019 along the wheel. There\u2019s a \u2018hot\u2019 zone, and a \u2018cold\u2019 zone. The hot and cold zone influences a few traits. For example, if the wheel is for a lover, the hot zone might offer bonuses when trying to influence them. The cold zone might offer bonuses to resist a strong emotional response when they\u2019re in danger. With a nemesis, the hot zone might offer a bonus to all-out, guttural attacks against them. The cold might offer bonuses to attacking their sycophants to indirectly harm them. Those bonuses are mostly universal. The game assumes that enemies and lovers aren\u2019t a hard line. Fucking a nemesis is absolutely something that happens amongst the Amaranthine. Why? Well, it\u2019s dramatically appropriate. Also, you\u2019ve probably both been enemies and lovers in a past life. Most importantly, when your (karma) points come back to bite you in the ass, the hot and cold zones affect the nature of the bite. A nemesis might get an edge. A friend might end up in trouble. The whole goal here is to simulate the ebb and flow of a relationship. Depending on its intensity, that might happen slowly or rapidly. You might be that couple that\u2019s constantly fucking and fighting. You might have a lull. Amaranthine leans toward the former, more than the latter.<br/><br/>Every time the wheel gets completely spun around, you get a Plot Point. These are the points used to be more successful in escalations. Since every time you escalate a conflict with someone, you effectively put them in danger, the game actually rewards you for stretching relationships thin. If you want Plot Points, you have to have fiery, intense relationships. When those relationships are put into risk, you need Plot Points to protect them. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Also, I haven\u2019t worked it out, but I think there\u2019s going to be a minor flowchart system for relationship evolution as the wheel is completed.<br/><br/>Think about Spiderman, in the dramatic sense. When he stretches his relationship with Mary Jane thin, he brings her back into the fold by saving her from falling off a building. He does something epic and dramatic to return the relationship to a sense of normalcy. That epic and dramatic thing puts her in danger. That\u2019s Amaranthine. Amaranthine is full of rooftop swordfights, high-speed chases and leaps over canyons. Why? Because you love or hate someone so much, it drives you to do these things. Amaranthine isn\u2019t about resolving conflicts, it\u2019s about exploring them, creating them, fostering them, then watching them explode.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291244/#Comment_291244" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T15:31:15+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  3:31PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds potentially fascinating!
