Each success or failure has definite consequences and once you've hit the success/failure count, the task is considered resolved.<br/><br/>I also wrote a short article, <a href="http://zakarntson.livejournal.com/29413.html" rel="nofollow">[D&amp;D] Injecting Story</a>, which provides an admittedly weak example of this.<br/><br/>As for combats, I can imagine it as a Skill Challenge where you are assumed to survive, only each failure causes you to expend a Daily Power, lose a Healing Surge, or lose 1/4 of your HP (for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150419/#Comment_150419" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T07:59:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  7:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak, the goal with skill challenges isn't so that you can have 5 (or sometimes as many as 12) rolls just to get to a binary.  But so that every player has a chance to roll and participate in the Challenge and contribute to its success.  If it were just a single roll pass/fail, then one player would get to do it and everyone else would be relegated to audience.  Making sure every player and every character build has something to contribute to every conflict is one of the core 4E design principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've thought about other ways to accomplish this but I don't think any of them work as well.  For instance you could just have one person make the main roll and everyone else make Aiding rolls.  But that makes one character clearly the feature, and turns success into a linear curve again.  The multiple rolls to get success / failure, essentially turn skill challenges into a die pool (and all the benefits to bell curve distribution that brings) where the dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once...which is exactly how D&amp;D; combat works, so it brings another level of consistency to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nProviding specific consequences to each step of failure is totally legitimate and suggested in the rules (with examples).  They also talk about specific side benefits to individual steps of victory (gaining a bonus to a future roll, making a connection to a useful NPC or finding a side treasure I think are the examples they give of this).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150422/#Comment_150422" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T08:04:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  8:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only played in one Skill Challenge so far but I'm thinking that I'll play through a few dozen or so before I start tinkering too too much.<br><br>It is an interesting mechanic and some hacking is called for but I'm just not able to get a total grip on its table truth just yet.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150451/#Comment_150451" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T09:35:06+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak - I would also question, because that I don't feel Skill Challenges as presented are that binary. For sheer "yes/no", in the end - they may be... but doesn't any role-playing or other rule challenge come down to an answer that needs to be yes/no in some fashion?<br><br>My reading/understanding of Skill Challenges (which I have not used in-game yet, but am VERY keen on trying it and understanding it more)  is that they are a series of role-play and player/DM scene developers that build up multiple Skill CHECKS, culminating in the Skill Challenge targets.  So while the outcome will be determined, the process of getting to that outcome seems to me like it could/should/would be very very interesting from a rules and role-play challenge.<br/><br/>I got the feeling like this could benefit the game with a three-prong attack of "drama".  <br/>-  One dramatic push working on the role-play aspect.  <br/>-  One working on the player-to-DM dialogue<br/>-  and one using the rules of multiple die rolls<br/><br/>All adding and driving toward the rising action of the drama in the scene in their individually unique directions.<br/><br/><br/>Me... I'll be looking to create at least one Skill Challenge for my first (campaign) game for 4e tomorrow...  I'm keenly interested in digging into the meat of game philosophy of the Skill Challenge rule  not to mention  developing an understanding of how to put together Skill Challenges on-the-fly if/when needed.<br/><br/><br/>I would KILL for any other detailed comments, theory and/or example ideas for Skill Challenges.  Anyone have any thought/advice, either brand new or comments from my points?<br/>Anyone know of any links to other discussions on this or other forums regarding them?

You know what skills worked and didn't worked who used what skill what order those skills where used in and what people thought of those skills. Alot of this is junked in the ultimate expression (pass/fail or the statistical 7% chance of success) but theirs a lot of story stuff in there that you would not get otherwise. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can use skill challenges for more or less anything that is not resolved in one or two rolls or with combat. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last one I did , in a sandboxy colonial game, is that the players were attempting to find a place to start their settlement.  with a little handguiding i managed to get a one or two sentence discription of each skill check which ends with someone mentioning box canyons and aquafers and passing as the last success needed. They found a box canyon and the aquafer... good times. <br/>\n<br/>\nThinks like investigate these disappearences, find the lost cavern of tscumbeth, scale this mountain, prepare this ambush, win over this tribe of natives, create a trade treaty, meet the duke, I think would make all good skill challenges. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for on the fly skill challenges, I spell out what happens if they win, what happens if they loose, how many success and failures are needed before either happens, and the base DC of the checks.  I think its really good especialyl for dnd because it helps prevent some of the badwrong dming, (secrecy, surprises, narrowly definied win althought that can still exist) and gives the players a way to riff or noodle off each other. The players start filling in the details (even something as narrow as my rogue makes a hide check is an addittional bit of info for the other players, why is the rogue making a hide check, where are they hiding,  etc etc) for themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice, I would probably use simpler(reversed maybe better way of saying) numbers for pass/fail then in the book .  (for the first few levels (15 or so) 4p6f, 6p8f, 8p,10f, and so on for complexity 1,2,3 and so on challenges provide something like 70-80% percent chance of success at the appropiate dc's. and has increased complexity challenges actually give less chance of success, which is not the case in the raw at this point, someone on enworld also wrote a script that will give you the percent pass of success considering the dc, skill modifier and the number of pass/fails needed, which i found helpful in this regard. also lets you reward creative actions with +2's and the opposite, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMybiggest word of advice for skill challenges , ignore the autofail option, maybe assign a -2 but run with that "say yes" stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a lot longer then i expected, hope that is helpful                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150474/#Comment_150474" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T10:12:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 10:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logos, you have a link to where they're doing the math on that?

It's better to think of individual skill checks inside a challenge like individual Raises/Sees in Dogs In The Vineyard - each one moves toward the resolution of the conflict, yes, but each one ALSO changes the fiction in meaningful ways. All the best "content" is inside the challenge, not in the result. Indeed, I think part of the frustration with the excessively steep difficulty for Skill Challenges is that it discourages using them for anything where overall success or failure actually matters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150478/#Comment_150478" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T10:21:18+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 10:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, skill challenges aren't meant to be like combat, where winning is good and losing is very bad and painful. Skill challenges should have interesting loss scenarios. <br/><br/>I think of skill challenges as being like the Fellowship's attempt to cross the Misty Mountains in LotR. The price of failure is taking a different, darker route. Boromir and Aragon use athletics to try and clear a path, Legolas uses his Fey Step ability to assist, Gandalf uses magic, Gimli makes endurance rolls (the Hobbits are clearly NPCs in 4th edition, so I'll leave them out).<br/><br/>Another example might be the boulder scene in Raiders of the Lost Arc, as Indy avoids various traps on his way out of the temple.<br/><br/>There's a lot of potential there, but I think it's going to take actualy play to find the best ways to use skill challenges. The DMG gives some interesting examples, like trying to convince the Baron to help you, or having PCs try to disarm a trap while carrying on a fight with monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150487/#Comment_150487" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T10:46:28+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 10:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Valamir:</b> I must admit that I didn't see those examples. D'oh! Thank you for posting that. I do understand that the point of a Skill Challenge is to get everyone involved, which I greatly admire. It's the idea of spending all those rolls in order to achieve a "do you convince the Duke or not" style result that I'm worried about.<br/><br/>I think my hang up was using <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080505a" rel="nofollow">the Wizards preview example</a> and the keywords, <b>success</b> and <b>failure</b>, written in the Skill Challenge description. The skill checks in that example don't provide anything other than an opportunity to roleplay towards a single decision point: Getting the NPC's assistance or not. I'd prefer to see most (if not all) examples provide a spectrum of results: Sure you succeed in getting help, but you got one failure and tried to intimidate the Duke, so he's sending his useless son and a retinue of hardened criminals. Keeping those guys in line will likely require further Skill Challenges between (or even during) encounters.<br/><br/>A few days after I'd written my article, I did get a chance to skim the other examples in the DMG. I missed the effects of successes and failures; I was likely frontloading my bias rather than reading things in detail. My books should arrive tonight, so I'll be eagerly devouring them this weekend.<br/><br/>Also consider that I'd like to see Skill Challenges <i>and</i> combat allow the party to create the story themselves rather than move along a preset decision tree, as it seems to be presented in Keep of the Shadowfell.

It's better to think of individual skill checks inside a challenge like individual Raises/Sees in Dogs In The Vineyard - each one moves toward the resolution of the conflict, yes, but each one ALSO changes the fiction in meaningful ways. All the best "content" is inside the challenge, not in the result. Indeed, I think part of the frustration with the excessively steep difficulty for Skill Challenges is that it discourages using them for anything where overall success or failure actually matters.</blockquote>\nHm, then maybe a different solution to the skill challenge problem is not to change the math, but to reward XP regardless of success or failure.  Currently the DMG says (p. 76):\n<blockquote>The consequences of total defeat are often obvious: no XP and no treasure.</blockquote>\nIf XP were always rewarded, players would not consider it a downside to risk defeat.  And DMs could expand story options due to failure (of course, this fits a story-gamish approach better than the more traditional railroad).<br/><br/>Steven                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150685/#Comment_150685" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T21:15:37+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            here is one of the threads about the relative chance of success on a skill challenge, it cribs a bit of the original method used but I think it shows the problem per say<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?t=230357<br/>\n<br/>\nyou have a sucess rate , that if all the presumptions are correct is about 7% for the first 10 levels except for the occassional 14 as the introduction of stat boosts or skill boosters enter things. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt then varies between 7 and 24 percent for a while until reaching what i kind of expect in the last 3 or 4 levels or so. <br/>\n<br/>\nalso one of the odd implications is that longer skill challenges (increased complexity as definied in the book) are actually easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely think a little something has to be done with it, if it plays the way the rules say, and i see no reason why it shouldn't. I'm using alternative numbers for the pass/fail thing and not messing with the dc's or overall results. Some people are lowering the dc's by 5 (which produces success rates in the 60's but still has the supposedly more complex things being easier) some people have some really crazy system of doing it. And then their is always the above options, failures as obstacles as apposed to failures, but that doesn't set so well with me because I'm like well why isn't the dm expanding story options to begin with as apposed to when the party fails. (failing aslo sucks in and of itself, and i think that's part of the reason why it ought to be addressed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
