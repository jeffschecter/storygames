And of course they have CCGs and such.<br/>And they recently started carrying graphic novels, taking advantage of all the shelves they've looted from a Borders bookstore that closed down nearby.<br/><br/>And then there's the RPGs. They have the expected selection of competing D&amp;D4E and Pathfinder, GURPS, Warhammer, and all the other mainstream standards like Savage Worlds and Call of Cthulhu. The main thing, though, is that they are increasingly catering to indie and similar games. Gumshoe, Burning Wheel, Don't Rest Your Head, Fiasco, Happy Birthday Robot, Kobolds Ate My Baby, Hell 4 Leather, Poison'd, etc. It has, in my opinion, the widest selection of indie games of any Portland-area game store that I have personally been to (and there's only two other game stores I haven't been to, yet).<br/><br/>They also have a good area in back with tables for people to play games, though it is usually taken up with miniature gamers, Magic the Gathering, or D&amp;D Encounters. We try to hold GoPlay PDX West events here, though typically only Chris Goodwin and myself actually show up lately.

It can't quite compare to Endgame in terms of the quality of events it hosts (there have been some Story Game Days there, but nothing on the level of Endgame's minicons), but it's a big, brightly-lit store with an excellent selection of basically every kind of tabletop game, including independent RPGs. They have a big gaming space that hosts tons of CCG, war game, and D&amp;D stuff, and they periodically have flea markets to boot. The staff is friendly and they really know their stuff.<br/><br/>The owner Ray is one of the few FLGS owners who contacted us directly about ordering Maid RPG, and in fact I'm going to be stopping by there to drop copies off yet again fairly soon. I get the impression he puts comparable effort into finding other independently done products to sell, which is really cool IMO.

If the stuff sells they'll keep stocking it. If it doesn't sell, then at least they've given it a shot. They're more of a miniatures store in general, with a side focus in Magic and other card games, but they're interested in expanding their roleplaying stuff. I know the owner and I've had a few good chats with him. I'm sure I could run a regular indie gaming day in his store if I had the time.<br/><br/>We've got a growing franchise in the form of <a href="http://goodgames.com.au/" rel="nofollow">"Good Games"</a>, who claim on their website that they give <a href="http://goodgames.com.au/other_opportunities" rel="nofollow">game designers and others interesting in gaming a step-up into the market</a>e...but my attempts to cotact them have been left with no response. They seem great when it comes to D&amp;D/Pathfinder, but ignorant of anything indie. <br/><br/>Then there is the biggest game store in Sydney, probably in terms of sales anyway...<a href="http://www.gamesparadise.com.au/" rel="nofollow">"Games Paradise"</a>. They have a great range of indie stuff, probably all from IPR. They have been quoted on numerous occasions that there are no games produced in Australia, sometimes followed up by the claim that no-one would wan to buy them anyway. This is a common laughing point among the Aussie design community (most of whom buy directly from overseas authors to avoid the incredible mark-up that Games Paradise puts on their products. The service in this store is another common point of humour among the local game community, most people do their research online and if they need to physically see a copy of a book before buying it, they'll go in to "Games Parasites" on a quick scouting foray to peruse the hardcopy before going home and buying it online for 25-50% less.<br/><br/>There are a few other stores in Sydney, but they are in other parts of the city and I'm not as familiar with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356158/#Comment_356158" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T20:25:39+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  8:25PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Canadian choice: <a href="http://levalet.com/" rel="nofollow">Le Valet d'Coeur</a> is an astounding of story-game friendly store in Montreal.

It's the spiritual successor to a long-lived store (Game Castle) that I used to patronize as a kid, and that finally closed its doors a few years ago. DiceHouse isn't huge, or a Mecca of indie games, but it does have a great community atmosphere, a buyer rewards program (5% of all purchases goes toward your store credit), a 20% discount on custom orders (and oftentimes, if I talk up a new small-press release and order it through them, they'll order another couple copies and put 'em on the shelf), a friendly, knowledgeable staff (of one, currently), a good selection of used games for cheap, and frequent in-store events. If you're in or near Fullerton, it's well worth checking out.<br/><br/>There's also The Realm up in Brea, which seems nice and all, but the only time I've gone there was for Free RPG Day, so I really couldn't say more than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356166/#Comment_356166" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T22:36:45+00:00" title="January 26, 2012 10:36PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2012 10:38PM by Mcdaldno.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Seattle, there's this amazing place. It's called <a href="http://www.cardkingdom.com/" rel="nofollow">Card Kingdom</a>.<br/><br/>Card Kingdom has a really big board game room, a mid-sized trad RPG room, a mid-sized CCG room, a puzzles &amp; family games room, a large ccg-duelling room...<br/>...and then the really cool stuff: two beautiful private gaming rooms and an in-store gaming bar.<br/><br/>The gaming bar, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CafeMox" rel="nofollow">Cafe Mox</a>, is (A) the most beautiful bar I have ever been in, possibly, and (B) designed from the ground up to host games and gamers. There is a long wooden table, perfect for a couple Magic: the Gathering duels. There are a few booths with high-backed padded seats, and draw curtains, comfy and secluded for a roleplaying game or longer board game. The tops of those seats feature beautiful, hand-painted murals. And then there are a couple more booths, perfect for grabbing a quick game of some sort. They have a couple good beers on tap, some simple-but-tasty meals, and lovely staff. And since it's right inside the Card Kingdom store, you're allowed to check out a board game from their extensive board game library, for free, and then take it into the bar and play it while having a pint of something delicious.<br/><br/>Cafe Mox is beautiful. You can have a drink while hearing the clatter of dice and smelling delicious soup being carried across the cafe. You can play a round of Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer while eating a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich. <br/><br/><br/>Card Kingdom sadly doesn't stock indie games, beyond the Burning Wheel line-up, that I could see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356167/#Comment_356167" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T22:40:38+00:00" title="January 26, 2012 10:40PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe took all my answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356180/#Comment_356180" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T23:45:30+00:00" title="January 26, 2012 11:45PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If any of you are ever stuck in the middle of Massachusetts, we do our best to carry a nice selection of Story Games at my shop <a href="http://www.modern-myths.com" rel="nofollow">Modern Myths</a>.<br/><br/>It helps that we have a ridiculous wealth of riches in terms of game designers in the general area, most of whom are cool enough to sell us some copies of their games to have on the shelf.
