But it sure would be great. This goes back to the <em>two way</em> interaction of fiction with rules that seem so elusive right now.</p>\n<p>Let's look at <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=22" rel="nofollow">what Vincent said about Immersion</a> an astonishing 4 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>[1] The affirmed rightness of your vision</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is social. Your fellow players share ownership of your character, remember; you want and need for them to affirm that your vision of your character is right. They trust you with your character.

You can't be worrying whether this decision that your character's making might break the game. You have to know, securely enough that it's unconscious, that even if your character transforms the game entirely, the game'll survive.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Charles proposes a fourth:</p>\n<p><em>I would add an additional underpinning, which is [4] the degree to which the mechanic requires a state of mind which is similar to the PC state of mind. If my PC is trying to be totally open and honest with another character, and the mechanics for doing so pit us as players against each other in a competitive bidding war where one of us will lose and one of us will win, then that would seem to create a conflict between what I am experiencing as player, and what I am experiencing IC, and that may act to the detriment either of my ability to effectively use the rules, or to effectively remain immersed in my character, or both. If the mechanics instead involved us as players working together against abstract difficulty, then that might better mirror the IC situation, and better allow us to remain immersed.</em></p>\n<p>I think that a game design that fulfilled these design goals would create extremely intense, profound play. Furthermore, I think that as a design challenge it's an excellent one: difficult but not impossible, at the frontier of theory, compelling and immediate, practically guaranteed to make a successful game.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>As usual, this is a matter of properly matching specifications and system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206565/#Comment_206565" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T11:39:46+00:00" title="May 10, 2009 11:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you that to some degree A is under-served right now. Which is odd because I know a LOT of players who play primarily in that mode - virtually all the play-by-forum RPers who base their games on a commercial property, for example, and they outnumber everyone in the whole hobby by an order of magnitude at least.  <br/><br/>Indeed, I myself sometimes play in that mode when I want to blow off steam/relax/just hang out and play casually.  I think the main problem of A is that there's little conflict that is satisfying - if nothing gets in your way, the game is boring, if something gets in your way, you'd rather it hadn't.  I think you could make a less-conflictual challenge that might satisfy A-based players, if there was some Big Thing their character wanted that they needed to team up with others and work together to get, that might scratch the itch without putting a ton of stuff in the fiction that's only there to make the players less happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206570/#Comment_206570" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T13:10:51+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  1:10PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2009 1:11PM by Emily_Care.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great quote and great things, Joshua. They are also very politely worded as being about "the other players" but what they are pointing at is a serious commitment from each of us to take deeply to heart the rights of others to do as they will, and to accept what happens to our character even if we do love them from the bottom of our little heart. <br/><br/>Let's talk about how we might get them. Or what happens when we don't.\n<blockquote>[1] The affirmed rightness of your vision<br/>This is social. Your fellow players share ownership of your character, remember; you want and need for them to affirm that your vision of your character is right. They trust you with your character. <b>They won't step in and contradict, override, undercut.</b></blockquote>\nEmphasis mine. That seems like the heart of it. What are the ways that people can and do step in, contradict and override? There are games (now) that support this mechanically. The High Card narration rights in Primetime Adventures can be used to do anything you with another players's character.  It takes trust and shared vision for that to play out right. I've experienced that in my games, but it's a structural way for a person's trust, and their bond with/vision for their character to be broken. <br/><br/>Let's also look at ways this can happen <b>outside</b> of mechanics, because that surely is often done, and may be more important.  We rely on the other players to mirror, to support and to enable us to play our characters the way we will. In a game with a standard social contract (oh forgive me for that, but here goes) [players control: character actions/feelings/reactions--GM controls: world/environment/NPCs]  even if you play your character in a given way, the other players and the GM have a tremendous amount of power to undermine your vision. <br/><br/>example:<br/>Player A: <i>Jedediah brings back the lost mustang, snorting and bucking, But he handles the rope with calm and muscles the horse into submission.</i><br/>Player B: <i>Jedediah! You poor little thing, that monster's going to kill you! Here, I'll help! Frank throws another rope around the mustang's neck, and nudges Jedediah out of the way.</i><br/>GM:<i>The mustang is snorting and a red light gleams in it's eye. You thought you had it handled, but it was just bluffing and now redoubles its efforts, aiming a well-placed kick at your eye.</i> <br/><br/>This might be helped by:\n<blockquote>[2] Permission to act with passion<br/>Furthermore, whatever you have your character do, they won't react defensively. If your character threatens something they value, they'll deal with the threat passionately in response, but without ever carrying the struggle up into the social level.<br/><br/>You aren't constrained by the fear that having your character act might step on someone else's toes.</blockquote>\nIn the above example, there might be all kinds of reasons why the other players did that to Player A. Player B might have been angling for the roughneck position in the party for their character for sessions. Having Jedediah who was, say, the gunslinger, suddenly also bring in the mighty Mustang means not only does Frank get overshadowed in gunfights, but is also being outshone in his own (as defined by the player) arena, horsemanship.  <br/><br/>The GM may be pissed off because Player A brought in the mustang ahead of schedule.  They were supposed to go out and search it out as a group later. Now that is tricky stuff there. We get into territory where the GM has a story that the players get to participate in. <br/><br/>Whether that is passively and whether that is satisfying is a whole nother argument. I've been writing recently about Danish scenario play where the GM not only tells a story (as written by the game writer), but that players really literally are along for the ride.  But how they flesh out what happens it all their own. It is another, different social contract [players control: character actions/feelings/reactions--GM controls: world/environment/npcs--game writer controls: outline of events of play]. It's not too different from module play, except that what you do while playing is almost entirely different. The emphasis is on the moments, the reactions, the interactions, not the outcomes of conflicts and rolls. It is much more like Type B play than Type A. <br/><br/>So how do we get around these blocks? In adventure play (a la D&amp;D), having well-defined character niches, as they do in 4e with the roles (striker, controller etc) functions to minimized conflicts like the one I outlined with Player B here. Danish scenario play takes the "you can't do that yet" "yes I can!" argument out of the GMs hands, since everyone knows that the story will unfold as the game dictates. Everyone is (hopefully) on board to flesh out that fun and to trust that the GM chose a good one. In some games, if you fail, you get to say what and how your character goes down in a blaze of glory, that's another way to foster trust so that if you get hosed it doesn't feel so bad. No on did it <b>to</b> you, you chose it and that's all good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206571/#Comment_206571" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T13:11:42+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  1:11PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the fact that you like a character, and choose well for them is in contradiction with all of these things.

His awareness of other players and his insight in "the demands of the fiction" (as constantly defined and redefined by the group) is clearly lacking. There is little help to get for such players ... A GM wise enough to see through their misunderstanding, may give them constructive feedback there and then, but ordinarily the reactions to such behavior will kill some (or all) of the joy in the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Thomas was trying to say something<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9296" rel="nofollow">over there</a> and things got derailed in a stupid internet way.</blockquote>I did not <i>feel </i>derailed. It just flowed in different directions simultaneously. Fine with me.<br/><br/>This thread is nice too. :-)<br/><br/>I'd like to comment on the variations A and B given by Joshua:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>A: So, let's say that we have a game in which you are to identify strongly with the character you're playing. When the character is sad, you're sad. When the character is happy, you're happy. You want this character to have a good life for the same reasons you want yourself to. You probably want this character to do things you wish you could do.</blockquote>Why do you want your character to have a good life? The normal way to work your character is to strengthen it, but why?<br/><br/>- Why do a great majority of players work for the betterment of their characters?<br/><br/>- Why do most game-smiths take this stance for granted in their games?<br/><br/>I believe we are prone to use our will to succeed in everything we do. This is natural, and express itself in a lot of ways. There are several arenas we strive to succeed in, the social one most prominent amongst them.<br/><br/>Player A is, in a distorted way, the most "true" man in this respect. He will engage in his character, and work for its betterment throughout the game. He is still a social incompetent in the example of Joshua, a disaster waiting to happen. The example describes a sympathetic player with no other strategy than to <i>identify </i>with his character. It is interesting to make such a "player", for the sake of argument, but we need to know that such a player is a theorem, not a reality.<br/><br/>That said; I like the idea that our player A is totally on the side with this character. He will fight claw and beak to make the character survive. As a starting point for character-play this is good. In a simple way it simulates the fact that all people strive to survive and succeed. All sentient beings do. By exploiting our natural tendency to do well, the game-smith may build a fictional environment which challenges us on the emotional level. By building on natural human reactions, the players and GMs will react in earnest and with ease as the characters. "With ease" is essential here; when players react and act with little or no hesitation, their emotional and intellectual energy is flowing into the game. As a result the role-playing game gains a smooth player ride into fictional flow. At best the interaction is driven and compelling, laden with positive emotional tension.<br/><br/>So the stance of this "player A" is, however distorted, at the hearth of successful role-playing games. We need to <i>identify with our characters</i> to make the instant and recurring "jump of faith" required for truly great interactive fiction.<br/><br/>(continues)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206626/#Comment_206626" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T23:55:09+00:00" title="May 10, 2009 11:55PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2009 5:46AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

It makes grand historical ideals of research and refinement come true in role-playing games ... or so it seems.<br/><br/>However; the interaction of role-playing games are of another kind than other fictions; you will create nothing of real value without engaging the players, as you need the players to identify with their characters, and to engage these characters in the fiction. If the friction between character and the fictional elements fails to engage the players, the game will produce fiction of shallow quality. Typical for such games are lack of emotional content, and lack of "enlivened" characters.<br/><br/>Games created with the intent to create "interesting characters", or worse; "interesting stories", is often lacking in emotional content. They often <i>feels </i>flat, however clever they are, and falls flat on the surface of fiction. Often they will be experienced as construed, and leave the players with a strange feeling of being outside the real drama. The most widely known example of this is <i>Vampire</i>, a game dedicated to creating and playing <i>"interesting characters with complex flaws that may be irredeemable"</i>. And a game where the said "flaws" seldom get any strongly felt consequences, due to the game being a bit clumsy on how to engage the feelings of the players. As a result Vampire often feels like "sex with the motions, but no emotions". There are more examples, amongst them some American indie-games with meta-mechanics that makes them more of an intellectual exercise in resource-handling than anything else.<br/><br/><i>(not trying to provoke here, only referring to how me and some of my friends have experienced <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> indie-games, not all)</i>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>I see a lot of functional play with variety B happening these days.Variety A, I dunno. But it sure would be great. This goes back to the<em>two way</em>interaction of fiction with rules that seem so elusive right now.</blockquote>Contrary to Joshua, I don't see much "functional play" with variety B happening. I do see some game-play of this kind, and it may be "functional" from the view of a creative agenda limited to creating tales of internal logic, but it seldom produce the kind of interaction that makes players gasp in happiness or sorrow over character fates.<br/><br/>I see the B-variation mostly as an intellectual exercise, Joshua. It may be cleverly staged, and may deliver play that is fun in new and interesting ways, but it will fail to deliver much drama of breathtaking quality.<br/><br/>So I'm with the A-variation, with the necessary adjustments for true interaction and player integrity; which is achieved by softening the <i>identification with character</i> with a sound dose of distance at certain points of the game-play (like in; talking on the meta-level, rolling the dice, considering the joy of other players, adhering to the demands of the fiction, pondering where this character will carry me, etc.).<br/><br/><i>Writing this has clarified a lot for me, so I give thanks to Joshua for setting up this thread.</i> :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206667/#Comment_206667" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T08:50:58+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  8:50AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope this isn't a deraily tangent, but this thread so far is reminding me quite a bit of that <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6035" rel="nofollow">[Sorcerer] The One Misunderstood Rule</a> thread that I started back about a year ago or so.

All it needs to be satisfying is a willingness to stick through the rough patches, and time for reflection.<br/>I completely agree.  As I noted in the other thread, the key with identification is simply the ability to distinguish between levels -- or put another way, the ability to drop into character and out again.  So in-character I may be really mad with the character Tulwyn for betraying me, but after the game, I can laugh and thank Steve for his portrayal of Tulwyn as a character that I love to hate.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Have you ever played with someone who's insufferable but uses the excuse 'because that's what my character would do'? That's what happens when you forget you're playing with other people.</blockquote>\nWell, this is a split issue.  The above has happened to me, but at least as often I've also played with a lot of people who refuse to distinguish between character and player.  That is, if the character does something bad, then they get angry with the player for being bad.  I think in particular of a Victorian Call of Cthulhu game where my character Grimmond was an abusive and violent police officer.  At one point, he became incensed with Professor Hayward (Jim's PC) and beat him senseless.  Now, Jim was fine with this, but another player Mark felt that this was completely wrong and got very angry with me as a player over this.  In my overall experience, I don't feel that the mixing of in-game and out-of-game is tied to close character identification.  Someone who is completely distant from their character, treating it like a pawn in the game, can still become angry in real-life for someone else messing with their character -- in the manner of, "Hey, you messed with my playing piece, you jerk!"  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>So I'm with the A-variation, with the necessary adjustments for true interaction and player integrity; which is achieved by softening the<i>identification with character</i>with a sound dose of distance at certain points of the game-play (like in; talking on the meta-level, rolling the dice, considering the joy of other players, adhering to the demands of the fiction, pondering where this character will carry me, etc.).</blockquote>\nWell, I disagree with some of the above about what is sound.  In particular, I am troubled by the third.  For many games, I may come to the table hoping for immersive, in-character play.  In this case, my enjoyment is served best by you sticking to and playing out your character.  If you distance yourself and frequently drop into meta-level talk, my enjoyment is lessened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206731/#Comment_206731" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T12:17:18+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 12:17PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The times I've seen character-identification play go screwy is when someone's vision gets wrecked.

For example, the game "13 at the Table" that I played recently with Emily at Knutepunkt.  Now, it's true that we did have meta-level talk to organize the game and arrange it, and discuss it afterwards.  However, it seems to me that it's a kind of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> to claim that this is opposed to the idea of sympathy with the character.  Yes, there always will and must be differences between the player and the character, nor will a player be in-character for his entire life.  <br/><br/>However, no I don't think that it is necessary or inherently improves a game to stop for die-rolls or other meta-level talking during the middle of play.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it isn't essential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206835/#Comment_206835" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T22:44:44+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 10:44PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2009 11:11PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, it is not essential to "stop for die rolls", but it is essential <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how you incorporate the action of rolling and interpreting</span>, if they are part of the game. In a dialogue-based rpg with a mechanical system part of the method, the inherent qualities and practical implementation of the given system is of great importance. The mechanics can hamper the game, or help it forward.<br/><br/>I am really claiming that the elements listed are opposed to "the totally sympathetic player" (given as "variation A" in this thread), as such a player will have little will and ability to consider them in a fruitful way. I'm argumenting the theorem, not the reality of it. In reality 100% sympathy does not exist in "dialogue-based rpgs" (tabletop rpgs), except possibly as a player gone mad with rpgs (which I have not heard of).<br/><br/>And I argue that our <i>sympathetic instincts</i> may be used to power the interaction, while the player is adhering to the special demands inherent in tabletop rpgs.<br/><br/>I played "13 at the table" some years ago, and it is a nice little game.

You started this discussion in the other thread by presenting "sympathy" and "empathy" as two approaches to play.  However, what you say here is that by definition, true sympathy would be insanity and that no one actually does it.  While I can see that definition as being consistent, it is confusing because at first sympathy seemed like a position held by real players that you were criticizing.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/>And I argue that our<i>sympathetic instincts</i>may be used to power the interaction, while the player is adhering to the special demands inherent in tabletop rpgs.<br/><br/>I played "13 at the table" some years ago, and it is a nice little game.

Still, the necessity of meta-game talk is by the definition of our topic (i.e. if there isn't meta-level talk, it isn't a tabletop game) -- whereas it seemed implied that the necessity of meta-level talk was that inherently improves the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206925/#Comment_206925" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T13:21:01+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  1:21PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2009 1:24PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No problem, John. Sorry for confusing you! As I said;<blockquote>Sorry for being a bit shifty in my argumentation here, but that is what you get when an old man thinks aloud ... ;-)</blockquote>I were referring to the other thread too, of course. I am kind of working in paradoxes these days, trying to keep two or more openings to any given theme open at any time (perhaps a paradoxical game will grow from it ...).<br/><br/>I have seen dialogue-based role-playing games being done with no meta-talk at all. It is possible to design functional games for tabletop play, with totally different modes of play than the "normal" one, at least when you throw away all preconceptions of what a "tabletop rpg" should be.<br/><br/>As for the normal dialogue-based role-playing game; the meta-talk is indeed essential to making the game work. It is not very much discussed, of course, but there is lots of advantages to be gained for the game-smith or games master who thinks it through. There seems to be widely agreed that meta-talk is outside the game-play, and may not be influenced by the game method. That is not true. I believe we need to think thoroughly on how a group functions, including on the meta-levels, to make even better games.<br/><br/>But that is not a discussion for this thread.<br/><br/><i>BTW: would have liked to meet you and Emily on Knutepunkt, John, but my mother died, so I never got to go there. I am really thirsting to meet some of you guys from over there, to discuss rpgs face to face. Find such talks more rewarding than any forum, and I see that a lot of you guys have insights I would love to pluck ... or something. :-)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207029/#Comment_207029" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T04:35:40+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  4:35AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2009 4:35AM by MJGraham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I simply do not identify with the characters I roleplay and I'm not interested in whether my characters win or lose .
