Thinking about it, though, I realized that I have the same old problem I did back when I played: the WoD doesn't actually have great mechanics for accomplishing its thematic goals.<br/><br/>I thought I'd ask you wonderful folks for some suggestions for games that <b>do</b> succeed in that vein, and had realization-the-second: part of the reason that WoD doesn't work is that it ultimately engages so many themes, settings, and types of conflict. MonsterHearts definitely covers paranormal teen romance, but it doesn't cover, say, political wrangling, or mythic journeys (something that came up a few times in our WtA games, though one can argue about whether that was really an emergent property of the game or just our implementation.)<br/><br/>So, I guess I have two questions in one: what do you think is one of the most salient themes or conflicts of the old WoD games, and what are story games that you think deliver on them well?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449321/#Comment_449321" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T16:38:32+00:00" title="November  8, 2015  4:38PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Urban Shadows</b> is absolutely the new hotness when it comes to WoD-style urban fantasy. It does that by making the city a centerpiece for intrigue, by using factions mechanically (many of the basic moves interact directly with the factions, and you advance by interacting with all factions). It also folds in a swanky new take on the Morality scale, in the form of Corruption. You mark Corruption when you do something specific to your supernatural archetype. For the Vamp, it's "feed on someone unwilling", for example. As you mark Corruption, you unlock "Corruption Advances" which give you access to power at the price of more corruption.<br/><br/>In terms of the base moves, the basic mechanics of the game, they're all centered around creating and unraveling intrigue: hitting the street for contacts and info, garnering information about people by figuring them out, distracting and tricking people to create opportunities in the moment, and a "get the frell outta here" move.<br/><br/>Oh, and then there's Debt. It works like Strings in Monsterhearts, and that's a pretty essential part of the genre to me. You get Debt on someone when you do them a significant favor. You can do stuff like cash it in (there's a move that lets you cash in a Debt), refuse to honor someone's Debt, and even "drop a name" by mentioning a Debt that you hold over someone else, in order to impress a third party.<br/><br/>So it does cover a narrow slice of the pie, but I think it's closer to what you might be used to: a game where a diverse blend of supernatural creatures have it out and get entangled in myriad plots that all keep intersecting.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not as familiar with it, but there was a game called <b>Undying</b> that was around lately, very strongly keyed to Vampire-specific conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449327/#Comment_449327" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T20:45:14+00:00" title="November  8, 2015  8:45PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second <b><i>Undying</i></b>, a very interesting game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449331/#Comment_449331" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T23:02:31+00:00" title="November  8, 2015 11:02PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely both <b>Undying</b> and <b>Urban Shadows</b> offer a satisfying game experience that covers some (many) of the core elements of Vampire the Masquerade.<br/><br/>Another, non PbtA, alternative is my very own <a href="unplayablegames.blogspot.de/2014/12/fateless.html" rel="nofollow">FateLess</a> especially with the <a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.com.tr/2015/07/bloodless.html" rel="nofollow">BloodLess</a> supplement.<br/>It does not have specifically political mechanics, but it focuses on handling stories of strong protagonist characters, exploring their goals, they actions and their motivations (and the world around them).

If you can articulate your agendas and principles, you're a good way toward explaining what the point of play is, and how MCs can shape play towards those ends. And if you're looking to call out critical moments in the fiction and build structure around those moments, the various existing moves suggest a straightforward way to start doing that.<br/><br/>No one piece of it is that revolutionary! But if what you're writing has an MC handling world-emulation, focuses around specific moments in a genre or setting, and doesn't need much to fiddle with mechanically, it's a great framework to build on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449380/#Comment_449380" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T14:51:09+00:00" title="November 10, 2015  2:51PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should try World of Darkness again but this time do what the instructions say and <i>pick a theme</i>.

But I will say that the more specific your theme is, the better you will be able to get it across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449442/#Comment_449442" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-13T09:19:15+00:00" title="November 13, 2015  9:19AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>Annalise</i></b> is very suitable as a game about <i>one</i> vampire, not as a WoD replacement: its premise is playing normal people in a horror situation. <br/>Vampires in Annalise are monsters; having more than one would be overkill and having rules about their politics would be higher-order overkill.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449446/#Comment_449446" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-13T11:09:46+00:00" title="November 13, 2015 11:09AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote <i>Svart av kval, vit av lust</i> to make a tighter, mechanically non-intrusive vampire game focusing on intrigue and the moral horror of living with the Beast. It's been very popular in the Swedish indie crowd. There's a thread on Story Games where I explain the game <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17821/svart-av-kval-vit-av-lust-i-will-answer-any-questions" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the full game itself is availible for free <a href="http://urverkspel.com/sakval-nedladdningar" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's in Swedish, but you could probably use Google Translate to read it, in combination with the thread above (and I'd be happy to clear up any ambiguities). Check it out if you're interested, either as inspiration or to play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
