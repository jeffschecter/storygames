That's a great situation for a game and all, but if you want to take the framework of Ganakagok and do something else with it, what concerns do you need to deal with?<br/><br/>The point that seems most clear to me is that the Tarot deck needs modified somewhat to match the new milieu/setting/genre/whatever.  The standard Ganakagok Tarot has all these cards like "Two Walrus Fighting" that make sense for Eskimoes but not for, say, chartered acountants or daring space men.  What would be the best way to modify the Tarot deck?  When making up new cards, how much detail should you have?  How specific should they be?  Is there a reason the set includes these specific cards and not some other set of images?<br/><br/><br/><br/>My specific situation is that I'm planning on running a Ganakagok in Space game.  (We hold this truth to be self-evident: Ganakagok is the right system for running a Babylon 5 inspired space opera game.)  So I'm trying to come up with a good set of tarot images.  In this case, I'm going for the big epic, mystical or poetic sort of images that you get when scifi is trying to be about more than just men with laser pistols and warp drives.  "To Boldly Go" and "Our Last, Best Hope for Peace" and the like.  I hope that will help give the game some of the mythic flavor of Ganakagok and/or Bab 5.<br/><br/><br/>I also have a vague plan that goes like this: When a person at the table draws a card from the deck, they interpret the card roughly as normal (look up the meaning on a table, describe how it applies to the situation).  But the meaning are stored in an Excel spreadsheet (or maybe a Google Wave), and after you interpret a card, you can change what that card's image is for the next time that it is drawn.  The Three of Hearts may start out as "All Alone in the Night" (to be alone or unsupported).  But when I draw it and describe how my character decides to leave the village, I then edit the Three of hearts entry, so the next time it is drawn it will be "Twilight of the Empire" (a strong force becomes weakened, or to fail to act in time).  That's the plan, anyway.  We'll see how it works in play.  (It does mean that we want a clear idea what makes good or bad cards so that we can keep seeding good cards, though.)<br/><br/><br/>So how do you hack Ganakagok?  How would you handle this specific application thereof?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262052/#Comment_262052" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T12:01:24+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 12:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow. Cool.<br/><br/>The easiest way to hack the deck is to go back to the drawing board. Assign the suits and values genre- and setting-appropriate meanings, and then "read" those suit/value combinations through a space-operatic interpretive lens.  So for example Spades = Space, Hearts = The Human Factor, Diamonds = Sufficiently Advanced Technology, and Clubs = The Mysterious Universe. And then the values:<br/><br/>Ace = mastery or expertise<br/>2 = duality or opposition, conflict<br/>3 = synthesis or production<br/>4 = balance, harmony, or stasis<br/>5 = change, revolution, chaos<br/>6 = interaction, activity, awareness<br/>7 = paradox or contradiction<br/>8 = extension or connection; a network<br/>9 = the effects of time; duration or entropy<br/>10 = totality, completion, perfection<br/>Jack = human agency or free will<br/>Queen = stereotypical feminine principle<br/>King = stereotypical masculine principle<br/><br/>...and then you free associate. Ace of Spades = The Star-Pilot ("to react quickly to pressing dangers"). Five of Clubs = Fractal Patterns ("to reveal hidden similarities"). Six of Diamonds = Sensor Scan ("to obtain information on a developing situation"). Queen of Hearts = Medical Emergency ("to require care, protection, or treatment"). Keep doing that until you're happy with the results. <br/><br/>The nice part is, with your plan, you can keep the basic "coding" and then just vary the specific interpretation. So after Medical Emergency appears once, it can change to something else that fits the basic Queen of Hearts pattern, like A Sympathetic Ear ("to listen with patience and compassion").<br/><br/>At least, that's my take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262057/#Comment_262057" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T12:12:42+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 12:12PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2010 12:14PM by Cedric P.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Inuits mythology in space could be great!

Partly because we have a list of potential cards with more than 52 entries.  Partly to allow for more player input/investment/participation (why should only I as GM be making the deck?).  Partly to have the input from the deck changing and growing in new directions as play progresses.  Partly just as an experiment to see how we can mess around with the Ganakagok rules.  If it fails, we can always create a single standard deck and use that for the rest of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262322/#Comment_262322" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T12:47:26+00:00" title="March 16, 2010 12:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><br/>What do you think? </blockquote>\nThese are all really good, though a different direction than I was planning to go.

My key concern was, as you've indicated Nick, modifying the tarot deck.  So I made a viking themed deck with various Norse and Viking images, titled the card based on what the image showed, included a theme for the card, and then added some Nordic poetry (havamal-inspired).  So, for example, a card with Baldur on a funeral pyre was titled 'the Funeral of Baldur' (brilliant!), the theme was something like, 'fall of the mighty', but I forget the actual poems.  I played with a group of players who were familiar with Ganakagok so that may have made the experiment easier.  In play, the card theme seemed to be what players keyed on in interpreting the card to narrate events.  I thought the image or the poem was going to be the main driver.  <br/>Another issue in a Vikings game was the location map.  Rather than start with a blank map, I think we added a few points from the beginning of possible places--certainly various locations in Europe and maybe even Greenland, Iceland, North America, etc...<br/>In the game, the Bifrost Bridge ended up destroyed and the characters all were sucked down a whirlpool into Hela's domain.

B5 is about compelling characters (which Ganakgok can do well), a sense of oncoming inevitable change and trying to deal with them (which Ganakagok does really amazingly well), a mix of interpersonal and action oriented conflicts (again), and a sense that the events are big mythic, epic events (heck yeah, Ganakgok does that).  And the feeling that, while the story is about big sweeping events larger than any character, the main characters are at the center of what is happening and can have the chance of changing things for the better or for the worse.  <br/><br/>Everything that compels me regarding the show is captured in the game.  (Honestly, I've been looking for a good system for playing B5 since I first saw it a decade ago, and none seemed near as appropriate as Ganakagok.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262802/#Comment_262802" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T12:40:34+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 12:40PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it'd be fun to keep the name "Forgotten Ones" and then see who they turn out to have actually been -- Vorlons, Shadows, or both.<br/><br/>As the impetus for a lot of the change, humans or the B5 station itself could take the place of the Sun.

"Ancestors" governs your home planet/space station, check.  "Forgotten Ones" are the ancient aliens like the Vorlons and Shadows and that dude who brings Sheridan back, so they govern space at large.  "Sun" and "Stars" fit a science fiction theme fine as-is.<br/><br/><br/>(I'm not planning on the game being strict B5 fan-fiction so much as an homage, you know?

Otherwise, I think they work great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266032/#Comment_266032" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T21:44:46+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  9:44PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another idea for using Ganakagok for something else:  Close Encounters of the Third Kind / Contact / V / The Day the Earth Stood Still alien encounter/first contact scenario.

The alien contact genre is sufficiently familiar to most folks that they'll be able to invent situations and consequences when prompted by a thematically appropriate card. The Space Opera deck that I started talking about above would actually work pretty well for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282513/#Comment_282513" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T15:37:13+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  3:37PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 3:38PM by NickWedig.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend of mine is gonna be running Ganakagok sometime soon, wherein all the player characters are Skesis from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083791/" rel="nofollow">the Dark Crystal</a>.

Remember that the whole point of establishing each character's Truth-Vision, Change-Hope, and Change-Fear at the beginning of the game is to push characters to be proactive, to give them an immediate goal towards which they can act. If being in denial meant that the player would be blocking or turtling or just <i>not doing anything</i>, that would be no good. So the circumstances in which I'd permit a player to say, "Oh, yeah, my guy's in denial," would be if that denial were such that the character would be moved to aggressively quash other character's efforts to deal with the change because it was important to them that everyone carry on as they always had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283827/#Comment_283827" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-31T10:48:34+00:00" title="July 31, 2010 10:48AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hadn't thought about people using their denial to block or turtle.

It actually worked real well. Especially considering that two players were new to Ganakagok (one new to roleplaying in general!) and that the GM was new to GMing Ganakagok.  Everyone said that they had a good time and were pleased with how it went.<br/><br/>Skeksis were chosen because their situation is about A) a great big oncoming, unavoidable change that could be good or bad and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> politicking and infighting among the tribe.  These seem to match out how Ganakagok has worked for us in our previous regular games of Ganakagok.  Getting a setting that fit the Ganakagok mechanics meant that most of the game fell into place from there (especially with the modified deck).<br/><br/><br/>Not much gameplay occurred outside the Skeksis castle, though two PCs left at various times.  The world map was still plenty relevant (I'll have to scan it in when I get the chance, as it is the best Ganakagok maps that we've made), because people invoked details from it to argue why they should stay in the castle.  Still, I've also seen character and groups in straight Ganakagok that stayed in the village for nearly the entire game.<br/><br/><br/>The modified card deck seemed to work nicely.  The imagery was thematic and helped inspire the right sort of weird hippy fantasy narration.  I had weighted the deck to be slightly more negative than the generic Ganakagok deck.  More cards had meanings related to doing horrible things and having bad things done to you than normal.  This doesn't unbalance the game, since the player still decides who gets ill-used if they win or the GM gets to decide if the player loses.  But it meant that more negative situations started scenes and more being mean and nasty to each other when you won narration, which fit with the Skeksis character in general.  Deliberately tilting the deck one way or the other could be a useful technique if you're going to modify Ganakagok for other purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
