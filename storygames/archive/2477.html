                    I ran five Faery's Tale demos at DunDraCon in San Ramon this past weekend, with from 2 to 8 people playing at a time. I had a good mix of kids &amp; adults (not just parents) in most of the sessions. We played the Tournament of the Fey intro pack adventure, since it's already structured to gradually introduce the rules in a relaxed storyline - it's a faery festival, so the players can spend some time wandering around competing in contests &amp; getting a feel for the game without a lot of pressure to rush off &amp; save the world. :)<br/>
<br/>
The last game was particularly wild, with 4-5 adults who were experienced story games players. They had a lot of fun with the plot twist rules, changing the adventure around quite a bit from the originaly storyline (which is great &amp; all part of the game). Instead of fighting a dark faery at the climax to challenge his claim to marry a pixie princess, they tricked him into riding a pooka who'd changed form into a crow, and the pooka dumped him in a lake, where he got swallowed by a frog.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if any folks here played in the games, I'm glad we got a chance to meet &amp; I hope you had a good time!                </div>

                            That's really cool that you took the time to run FT five times!<br/><br/>I'm curious how the table dynamics were having parents and kids at the same table.

Sure! Neat topic. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Actually, I don't think I've run a game with all kids yet. As for mixed groups, it really depends on the kids &amp; their ages. One of the boys who played with his parents definitely took a lot of cues from them, but it turned out to be very handy to have them there because he had a hard time with losing or things going wrong for his faery in the game, so they were able to deal with that much better than I could have. And it was very neat to watch his dad, in particular, using the game to teach him about being a good sport - having his faery go over to congratulate the winner when they lost a contest &amp; so forth. And I was able to reinforce that in the game by giving their faeries Essence rewards (the Narrator rewards actions that make the game more fun with Essence, which is the magical life force of the faeries plus useful in lots of other ways). In the 8-player game, it was split between adults &amp; kids. One father watched his two girls play, and the other kids were older &amp; on their own (they'd come over from the kids room next door). So when the players disagreed about what to do, they were mostly able to resolve it through discussion, and sometimes they followed what the kids wanted to do, sometimes what the adults wanted. In fact, the two girls whose father was watching came up with some of the best ideas all on their own - one played a pooka who changed form into a beaver for the wood-carving contest (which came about because I mentioned a riddling contest, which another player misheard as a "whittling contest," and I said, that's a great idea for a contest, let's do that instead - and have an Essrence reward).<br/><br/>I did notice the all-adult groups were more willing to go a little wilder - not so much in terms of bawdiness or grimness, but in changing the story - than the mixed groups. So I suspect the adults in mixed groups may be holding back a little to keep things on track for the  younger players.                        </div>

                            Cool, that's really nice detail.  Amazinging how much you can learn about table behavior just from running some games!  The most interesting comments I thought were about parents who were <b>watching</b> their kids play but not actually playing.  When I ran The Princes Kingdom for my niece and nephew <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22873.0" rel="nofollow">recently</a>, it was interesting see my mother (their grandmother) react to situations in the game while half-listening to the game.

I suspect you are probably right.  But I think my worry was that by mixing the groups the potential would be there for the older people to (perhaps unknowingly) end up dominating play.  Maybe I'm wrong to think that.                        </div>

I wish you'd been able to make it, too. I don't know about Go Play NW - it looks pretty cool, but I already have a full con schedule this spring here in California plus I'll be going to GenCon again in August, so vacation time &amp; finances for a July trip may not be feasible.                        </div>

                            I got to play in your last game (the one with the 4-5 adults) and enjoyed it greatly. I must admit that I was kind of dismissive of Faery's Tale when I first looked at it. It's not that I thought it was a bad game, it just wasn't what I was looking for.<br/><br/>Actual play, as always, made a big difference. I have a much greater appreciation of the game now, I plan on picking up a copy the next time I am in my FLGS.                        </div>

                            I'm glad you enjoyed the game. Did you play a brownie in the last game? I'm afraid I don't recall who played which faeries; by that point of the con, I was getting a little tired. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>We are selling into distribution through Key 20, so you ought to be able to find or order a copy through your FLGS, which I encourage.
