It's largely been in service of trying to improve the play experience for the play-by-email games of Callisto that I've run.<br/><br/>Callisto was designed (by Brad Murray) specifically for the play-by-email format, with asynchronous play via the players writing in-character letters.<br/><br/>As such, I've <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P632qZnyCTn0O-shXsQAOUnasw5elxovD9i7TBdJGIA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">put together a set of new rules</a> for the next session I plan to run. Hopefully they're comprehensible without knowing the base rules in detail. (That would be useful feedback in itself.)<br/><br/>I'm also trying some new rules for parts of the game. While I know playtesting is the only way to really know if they'll work, any reactions to how they sound would also be welcome.<br/><br/>I've compiled some actual play from previous sessions: <a href="http://revolution.isaackarth.com/img/CoCMissives_Book.pdf" rel="nofollow">Colony of Callisto</a>, <a href="http://revolution.isaackarth.com/img/tower_of_callisto_book.pdf" rel="nofollow">Tower of Callisto</a>. One of my other goals is to provide resources for other people who want to run one of these games. My notes on the GMing procedures are currently a bit sketchy, but hopefully comprehensible.<br/><br/>I should say up front that the core of this design is all by Brad Murray. I've been elaborating and playtesting, but the heart of the game is the same.<br/><br/>(I admit an ulterior motive for posting: I like Callisto and think it should be better known. And I want more design advice!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463670/#Comment_463670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-02T23:05:15+00:00" title="June  2, 2017 11:05PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting business here; a shame no one's commented.<br/><br/>Am I right that this is a purely PbEM game?<br/><br/>I like how deliberate and explicit the text is about how the game is best played; I only skimmed it, but it looks like it would orient the players very well.<br/><br/>Which rules are you most excited about, and why?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463675/#Comment_463675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-03T04:15:49+00:00" title="June  3, 2017  4:15AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the rules, the game is purely PbEM. A bit more literally than most play-by-mail games, since the characters are writing letters to each other. Most times the game has been run have included an additional website or G+ community or the like for posting the ref's news posts and for OOC discussion, but that's purely optional.<br/><br/>The how-it's-played-advice has developed over the course of several games based on the questions people tend to ask, so it's good that it sounds like it worked for you. I can't take credit for all of it: Brad Murray started it off with a light touch that I've tried to preserve while clarifying in more detail.<br/><br/>For the base game of Callisto, I'm excited about how well dividing the narrative authority between players has worked. Unlike many other PbP or PbEM games, the asynchronous nature and the distributed adjudication are perfectly suited to email communication.<br/><br/>For these revised rules specifically, I'm excited about two things: first, making the implicit narrative authorities explicit. Having observed several games in action (playing and refereeing) this is something that tends to crop up frequently in actual play. Figuring out where the limit of the player's narrative authority is one of the things new players tend to have trouble grasping. Making that more understandable will hopefully help.<br/><br/>Second, the National Assembly rule, which gives all of the players a central focus. One problem with my previous games has been that the players don't always have enough of a common interest to communicate about. Rather than hoping they'll construct one spontaneously, this time I'm starting them out with some explicit debates. Plus, it lets them shore up any gaps in the setup. <br/><br/>(I also think the National Assembly is nicely balanced: the intent is that players with characters currently out of political power can still describe the bad things that will happen as a consequence, giving them a way to disrupt the status quo.)<br/><br/>One big problem for people running it is, I think, setting up the initial scenario. That part is not obvious from reading the Callisto rules, and I feel like I'm still fumbling around with aspects of it myself.<br/><br/>I'm still setting out some of the details for the setup. Some things I'm trying this time:<br/>- Codifying all of the narrative authorities under an "inventory" that recognizes that players tend to "own" the stuff they want to talk about.<br/>- Giving characters relationship descriptions for their initial contacts to set the tone of the initial exchange (borrowed from ViewScream's scenarios, Fiasco's stuff, and DW's bonds). While some people like improving from scratch, I think most people find the blank-page especially intimidating in a social context.<br/>- Having a handful of big, important variables for all of the players to tug at, like the loyalty of the army and the state of the national treasury. <br/><br/>(Well, the real biggest problem is recruiting players and sustaining the game: I'm leaning towards advising against leaving the game open-ended, because it will tend to peter out eventually unless there's a constant infusion of fresh blood. How to end something like this is a trick in itself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
