For my next play, I'd like to simplify a few things.<br/><br/><b>Two types of traits</b><br/>The original game features Power, Attitudes and Styles (which come in powered and non-powered flavors). I'd reduce that to Powered Traits and Non-Powered Traits. Supers can have 4 Powered and 4 Non-Powered Traits or 3 and 5, respectively. Mundane characters have anything from 3 to 5 non-powered traits.<br/><br/>This way, I hope, characters become more concise. It's faster to make up 8 traits than 12, also conflicts might get shorter which I consider a good thing.<br/><br/><br/><b>No point-buy for Drives</b><br/>Usually undifferentiated characters get a threshold of 5, and differentiated characters get 9 points to distribute between 5 drives.<br/><br/>I'd give undifferentiated characters a threshold of 4, and differentiated characters get 3 drives: one at level 4, one at level 3, one at level 2.<br/><br/>I think 3 drives is a good number to handle. Also an array is easier to handle than point-buy.<br/><br/><br/><b>No reactions</b><br/>Reactions slow the game down. Furthermore we never manged to apply a meaningful difference between actions and reactions in the fiction.<br/><br/>So there are no reactions per se. Players can spend story tokens to take an additional action after any player has acted. If they like the intervening player can describe their additional action in a reactional kind of manner.<br/><br/><br/><b>Simple turn structure</b><br/>The turn structure in Capes is quite complicated. First there is a phase for claiming sided, then players take their actions. Afterwards conflicts are checked for winning. Then the turn starter is skipped and the next turn begins.<br/><br/>I'd reduce this to a single phase: Players take turns and can claim a side during their actions. A player wins a conflict at the start of his turn, when his side is highest and he has claimed the side. This way it is even possible to have multiple players claim the same side.<br/><br/><br/><b>A reward for passing</b><br/>In Capes there are rewards for winning and for loosing. There is no reward for not playing. I feel that is is not a good thing. Sometimes you want only two characters in a scene, even if there are four players at a table.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I'd rather do. Players who do not play a character in a secne could get to decide what scene is next. Or they could have advantages in creating conflicts. Maybe only players who do not play a character can create Events.<br/><br/><br/>What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318068/#Comment_318068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T11:17:54+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 11:17AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's an implicit passing mechanism: increasing your Inspirations.<br/><br/>I'd have to see how to rest play out.

You can play the scenery or themes or overall events. In one game I played in, aliens attacked. In that scene, nobody played an actual character. One person played the alien fleet, another person played New York City, and another person played Alien Invasion. Have you tried this yet?<br/><br/>You mention a couple times that you want Conflicts to be shorter. Are you guys creating and participating in conflicts that you actually care about? Could you give me some examples of conflicts that went too long? I've noticed that new Capes players tend to create a lot of shitty conflicts and scenes and conflicts can really drag as a result. Like, Captain Thunder defeats the Gray Mask is a really boring conflict new players in my Capes games make. Captain Thunder humiliates Gray Mask, though, gets people at the table fired up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318074/#Comment_318074" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T11:58:08+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 11:58AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I'd have to see how to rest play out. My gut says that losing reactions would dramatically cut down on the die rolls, and cause a lot of conflicts to fizzle out very early."<br/><br/>The first part, is my intention. I'm not sure about how early conflicts would end. Earlier then with RAW would be fine for me, though.<br/><br/><br/>"No Reactions - I throw you through a wall. You come flying out of the wall and punch me in the face. Those are an action and a reaction fictionally."<br/><br/>Probably, but that's not how it works in play. In play it's very awkward to check who wants to take a reaction. Then other people might want to take reactions as well. It's the part of the game that really kills tension for me.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"How would you end up ranking the traits? 5-2?"<br/><br/>As usual. Assigning 1 to the lowest than going up.<br/><br/><br/>"Drives - Not a bad change. I've always found 1pt Drives to be nearly useless. Why the reduction in drive for undifferentiated characters?"<br/><br/>That way, differentiating a character just means adding to a character. You keep the 4 you have, assign a category to it and take two additional drives. It makes for a smoother transition, if you want to expand on a character.<br/><br/><br/>"Simple Turn Structure - I think one thing Capes could benefit from is a more procedural turn order. I'm not mentally able to picture how what you're describing would work though."<br/><br/>Hmmm. Maybe I don't have the right idea of what you mean by "procedural". But IMO Capes could use a less procedural turn structure. That's why I came up with this idea.<br/><br/><br/>"A Reward for Passing - You currently don't have to play a character in a scene. You can play the scenery or themes or overall events. In one game I played in, aliens attacked. In that scene, nobody played an actual character. One person played the alien fleet, another person played New York City, and another person played Alien Invasion. Have you tried this yet?"<br/><br/>Yes, of course. But there really is no incentive not to do so, and Capes is generally strong because of giving incentives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
