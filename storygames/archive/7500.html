Seems it's out now and even has a supercheap pdf thing going on.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering: What is it about? Is it good? Why should (or shouldn't) I buy it?<br/><br/>I only know that it's made by John Wick, is presumably fantasy and seems to use the FATE rules in some way. (At least SotC is listed as a Related Product on IPR and I think I remember hearing something like that.)<br/><br/>So, anybody who already has the pdf wants to end my ignorance? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166464/#Comment_166464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T10:35:11+00:00" title="September  1, 2008 10:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All I know is that how well dressed you are matters!

However, there is also a system that determines narrative authority, shifts power around the table, and unifies resolution. <br/><br/>How well it'll all work I can't say, but it is a different thing than the old games so far as system paradigm goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain" title="coffeestain"><img alt="coffeestain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain">coffeestain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166501/#Comment_166501" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T16:22:17+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  4:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For $5 it's hard not to justify picking the game up.  I think it's got a lot of neat ideas in it and the core system seems to be really neat, though I don't think it's nearly as elegant as it could be.  The wagers system is fantastic.  John sort of neuters Aspects as presented in SotC, but goes on to say you can play with them un-neutered if you like.  My biggest complaint about the game is John's writing style/voice.  To me, it's the most off-putting writing I've ever read in an RPG (and this from a HUGE one-time fan of both L5R &amp; 7th Sea).  It's so off-putting that I'm not sure I'll ever finish actually reading the book.  Certainly, that won't be the case for everyone.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh" title="JasonLeigh"><img alt="JasonLeigh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh">JasonLeigh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166512/#Comment_166512" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T18:10:49+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  6:10PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel's right that the style and voice are unique.  John states right up front that he's writing in the style of Ven literature - and goes on to describe aspects of that literature, and then makes no apology for the style (although the fact that he felt the need to describe it at all could be taken as an apology).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only part of the writing that I objected to was the part of the introduction where John say's this is the anti D&amp;D.;  Not that I'm a D&amp;D; fanboy - I've played more than my fair share - just that any comparisons of "how this game isn't like these other games over here" always seems cheapen the message of the game.  My opinion is - let the work stand on it's own, and leave the comparisons for those reading/playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the system, I think the wagering mechanic reads like it's very clean - but it remains for actual play to highlight if the search and handling time is within tolerable limits (for me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166523/#Comment_166523" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T20:04:14+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  8:04PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JasonLeigh</cite>My opinion is - let the work stand on it's own, and leave the comparisons for those reading/playing the game.</blockquote>Normally I'd agree, but my understanding is that this was a driving force in designing the game.

There's a lot of player narrative control built into the dice mechanics. I like the way players can choose to roll less dice in order to make wagers, that allow them to shape the fiction. The setting is evocative and I love that the fiction of the game is very consciously imitating the conventions of ven blood opera rather than trying to be realistic or simmy. So, the bad guys are pale and red eyed. The world is moody and dark, with love and death in the air. Art and fashion are important, love is always deadly, and you can rely on a noble's word, except when they are lying.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I've heard suggestions that he was actively attempting to make a game that does all the things that, traditionally, D&amp;D doesn't do or at least does very poorly.</blockquote>The game is defnitely a reaction to the D&amp;D that he was exposed to, which was pretty stereotypical kill monsters take stuff.

It's five dollars.  I've given five dollars to people who I did not know and expected nothing from in return.  There's no question I'll give someone five dollars for a four-hundred-plus page roleplaying book about the political and emotional maneuverings of an ancient operatic race of escaped sorcerously-constructed slaves.<br/><br/>Having read it, I certainly want to play it.  I want to accumulate holdings.  I want to be awesomely capable at somethings and awesomely doomed at others.  I want to love and hate furiously.<br/><br/>I understand that this is not what everyone wants, but if that sounds like you and you have <b>five stinking bucks</b>, then yeah, <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16617" rel="nofollow">buy the damn thing</a>.<br/><br/>Before I read the book, I found the gimmick to be transparent and eye-roll worthy.  Now, I'm not so sure.  Reading a book that claims to be an attempt at authentically replicating something fictional has sucked me in, somehow...It's magical thinking, in a way.  It's as if, before you ever start making a character, you're already being invited to <em>roleplay yourself</em>, in a world where scholars of the esoteric study the mysterious civilizations of Lemuria, Mu and Atlantis.  I was quite struck when I recognized that impulse.  Raised on Kenneth Hite and Grant Morrison and whoever else, I prefer my histories to be crazy rather than truthful (whenever they conflict, I mean).  This is a book that lets you become cooler just by reading and thinking about it, by taking up the mantle of this alternate past.  It reminds me a lot of Hite's talk of reality quakes, where sections of time subduct under a moment, just like tectonic plates at a fault line, and all of a sudden the past is different from what it used to be.  Specifically, it reminds me of "pragmaclasts," artifacts from the subducted time-strata, "thrown up" by whatever forces are responsible for such things.  Diaries in unknown languages.  Records of wars that never happened.  A roleplaying game based on a civilization that never existed.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm more in the "delighted" camp, lately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166597/#Comment_166597" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T09:52:25+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  9:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Scurvy_Platypus</cite>And the usual question I have these days...<br/><br/>How is this game going to be with only 1 player?
