The assertion is that mind-reading is <i>inherently</i> not fun.  So why would I want to look there, of all places, for fun?<br/><br/>Well, one reason why this keeps cropping up in play is because <i>sometimes</i> there are <i>some</i> parts of it that <i>are</i> fun.  Check this out:<br/><br/>(italics = character speech)\n<blockquote>GM: (looks away briefly) <i>Well, sirs, I really would help you if I could</i> (wrings hands) <i>but I don't know anything about the Alley Stalker.</i> (looks down)<br/><br/>Player 1: <i>I understand your position, but look, if we can find the Alley Stalker, we will take him down!  Then no one will have anything more to fear from him.</i><br/><br/>GM: (hopeful but skeptical expression)<br/><br/>Player 2: <i>We have a safe house.  Give us something we can use, and we'll escort you there, to stay until this is all over.</i><br/><br/>GM: <i>You promise I'll be safe?  Very well, then.  Here's what I've seen...</i></blockquote>\nThis is one version of the interaction, and I think it has a lot going for it.  But because it's hard to rely on this method every time, a lot of games have chosen another solution, where the players' way forward looks like this:\n<blockquote>Player 1: I roll Persuasion to get him to tell me what he knows.  15.  Success!  Right?<br/><br/>GM: Right.  He tells you what he's seen...</blockquote>\nSome designers have noticed that this can be flat in play, and so have added on the requirement that players show their skill uses in the fiction, which can look like this:\n<blockquote>Player 1: <i>Greetings, sir!  My friend and I are here to help your community and put an end to the Alley Stalker!  Now we've heard you might be able to help us.  Tell us all you know, and we swear to deal with him!</i>  I roll Persuasion to get him to tell me what he knows.  15.  Success!  Right?<br/><br/>GM: Right.  <i>Very well, then.  Here's what I've seen...</i></blockquote>\nMany roleplayers consider this to be good enough.  And if you have a whole group who wants more play-acting in there, they can of course embellish:\n<blockquote>GM: (looks away briefly) <i>Well, sirs, I really would help you if I could</i> (wrings hands) <i>but I don't know anything about the Alley Stalker.</i> (looks down)<br/><br/>Player 1: <i>Look, if we can find the Alley Stalker, we will take him down!  These streets will be safe and you will have been a great help to your community.</i><br/><br/>GM: (skeptical expression)<br/><br/>Player 2: <i>Give us something we can use, and we'll reward you handsomely!  How does 15 coppers strike you?</i>  I roll Persuasion.  15.  Success!  Right?<br/><br/>GM: Right.  <i>Very well, then.  Might I also ask for some protection?  Whatever you can offer would be most welcome!  Here's what I've seen...</i></blockquote>\nSo, the fiction winds up quite similar to my first example.  We've got just as much color and fictional detail.  The big difference is not in product, but in process.  <br/><br/>In this last example, everyone added flavor and portrayal to the scene as befit their taste, rolled to resolve the key matter of interest, and worked the roll result into their ongoing portrayal.  <br/><br/>In the first example, on the other hand, the GM and players attempted to <i><b>communicate via the fiction</b> regarding the key matter of interest</i>.  Upon successful completion of this communication, the matter was resolved.  Fictionally, the characters succeeded because they deduced the NPC's needs and concocted a way to meet them.  At the table, the players succeeded for the same reason, deducing the NPC's needs by way of close attention to the GM's portrayal, and the GM approved their solution in similar fashion, by paying close attention to the level of reassurance offered in words, tone, action, and promises.<br/><br/>Now this is clearly a matter of taste, but I think communicating via the fiction in this context is <i>awesome</i>.  I mean, yeah, as a player, I can enjoy simply answering the question of whether I get info... and yeah, I can enjoy taking that and dressing it up with some character-acting... but what I enjoy <i>most</i> is when our acting and narrating has some <i>challenge</i> and some <i>stakes</i>.  Not because I always love those things for their own sake, but because we listen to each other in a different way when they're present.  We hang on each other's every word, the players looking for vital clues, the GM looking for solutions or gaffes.  That kind of intense interaction has generated probably 90% of the most fun RPG scenes I've played, over decades in the hobby.<br/><br/><i>That's</i> why it's worth bothering to refine this process.  Because when it works (if your taste is like mine), it's The Best.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that most readers know what it looks like when it <i>doesn't work</i>, and especially when it turns out like failed mind-reading:\n<blockquote>GM: <i>Well, sirs, I really would help you if I could, but I don't know anything about the Alley Stalker.</i><br/><br/>Player 1: <i>Don't hold out on us, you lout!  We have good reason to believe you know something!  You aren't allied with him, are you?!</i><br/><br/>GM: The old man runs away!<br/><br/>Player 2: I run him down and tackle him!<br/><br/>GM: He curls up into a ball and cries and you don't get anything useful out of him.  Now what?<br/><br/>Player 1: That was our main lead!  What the hell?!<br/><br/>GM: Sorry.  Being aggressive didn't work.<br/><br/>Player 2: How were we supposed to know that?<br/><br/>GM: He was scared...<br/><br/>Player 1: He was?</blockquote>\nSo the challenge is to eliminate <i>that</i> without eliminating the need for players and GMs to hang on each other's every word.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'd like to explore design solutions (advising everyone to hone their acting and people-reading skills doesn't seem very helpful to me).  I think that with a little better system of feedback, we can make communicating via the fiction more accessible to non-actors.  <br/><br/>What I have in mind is something like Charades:<br/>- Being a good actor <i>helps</i>, but is not <i>required</i>.<br/>- We <i>know</i> this is an attempt at communication, and we <i>accept</i> certain obstacles in order to make a challenging game of it.  Instead of the gestures of Charades or the whispers of Telephone, we use fiction and all the limits we've included with it.<br/>- When solutions are tested, knowledge is updated.  ("Is it <i>Gone With the Wind?</i>"  "No.")<br/>- The endeavor <i>will</i> come to a definite <i>end</i>, with either success, permanent failure, or failure until you can try again with new resources.<br/><br/>I haven't really gotten thinking on how to achieve that yet.  <b>Anyone else who shares my enthusiasm for this sort of play: any ideas?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440355/#Comment_440355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-22T13:39:15+00:00" title="November 22, 2014  1:39PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2014 1:39PM by Rickard.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you extend the explanation of the obstacles a little bit? Because it can breed a mind where the game master should make things difficult for the players, and then the game is steered through game master bias. The last example isn't to me a failed mind-reading. It's about the game master not willing to "give everything away" aka "not making things to easy for the players". A mindset born from the thought that the game master should create obstacles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440358/#Comment_440358" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-22T14:06:39+00:00" title="November 22, 2014  2:06PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What it looks like is happening is that the GM isn't giving away the fact that there's something up, but is able to create an atmosphere of suspicion. The challenge and satisfaction comes with a solving of the puzzle: there's something up, and the players need to dig a little more. In one sense, it's trying to play the Hot-Cold game while subtly communicating with the players the whole time.<br/><br/>I think I can see where you're coming from, and one main challenge in RPGs is that it's an extra level of mechanics to resolve: you need to play a social game with the GM to determine when you need to use your character's social mechanics. The problems start arising when the players misinterpret the situation as you've set it out.<br/><br/>In that vein, I guess it does start to feel like the GM is forcing the players along the preset path that they've picked. If you don't figure out that you're supposed to get information from this person, then the game just stalls until someone gets frustrated and the GM spills it.<br/><br/>What I think you want is some sort of clarity in the game. Imagine, for instance, that the GM had some indicator that they could flag a situation with. Think of it as "Spidey-Sense". It's a neutral indicator (such as flipping over a card) that something's not quite right, and that the PCs should dig. If the card's flipped, now the players know that they need to find something in particular, and the game's afoot. Maybe even couple it with a non-random mechanic like GUMSHOE's spends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440360/#Comment_440360" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-22T14:45:09+00:00" title="November 22, 2014  2:45PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I grew up doing the first method. There were no rules for interpersonal interactions. <br/><br/>The rules in D20 systems now just need a single roll and skip the roleplaying. <br/><br/>There should be a set of challenges the player has to meet to convince someone to act a certain way. <br/><br/>You get the roll when you find the angle, but even with the roll it doesn't just mean the player gets the info. Maybe he reveals his reservation. Which allows another roll. If the player can offer something to deal with his reservation. <br/><br/>So it would work like this:<br/><br/>GM: (looks away briefly) Well, sirs, I really would help you if I could (wrings hands) but I don't know anything about the Alley Stalker. (looks around scared)<br/><br/>Player 1: I understand your position, but look, if we can find the Alley Stalker, we will take him down! Then no one will have anything more to fear from him. (I rolled a 18 persuasion!, success right!!!)<br/><br/>GM: (Yes) I fear him. He hunts for me. I'll never be safe (He wrings his hands and looks over shoulder)<br/><br/>Player 2: We have a safe house. Give us something we can use, and we'll escort you there, to stay until this is all over. (I rolled a 15 persuasion, success?)<br/><br/>GM: (Yes) You promise I'll be safe? Very well, then. Here's what I've seen...<br/><br/>OR-FAIL-------------<br/><br/>Player 2: We have a safe house. Give us something we can use, and we'll escort you there, to stay until this is all over. (I rolled a 13 persuasion, success?)<br/><br/>GM: (No) I don't know. If you get me to the safe house then I might be persuaded to talk.<br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>So it requires interplay to get the rolls.

A few things come to mind (most of which aren't direct answers to your conundrum):<br/><br/>1. The need for a fair way for players to deduce what they need to do strikes me as a symptom worth examining.  For example, imagine a linear campaign where the GM has pre-planned that the PCs have to take a particular conversational tack with an NPC in order to get the clue: the players are going to get frustrated if there isn't a way for them to figure out what the "right" approach is.<br/><br/>But in a more freewheeling game, it would seem that accidentally insulting the barkeep is fine, as long as the players can still talk to the rest of the staff, poke around the tavern, ask other villagers about the barkeep to drum up more leverage, etc.<br/><br/>The phrase that keeps coming to mind is "surface area of agency." A roadblock NPC presents only a narrow surface area. If that's the situation, I can see wanting to look for ways to increase the surface area of player agency <i>within the conversation</i>.<br/><br/>But if you accept that the NPC (or just this particular conversation) is part of a large surface area upon which the players can act, then it seems it's fine for the conversation to turn into a dead end.  (Naturally, colorful and clue-filled dead-ends are preferred.)<br/><br/>2. I can imagine a stylized etiquette, where certain phrases the GM utters are code words that indicate particular avenues of approach.  (I'm thinking of the meaningful phrases within Polaris, just uttered in character.)  A sort of conversational tea ceremony.<br/><br/>I'm having trouble imagining this working unless the clues are dead obvious, though; I keep seeing a table erupt into, "Hey, that's not fair, you totally dropped your tone of voice when you replied to my question about airships - that indicated the NPC was going to be vulnerable to placating! But then you ignored my placating statement. I made like.. four of them!"<br/><br/>3. So, Amber RPG is Diceless, but it has an essay about swordfighting to prime both GM and players on the texture of duels, the factors that are relevant and should be part of the conversation.  Despite the fact that sword-fighters are described by a single number (e.g. Warfare: 42), this leads to a fairly nuanced and rich sword-fighting experience. A similar essay like that about talking to NPCs seems useful.<br/><br/>For example, let's say you guess wrong and become aggressive, and the farmer curls up into a ball. Rather than pop out of game play by deeming the GM's portrayal as somehow "unfair", the players (having read the essay) knew this was a possible outcome, and were prepared for it.  This doesn't need to be a dead end, because the group has pre-agreed options that could work - pat the guy on the back, rotate in the "good cop," buy him a whiskey and switch to being reasonable, whatever.  The GM is armed to recognize this as an attempt to coax the farmer out of his fear (because the GM read the essay too).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440374/#Comment_440374" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-23T00:24:36+00:00" title="November 23, 2014 12:24AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In all the responses so far, I see insights I'd like to use, but I also see obstacles that I'd need to address first.  I'll go one by one:<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, here are some of the ways this play style can fail:<br/>- GM isn't even aware he's using "read my NPC" as a requirement for progress<br/>- players didn't buy into playing that sort of game<br/>- players have agreed to play that sort of game, but didn't realize this particular scene would go that way<br/>- GM fails to provide useful signals and actionable info<br/>- players fail to pay attention to the GM's portrayal<br/>- the converse of the previous two; uncommunicative players, inattentive GM<br/>- everyone gives a solid effort, but when the players and GM don't complete the communication successfully, no one knows where to go from there<br/><br/>I figure a game that includes the proper social dynamics as part of its pitch will cover the first three items on that list, so my focus here is on troubleshooting the rest.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a>, I think your flag suggestion fixes the "I didn't know we had to read <i>this</i> guy!" problem, but doesn't address the murkiness of the ensuing back-and-forth.  A non-random spend, if it <i>gets</i> the players something, can take the focus off the speech itself, in the same way die rolls can.  I think that it might be fine to include mechanical input somewhere in the process, but unless the <i>most</i> important work is done by the words, you lose that "hanging on every word" dynamic that I love.  Do you have any thoughts on a useful way to incorporate a Gumshoe-style spend within those constraints?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">@chaiboy</a>, I've definitely played some games where you roll on a more minute scale, and I don't think that inherently has anything to do with generating the style of verbal interaction that I like.  Going from caring about one die roll to caring about several isn't an improvement in my book.  However, there are some other elements in your example that I like a lot!  It seems like the players aren't allowed to roll Persuasion to "get what they want"; rather, they're only allowed to roll it to respond to an immediate prompt.  How far a successful roll gets them depends on what the prompt was.  If the style of interaction I like is rolling along fairly smoothly, this seems like a good way to inject some concrete feedback into it.  However, what about when it isn't going so smoothly?<br/><br/>Suppose the GM has in mind that the NPC is scared, and does their best to portray that.  The player fails to get that, instead judging them to be insolent, and tries a persuasive tactic of threatening rather than reassuring.  What happens then?  If the player gets to roll Persuasion with solid odds of success, then we've short-circuited the need to care about the GM's performance and defeated the entire purpose of this thread's endeavor.  If the player doesn't get to roll Persuasion (or gets to roll with terrible odds), we need to know what happens at the table at that moment.  Any thoughts?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Dirk">@Dirk</a>, I agree that AW moves offer some nice options in that the broad Move definitions require fiction-specific refinement.  No roll in AW is going to tell you "you persuade the NPC to help you" completely regardless of what's going on in the fiction.  Then again, the same is true in D20; we still need to know <i>what </i>we're persuading them to do, and verify that that's within the bounds of the rules and fictional plausibility.  I've played a few AW campaigns myself, and spoken to others who've played it in very different styles.  The impression I get is that it varies by GM and by social contract.  Some GMs <i>always</i> Announce Future Badness in unmistakable fashion, handing the players all the info they need to pick the actions and Moves that will actually benefit them in the situation.  Other GMs challenge the players to assess the situation (beyond just rolling Read and picking a result) in order to choose an action that will actually achieve their top priority.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to think of all this.  The one thing I know for sure is that, if I wanted my friends to play AW with intense attention to their own speech and the GM's, I'd first have to kill their characters several times for inattentiveness, to break their expectations, and I'd also have to lecture them about "I don't care if the rules leave this open, and I don't care what so and so said on the internet; we're doing it <i>this</i> way."  <br/><br/>Sounds like a chore to me.  I'd like to do better than that.<br/><br/>Can you think of a good way to embed AW-style moves in a game where it's obvious to everyone that the talking is what really gets things done?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a>,<br/>1. For this thread, I think we should assume good adventure design, or good ad-lib.  The problem is not one of roadblocks, it's of failing to proceed (whether to successes or dead-ends) in an enjoyable and coherent fashion.  Even if players have no trouble finding another avenue to pursue, they still don't like feeling disoriented by avenue # 1.<br/><br/>"We saw an opportunity to assess something; we assessed it as best we could; our assessment failed, but we feel like we had a fair shot; on to the next thing," is just fine by me.  And it's certainly possible for social contract to get us there alone!  I've done that when GMing long campaigns.  But it'd be <i>super</i> sweet to do it with some game design I could share with others.<br/><br/>2. I think dead obvious clues would defeat the purpose.  No one gets to the edge of their seat over something that's supposed to be a cakewalk.  I think stylize etiquette might be a great <i>addition</i> to communicating via fiction, but it shouldn't <i>replace</i> it in terms of getting the job done.  Key phrases might be used to signal things like, "I'm done assessing, I'm committing to this approach now" or something.  Hmm.<br/><br/>3.  I am generally underwhelmed by advice and essays, but it sounds like Amber swordfighting was a big success!  Any thoughts on why it worked for you guys?  Do you recall any key ingredients that made it easy to remember and apply in the moment?<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440376/#Comment_440376" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-23T01:05:53+00:00" title="November 23, 2014  1:05AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2014 1:07AM by Rickard.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, here are some of the ways this play style can fail:</blockquote>\nCool, but you didn't address my question.

I wonder if something like that could work?  One factor could be the chosen Approach and the other could be the execution of that Approach.  So the GM is asking themself, "Was that the right strategy?" and also "Was it well executed?"  Which is pretty close to what the GM's asking themself already, but now you have a GM chart for the result.<br/><br/>What does that look like to the players?

So I will be vague and paint with large brushes and then we can delve deeper into some of the parts I'm talking about.<br/><br/>What if the game master suggested possible outcomes? So that the game master and the players interact with each other in a creative manner, and try to collaborate to advance the story?<br/><br/>This is what I think is "wrong" with the moves in AW. You don't need to roll, but the game master has instead moves that triggers if the players use a move. The game master's are additional possibilities of the players' moves. This will make the game run smoother but also create a natural way of communicate between the game master and the players, where the game master responds on the players' actions - and offering a new situation or changing the current situation as a response. This response is then up to the players to give a response back to.<br/><br/>That's something that I would feel would feel natural to use.

In fiction and on the screen (and in real life) what is the thing you see before the protagonist questions/ intimidates/ interrogates the clue carrying npc? You see (or get a description) of the clue carrying npc! The roll (if the system swings that way) is to read the npc. The PC then uses this information in a role playing scene as they attempt to use the NPC to achieve their goal.<br/>If the GM has a list of descriptive observations and the Player makes a social roll (or spends some points or however the game rules work), they get some portion of that list based on their success. The player then uses this to engage the target to win the clue. If they haven't deduced enough of these observations due to a poor roll they will have to figure it out during the conversation (roleplay).<br/>This means that social skills are observation and deduction skills. My high persuade skill doesn't mean that I have some mystical ability to influence people (unless that is exactly what it does!), it means that I am very good at reading people, reading their body language, interpreting how others react to them, how they dress, what they own, where they go and I therefore am able to present to them the exact interaction that will persuade them in my favour.<br/>If social skills are about what happens before the transaction then the transaction can be roleplayed. The dice, skill point spend (or whatever the game mechanics are) gives the player information that they use to impose their will in the social transaction. They can still fluff it but are less likely and don't have to rely on GM acting skills for the result. The roleplay of the transaction affirms the information they have deducted from observing the target and they feel as though they have had a meaningful encounter where character skill and player skill were both engaged.<br/><br/>This raises the question - why do many RPGs have lots of social skills? It doesn't make sense having intimidate and persuasion if they both draw on deductive observation of the target. I don't bother in my games. I use one skill to observe the target, it's up to the player what they do with the information. If you want to have more than one social skill you could justify them as representing the deductive part of the target shaping process. Eg: My Character has high intimidate skill and yours has high torture skill and we are watching an informer limping down the street. We see that he has experienced an injury to his left leg and he is clutching a paper bag to his chest. I would muscle up to him and demand to know the answer to my question, standing on his left foot and gradually applying pressure. You snatch the bottle out of his hand telling him that the only thing more painful than his leg is knowing that he will never get to drink this bottle, unless he speaks up.This example implies that intimidate is the threat of pain (physical or emotional), torture is the threat of loss of control (physical or emotional). <br/><br/>PS:- I work with some very effective sales people and this is pretty much how they operate. They can break down any social encounter into their goals and observations leading to a strategy that they deploy and modify if need be on the go. Have a chat with someone in sales or recruiting (who is good at it!) some time and they will tell you that most of the work is done before any words are said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440399/#Comment_440399" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-23T16:44:08+00:00" title="November 23, 2014  4:44PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2014 4:44PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way you make approach matter (as well as skills) is simply not to permit their use until they're performed.

In my experience, most players actually prefer explicit GM fiat over having a skill on their sheet which the GM can decide not to let them use based on communication via fiction.  It kinda defeats what numeric skills are for -- now it's nothing more than a second potential failure gate after the gate of GM approval.  Better to just have the GM say "Yes, it works!" with no roll.<br/><br/>That said, adding in rolls does help on the clarity front...  Maybe the GM determines Yes/No but then there's a roll for degree?<br/><br/>Brainstorm:\n<blockquote>GM has a white die and a black die.  Player has no dice.<br/><br/>GM roleplays NPC.  Player roleplays PC.  When GM thinks an Approach has been chosen and executed, GM picks up dice.  If player wasn't finished, they can interject; otherwise, they wait to see which die the GM hands them.<br/><br/>The GM hands the player one die.  Black die means failure, white die means success.  The die is then rolled, with low results meaning a moderate version (maybe a 1 Failure allows you to simply try again) and high results meaning an extreme version (on a 6 Failure, the NPC attacks you; on a 6 Success, the NPC tells you everything and is totally flexible about what they'll accept in return).</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440404/#Comment_440404" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-23T23:28:15+00:00" title="November 23, 2014 11:28PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines">@Matt_Haines</a>, that is awesome.

The distance the GM places these from where his/her hands naturally rest will hint at the "distance" to achieve a positive (green) or negative (red) outcome.<br/><br/>As the Player and GM talk, the GM moves a hand towards a token to silently indicate how the PCs are socially-reading the NPCs.<br/><br/>Perhaps an initial die roll would determine how accurately this movement happens (a la Matt_Haines - character sheet social skills are more genuinely accuracy about social reading).<br/><br/>Sometimes have a third token of a third color to represent an outcome not easily described as "success" or "failure".  (No, ma'am, we really do not want you to join our investigation.  Please let us escort you to the safe house.)<br/><br/>Sometimes have multiple green or red tokens, if the PCs clearly understand there are multiple successful or failing outcomes.  (Not only does he refuse to answer your questions, he draws a knife...)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It's a bit clunky.  But if the GM and Players do not have enough social skill themselves to make plain dialogue reliable, it is a crutch that at least allows everyone to be focusing properly on the conversation as it happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440415/#Comment_440415" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T04:36:00+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  4:36AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think the issue with D&amp;D3's Diplomacy is that people think it should do more than it does - people think it means "I persuade you that I'm right" instead of "What I say makes you have a Helpful attitude towards me". (This is despite what the rules say, not because of what the rules say.)  <br/><br/>So like, persuading the guy that you're right, there's no systemic way in D&amp;D to do that, either you convince the guy by roleplaying and the GM roleplaying, or you don't, and 1) this doesn't matter, and 2) this is good design.  Because D&amp;D3 is a fantasy adventure game about overcoming adventuresome challenges, so the only thing that matters is whether a person is hostile (a challenge), unfriendly (an enhancement to another challenge), friendly (provides assistance with another challenge) or helpful (will directly help you overcome a challenge).  Within those categories, they can think you're full of shit, an evil bastard, a raving monster, or a perfect saint, and it literally doesn't matter. "Oh my god, this guy is a horrible cruel vicious SOB, we better help him" is absolutely fine as a successful Diplomacy result.<br/><br/>I now actually think I'm going to have to look directly at social systems because I frankly can't think of ANY off the top of my head that operate in the space where "reading the GM's mind" actually is a problem.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines" title="Matt_Haines"><img alt="Matt_Haines" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/705/nML63TE0KV6AD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines">Matt_Haines</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440416/#Comment_440416" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T04:37:45+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  4:37AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a><br/>This works so well for D&amp;D because it is a game with a heroic narrative.

The fact that everyone will fold to the PCs is... Inevitable. Also, everything in these stories is conflict driven and the PCs are the conflict event horizons within their story- everyone else's priorities will be drawn to the singularity.<br/>This is awesome and advisable if you want to make or play a heroic game.

I would describe this as 'the Vincent Baker method', from playing the town in Dogs through the bit about how NPC motivations in AW are simple and obvious and most importantly of all <i>basically transparent</i> to the players.<br/><br/>Like, there is a huge gap between 'communicate via the fiction' and 'communicate via direct dialogue, the GM's actorly ability, and description of character action', which is actually what is happening in the first example. 'The fiction' of the game includes things like 'it's obvious to you that he is scared', after all -- that's a statement about the fiction. It could even include a whole interior monologue from the point of view of the NPC. The GM is free to share absolutely everything she knows about the fiction of the scene, and that would still be communication 'via the fiction'.<br/><br/>Similarly, the players could say things like 'my steely look of determination makes it clear that we are going to deal with this Alley Stalker once and for all.' They don't have to convey that through acting, they can just say it out loud, as narration. And that's 100% part of the fiction. It also makes their intent ultra-clear, much in the same way the GM making the NPC's fear more transparent makes the obstacles to the interaction more clear than just hoping she can get that across with her nascent acting chops.<br/><br/>So yeah, this is obviously about reducing the need for mind-reading, but based on the OP it seems like the actual mind-reading thing is not really what is being discussed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440419/#Comment_440419" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T07:58:47+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  7:58AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2014 8:03AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ICE, yeah, "Here, I'm giving you the vital info that you need," is definitely speech that gets everyone's attention!  Same with, "Having parsed that info, here's how I act on it."  I like playing this way!  It might be appropriate for the majority of scenes.<br/><br/>I also want other scenes, though, where the situation is <i>not</i> obvious to the characters, and none of the players or GM are allowed to simply resolve that uncertainty without struggle.  So, I guess this thread is about <i>those</i> scenes.  "Communicating via <i>non-obvious</i> fiction" is the challenge.  Thanks for helping me refine that description!<br/><br/>The scared dude in the alley may not be the best example, if it's not apparent why a little uncertainty would be fun there.  Maybe a frenemy NPC imperfectly attempting deception would be better.<br/><br/>Note: some historical frustration with this play style may stem from doing it compulsively, including in scenes which don't deserve it.  I think that's yet another dimension where having a formal system, which the group must consciously choose to engage or not, might help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440421/#Comment_440421" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T08:12:19+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  8:12AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2014 8:13AM by AsIf.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno man, even when you say it in a way you think is particularly pensive or pressured or subtly hinting or whatever, there's a good chance your players won't hear it that way.  Likewise you can say something you think is relatively innocuous and they take it like an auspicious sign and run with it.<br/><br/>And that's part of the fun.<br/><br/>Since we know both of the above are going to occur, and since we know we're not <i>really</i> talking about game mechanics enabling telepathy, this seems a pretty good way to go.  You said "uncertainty" above.  Well, one of the best ways to retain Uncertainty is for the GM to not know <i>themselves</i> what's being said.  I might say something, perhaps deliberately in a "weird way", perhaps not.  But you <i>hear</i> something in it, or you <i>think</i> you hear something in it, and you say something or ask a question.  Maybe you think he sounds scared, and you say "He sounds like he's gonna pee his pants any second, huh?"<br/><br/>Well guess what, I actually wasn't going for fear, I was trying to sound like a junkie.  But hey - now that you mention it...  That's not a bad way to go.  Someone rolls dice.  Depending on the playstyle and system it might be me, or it might be you.  Maybe there's a skill name for it.  If the system has no mechanic I roll a binary tree.  "Is it what Dave just suggested?"  Dice say yes.  Holy shit, that's cool, now I just need to make up a reason <i>why</i> this guy is so scared.

I mean, if I say the guy is scared, that doesn't tell the players why -- they have to figure out why he's scared, and how to react appropriately. Same if I point out that an NPC is acting suspicious. It simply ensures that the players know at least <i>that much</i>, whatever 'that' is.<br/><br/>In any case you still have a much wider variety of description available, while still remaining focused on 'non-obvious fiction.' GMs and players who limit themselves entirely to emotive dialogue/acting are going to have more trouble communicating <i>even non-obviously</i>, as it were. And some players are going to have an easier time playing this guessing-game when given cues through other means. Since the goal presumably has to be finding a descriptive sweet spot -- where things are not obvious, but they are also not completely unclear -- it is going to be easier if more modes of description are on the table.<br/><br/>This is mostly what I was hoping to point out. You have a stated preference for acting and voices and the like, but that's not the only way to communicate via the fiction, whether your goal is obvious or non-obvious communication.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440432/#Comment_440432" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T15:47:33+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  3:47PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: I don't get why you talk about communicating via fiction when the only thing you seems interested in is to solve this out of fiction via game mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440434/#Comment_440434" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T16:23:28+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  4:23PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooh, oooh, I know the answer to that one!

Rules exists to frame interaction between participants. When we talk to each other, we still use a structure otherwise we couldn't have a discussion over a forum.<br/><br/>So, a ruleset for interaction is a structure for communication but a structure for communication can be something else too. Having a debate follows a structure formed by those ancient Greeks that we constantly hear about.<br/><br/>COMBATANT A: first argument.<br/>COMBATANT B: first argument.<br/><br/>COMBATANT A: development and counter-argument.<br/>COMBATANT B: development and counter-argument.<br/><br/>COMBATANT A: counter-argument and wrap-up.<br/>COMBATANT B: counter-argument and wrap-up.<br/><br/>This is then sprinkled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion" rel="nofollow">ethos, pathos, logos</a>. This is an example of dialogue based structure for communication. We don't have to make it as competitive as a debate though. This is what I mean with when I talked about the mindset, and what kind of mindset that trying to come up with "obstacles" can create. A competitive mindset. Competition also occurs when the player tries to beat something and having, for example, skill rolls adds another layer of competition because the player can fail.<br/><br/>What I suggest is instead a collaborative mindset, where you create an interaction between the game master and the players to make the story progress. It doesn't matter if it's win or fail; it's playing to see where things are heading. Interaction is created through feedback loops, so create a structure where one participant create responses for another.<br/><br/>If we look at, not at WHAT a debate consist of, but HOW a debate is structured, we can see a purpose (winning an argument), a theme (the topic of the debate), a basic structure to involve each other, and how certain elements (ethos, pathos, logos) can be used to make the basic structure feel different from time to time.<br/><br/>Look at HOW the interaction occurs in <a href="http://improvencyclopedia.org/games/Presents.html" rel="nofollow">this little improv exercise</a>. They don't have points for it or dice rolls. They follow other kinds of structures. Don't look at WHAT they use though, but HOW they use it. What each element brings to this certain exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440438/#Comment_440438" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T17:22:00+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  5:22PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2014 5:38PM by Rickard.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Off topic thoughts</b><br/><br/>All this is also related to design-through-rewards.

But the point of view of the character is a literary/communicative construct, and it does not have set boundaries. It has enormously mutable boundaries constantly being negotiated between the players of the game. How this point of view is conveyed is just as mutable, as reading any number of novels or looking at any number of story games should hopefully confirm.<br/><br/>Anyways, maybe this is beyond the scope of the original request. But if you want to achieve this goal without relying on people to 'hone their acting and people-reading skills', it seems like you are best off stepping outside the standard modes of 'in-character' interaction. And if you want to do that while still maintaining focus on the fiction, then the first and most obvious place to step <i>to</i> is the space immediately surrounding those modes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440440/#Comment_440440" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-24T17:28:47+00:00" title="November 24, 2014  5:28PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2014 5:29PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, maybe the way to do the thing in the OP is just to say "in this game I try to portray characters as clearly as I can and you pay really close attention to what I'm doing and you try to respond accordingly."

Whenever I've gotten in a groove in this play style with a group, the <i>informal</i> rewards have <i>definitely</i> gone in both directions.  So something formal to help establish that groove might make sense.<br/><br/>I wonder if some manner of "I think I know where you're going with this!" would suffice.  Either say it as a ritual phrase, or pass a "Scared" card once you deduce the NPC is scared, or award the GM a token, or something.

And if I didn't think game mechanics could do that sort of thing, I'd only play freeform RPGs.</blockquote>\nThe thing is: all of your examples of play in the OP is about the game master throwing in an obstacle: the person is hesitant to give away information. I guess you did that to make things "interesting" by creating an uncertainty if the task would succeed or fail.<br/><br/>How about turning this around? All the examples assumes that the player wants to get the information, so how about having a structure for getting information out of someone? It can be called Getting Information Out of Someone.<br/><br/><b>Getting Information Out of Someone</b><br/>REQUIREMENT: The player must know or make up any fact that ties the target to the relevant information.<br/>REQUIREMENT: The player must impose that fact to the target.<br/>RESPONSES: (pick one or two)<br/>- The target actually doesn't know anything about it (the imposed fact was false).<br/>- The target can give pointers to someone who knows more about it.<br/>- The target is hesitant and needs a promise or favor from the player.<br/>- The target will exchange the information for items or money.<br/>- The target sees the good in revealing the information.<br/><br/>This can still create an obstacle but it's something that will occur through the use of an interaction model. You can sprinkle this with emotions, like anger, nervousness, relief and so on. You can add flavor to it by having the participants including one or two personality traits. You can even tell them to talk in a certain way, like having them go through the How to Introduce Yourself structure first. All these can come as requirements.<br/><br/>You can have structures within structures, like one structure called Using Structures that explains ... well ... how a participant should communicate when using a structure. You can have structures that triggers other structures. The example above could, for example, be cut into two structures. One that starting the structure and one that responds to it.

It sends a clear message of what the player wants to do by saying the name of the structure.<br/>2. It gives a clear understanding of how the process should look like.<br/>3. It creates an interaction between two people by invoking responses.<br/>4. By knowing the responses, or at least part of them, the "mind reading" will become more apparent.<br/>5. It gives guidance to what we should talk about in this specific moment.<br/>6. It changes every time because of what you sprinkle on top of the structure. Not so much changes in the straight-forward process, but what it looks like.<br/>7. It doesn't have to be about creating obstacles but it's instead about moving forward together.<br/><br/>This is what moves does in AW, but for some obscure reason, it got dice rolling in it. And people think that's good game design! A tradition that game designers should use when they create a roleplaying game. I would even go so far to say that people that played <b>Sorcerer, AW, Burning Wheels, Primetime Adventures</b> and <b>FATE </b> (among others) are brain-damaged because of that, to use a fairly well-known reference.<br/><br/>Seriously though, Forge-games and traditional games doesn't have that much differences rules-wise. They still do the same things (obstacles + dice rolling): it only looks different. And because of this, people have a hard time looking beyond what these basic core mechanisms really does. They are blinded by the WHAT it looks like instead of looking at HOW it's done.<br/><br/>Or at least that's what I can see in threads like this.<br/><br/>I can see the exact same trouble on rpg.net, where people argue about rolling 2d10 or 1d20 when it does the same fricking thing (obstacles + dice rolling). It only looks different. (This is also why I say that AW is traditional gaming seen from a different perspective. Vincent Baker got some really good ideas but he's still stuck in the traditional stream of how to design, and write, a roleplaying game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440465/#Comment_440465" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-25T08:05:41+00:00" title="November 25, 2014  8:05AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2014 8:11AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I disagree with you regarding the value of obstacles.

In the most trusted and intimate interactions we communicate without speaking. Do we get that intimate in a game with friends? Probably not but building trust in that direction will get you what you want. Can rules do this? Yes, but maybe it is about building the basis for deep trust in communication rather than focusing on the communication itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

more than it does - people think it means "I persuade you that I'm right" instead of "What I say makes you have a Helpful attitude towards me". (This is despite what the rules say, not because of what the rules say.)  <br/><br/>So like, persuading the guy that you're right, there's no systemic way in D&amp;D to do that, either you convince the guy by roleplaying and the GM roleplaying, or you don't, and 1) this doesn't matter, and 2) this is good design.  Because D&amp;D3 is a fantasy adventure game about overcoming adventuresome challenges, so the only thing that matters is whether a person is hostile (a challenge), unfriendly (an enhancement to another challenge), friendly (provides assistance with another challenge) or helpful (will directly help you overcome a challenge).  Within those categories, they can think you're full of shit, an evil bastard, a raving monster, or a perfect saint, and it literally doesn't matter. "Oh my god, this guy is a horrible cruel vicious SOB, we better help him" is absolutely fine as a successful Diplomacy result.<br/><br/>I now actually think I'm going to have to look directly at social systems because I frankly can't think of ANY off the top of my head that operate in the space where "reading the GM's mind" actually is a problem.  </blockquote>\nIt is funny how the diplomacy skill has taken on a life of its own. I've been in a number of debates on the social skills in D&amp;D topic and always go back to the text when it arises. It has been a little while since I've looked at it, but I seem to recall the Diplomacy skill essentially just works with the reaction adjustment tables. It really isn't the Diplomancer nightmare people sometimes make it out to be. However I also do recall that the social skill descriptions at times suggest it can do more than create a helpful attitude in the examples they use and stuff (but I could be wrong here). One approach to social skills I kind of like is what they did in 2E, where Etiquette was a knowledge skill. You didn't make the skill as an action, rather you used it to see what you knew about the appropriate behaviors for a given situation. For me this reduces any potential confusion between the rolling and the roleplaying (something I realize not everyone has a problem with, but I just have this mental difficulty where I am constantly getting confused the more social skill rolls intrude into what the players themselves are saying in character). That said, most of the people I know like some kind of social skill rolls to be in games, so even I use them in the games i make (and my way of evading the confusion is to only call for a social skill roll when there is doubt or uncertainty in my mind about how an NPC would react to what a player does or says).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440474/#Comment_440474" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-25T16:22:33+00:00" title="November 25, 2014  4:22PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not wrong to have a successful Diplomacy roll be described, fictionally, by "yeah, you're right, you've convinced me, I'll help you", and it's often fine to treat it that way, but only the last three words are set in stone by the system.<br/><br/>That's cool about Etiquette. I actually think that brings up an interesting thing about David's question/goal, which is that there are actually two things at work in most of the examples we've talked about so far:<br/><br/>1 - Does the GM get across the information? Do the players know what the GM is trying to portray?<br/><br/>But there's a second part to it too:<br/><br/>2 - Do the players know what that means about their options? Frankly, I've played characters who, when determining that an NPC was scared, would be MORE likely to be intimidating rather than comforting, because from their perspective (and sometimes mine), it's easier to successfully intimidate scared people; you know for a fact it will work.  If someone took the position that the GM did in David's example, that being scared was an absolute bar to intimidation coercing someone, that's actually not something that can be portrayed because it's a philosophical (or psychological) statement about the world. It's fine if that's true (we make political, psychological and philosophical statements about the world we portray constantly), but it's not acting that will get that across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440476/#Comment_440476" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-25T17:18:12+00:00" title="November 25, 2014  5:18PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Cool. That's a... Bold statement. <br/>When you say you want rules, do you mean RPG mechanics or do you mean strategies, or a series of comparable metrics, all of the above or something altogether different?<br/>The reason why I ask is because what it seems to me you want is a way of reliably achieving and retaining a flow state and what you need to do that is Trust.<br/>If there is a deep investment in trust shared between the participants the intrinsic capacity for nuanced communication at all levels increases. In the most trusted and intimate interactions we communicate without speaking. Do we get that intimate in a game with friends? Probably not but building trust in that direction will get you what you want. Can rules do this? Yes, but maybe it is about building the basis for deep trust in communication rather than focusing on the communication itself.</blockquote>\nThis. So true.

"If you want to buy Improved Seduction, you need to spend 10 XP."  "On your turn, you must draw an Approach card."  "A retcon takes a majority vote."  "Two players can swap hands if they both agree."  "Roll 2d6 to resolve Persuasion attempts."  "First player to reduce their opponent's Dialogue Points to zero wins."  "No talking out of character."  "Speak only in questions."<br/><br/>Sure, rules that successfully built a basis for the right type of trust could help!  My experience suggests that that's not the whole story, though.  Playing out scenes in totally freeform fashion has some vulnerabilities ("Did we fail?  Did we make progress?  Should we try again?  I can't tell!") regardless of trust level.<br/><br/>My experience also suggests that people who show up to roleplay an urban espionage adventure will resist spending a chunk of their evening on trust-building exercises.  So I'd recommend that any such procedures be incorporated into play somehow, or be extremely fun and efficient otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440479/#Comment_440479" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-25T20:02:48+00:00" title="November 25, 2014  8:02PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2014 8:05PM by Rickard.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your definition  of "freeform" seems weird.

What do you want to talk about during the session (what is \xbbplay\xab about?), and WHY should anyone want to talk about that?<br/><br/>I'm asking about theme and purpose of playing that theme now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440486/#Comment_440486" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-25T22:38:16+00:00" title="November 25, 2014 10:38PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2014 10:39PM by WarriorMonk.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David. I've got an answer to your problem. Note here that I'm saying "an answer" and not "the answer". I'm pointing this out because it's something that just recently started to work for me, required me to change my way of thinking about GMing and it mostly works with a specific playstyle. But I can assure that for all the hardship all these requirements may present, the results are really worthy.<br/><br/>What I'm doing is nothing new; it comes from playing a hack I made of AW after misunderstanding AW really hard. Also, it looks like something taken from "Play Unsafe" and while in play it may look as a heavy GM-fiat game with lots of freeform, the actual truth is that there's a procedure that guides the whole thing solidly into flow.<br/><br/>And barely requires prep. Actually the main requirement is that the GM should go to the session mostly unprepared (at least in terms of pre-making NPCs, motives or anything secret that the players must/will have to/will unveil anyway in order to experience amazement, fear or anything created by the GM that she meants the players to experience. <br/><br/>Making no prep in this sense is actually an important part of the whole procedure. This may be enough to unnerve most perfectionist compulsive railroaders of GM (the whole concept unnerved me an shunned me away from games that boasted on this as their main feature) or it may be considered something really difficult to pull away by even the most accomplished improvisational freeformers. Once I misunderstood AW and tried playing it, it became not only possible but incredibly easy, as I found my mind was already trained to do this with the proper procedure in mind.<br/><br/>The procedure is basically this:<br/><br/>PREP<br/>-Made a simple AW hack, World of Dungeons alike but gave the players no moves at all. <br/>-outline of the setting (I used an anime called Sword Art Online. Only two players of our group of 7 were familiarized with it; we could have also brainstormed the setting right there)<br/>-bring together a few tools for random improvisation. (my own <a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/latest-version-of-the-resourcefull-deck/" rel="nofollow">resourcefull deck</a> a <a href="http://calicogames.com/order-short-order-heroes.html" rel="nofollow">short order heroes deck</a> for npc's and some other stuff alike that I'm still testing (but no random tables as these are better suited for making heavy prep and they usually stall a bit my playstyle) Tarot cards may work too if you known them well enough to interpretate them in the fly.<br/><br/>IN GAME<br/>-Gave the players the premise of the anime (you're playing in a virtual reality massive online game but the creator of the game removes the exit button of the system and now you have to end the game to get out. Oh, and if you die, your brain is fried in the real word)<br/>-Players say whatever they wanna do and I have them roll the dice against the usual AW target numbers. And here comes the second core part of the procedure: If they fail, things get interesting (I use what I half remember from all the regular and custom moves I've seen in every hack + my usual evil GM imagination), if they do better, they success in exchange of something as per the AW rules, if they roll really high they get what they want and more.<br/><br/>Now, how's is that different from regular AW or even related to the social confrontation? That's where I just use the random tools to make npcs and their reactions, but let the players decide on their motives to create the story after whatever they have understood/misunderstood. It's a bit tricky but doable to made up something based only on the PCs reactions; you can also totally mountain-witch them by asking what they think of the situation now and even make them roll if they guessed it correctly, if they may need more clues or proof to be sure, or if the actually guessed right but dismiss their thoughts as something not too important or too far-fetched.<br/><br/>AP looked like this:<br/>GM: You arrive to the first town; there's an Inn and a Blacksmith in town, besides of a small marketplace. (GM totally winging this, still hasn't anything prepared) What do you want to do?<br/>Player: I want to go to the blacksmith, see if he has weapons or armor.<br/>GM: You see this (Draws ten random cards with different weapons and armor) (drawing three cards from the SOH deck) The Blacksmith is a tall, confident and really strong guy (GM gets some ideas from this, but keeps it fro himself for the moment)<br/>(after players buy their stuff)<br/>Player: I also would like to learn how to repair or make weapons.<br/>GM: Great! Describe more of how you ask him about it and roll the dice<br/>Player: (either prefers to play his character as a simple guy or thinks he may win the blacksmith easier being confident and open) Hi, these are really good weapons! Would you mind teaching me how to repair or make my own? (rolls a 9)<br/>GM: (That means he can get it in exchange of something... great, this is a side-quest then! GM draws a card for inspiration and gets "daughter") The blacksmith changes his mood to a bit worried look and losing some of his confidence says "Well, my daughter and me had an argument this morning. Whenever she's upset, she goes to the forest, but then she hasn't come back yet and it's almost time for her to make lunch. If you are able to bring her back in a good mood, I'll teach you the basics"<br/><br/>At this point the flow on the table was so quick and good that a big part of the inspiration came by itself and without too much need for the cards. Well, I hope any of this helps. Ah, also, I finally made a couple of pages of a comic to explain the basics of my hack using the techniques we wrote long ago. It ended being a game well suited for begginers, but I still want to make a better one.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443128/#Comment_443128" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-23T07:09:34+00:00" title="February 23, 2015  7:09AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2015 7:12AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never got around to fully mining all the goodness offered in various responses, and I'm still not ready to do that now, but I did want to chime in with a new analysis:<br/><br/>Maybe we can take note, procedurally, of both <b>decisions</b> and <b>performances</b>.  Formal statements of "here's what I thought you were trying to do" (face-up card) and reveals of "here's what I was actually trying to do" (flipping over a previously-selected face-down card) could recognize analysis and choice, which would cover everything...<br/><br/>...except how <i>well</i> you executed your plan (as opposed to how <i>clearly</i>).  But perhaps once we get to the point where the GM knows the characters are attempting to offer the skittish NPC protection, and the players know that the GM knows that, then a simple judgment call of, "Yeah, I'm convinced, the NPC would go for that," could suffice?  In a smooth back-and-forth, that would render the formal procedures largely irrelevant... but since the rules are there largely for when it <i>isn't</i> smooth, maybe that's okay?  At least, as long as the procedures aren't a chore?<br/><br/>So, here:\n<blockquote>GM: (Decides NPC is scared.  Puts "scared" card face down.) <i>Well, sirs, I really would help you if I could</i> (wrings hands) <i>but I don't know anything about the Alley Stalker.</i> (looks down)<br/><br/>Player 1: Hmm.  Guys, I think he's not helping us because he's scared.  (Puts "scared" card face up, opposite GM's card.)  I know what to try.  (Shows the "promise safety" card to Player 2, who nods.  Puts "promise safety" face down.)  <i>I understand your position, but look, if we can find the Alley Stalker, we will take him down! Then no one will have anything more to fear from him.</i><br/><br/>GM: (Figures their intent is to "promise safety", so puts that card down, face up, opposite players' face-down card.  The GM plans to evaluate how well the players have done that.) </blockquote>\nWhen the GM's second card comes down, the GM must also flip the first card if it was guessed correctly.  \n<blockquote>GM: (Flips card, revealing that, yes indeed, the old man was "scared".  This is the moment when the PCs encounter no surprises in the NPC's response: as befits a scared old man, he offers the PCs a hopeful but skeptical expression.)</blockquote>\nIf the players had guessed wrong, the card would stay face-down and the NPC would do something new, as the GM would seek another way to reveal the true nature of the face-down card.\n<blockquote>Player 2: (Knowing that the GM has begun judging the players on how well they're promising safety.)  <i>We have a safe house. Give us something we can use, and we'll escort you there, to stay until this is all over.</i><br/><br/>GM: (Judging that this will convince the NPC.)  <i>You promise I'll be safe? Very well, then. Here's what I've seen...</i><br/><br/>Player 1: (Flips over "promise safety", an irrelevant move because the encounter is over.  However, if the GM had thought the PCs were trying something else, and they had not succeeded, then the card would have stayed face-down, and the players would have taken another stab at their actual aim.)</blockquote>\n\u2022 In the case of an NPC with multiple motives, the GM would put down additional face-down cards at any time when the GM attempted to reveal these additional motives.<br/><br/>\u2022 In the case of an NPC who is engaged in expert deception, the GM may play cards relating to the ruse rather than the truth, but should be open to putting the "deception" card face-down on the table (then to be signaled in roleplay) if the PCs do anything that might cause the NPC to slip (in the GM's judgment).  Once deception has been verified (players act on it, GM confirms), the players must then judge which previously-revealed cards to ignore (or perhaps they can take actions to test them).<br/><br/>\u2022 Note that just because the GM plops down a card does not mean the players <i>must</i> care about this NPC's aims and disposition.  Big enough bribes and credible enough threats can work on anyone, and the GM's job, ultimately, is still to judge, "Would that work?"<br/><br/>My hope with this system is that, because there would be plenty of different "motive" cards, and simply guessing at random would not get you to answers in any useful fashion, the players would in fact hang on the GM's every word in order to make their assessment; and the GM would do likewise, due to both the need for "does that work?" judgment and the plentitude of "tactic" cards.  Still, it might be good to bolster this effect with some sort of penalty for acting on incorrect assessments.  Maybe there are only so many card slots you can fill before the NPC does everything in their power to end the conversation.<br/><br/>There are probably holes in this, maybe major ones, but I just wanted to type it out as it came to me so I wouldn't forget.

This is one area where I was helped by Robin Laws' ideas, clearest expressed in Unframed. I have issues with social skills but his ideas about petitioner, granter, and tactics really helped me understand what was going on in the scenes, how to make them clearer and how to wrap them up.<br/><br/>I like his method here because it is very open-ended, you're not just choosing from a set menu of skills and cards.<br/><br/>His idea is that you first figure out who's asking whom for something in the scene. In this case, the PCs are the petitioners and the old man is the granter.<br/>Then you figure out (this is still inside the GM's brain): <br/>1. Does the old man have any reasons not to immediately give the PCs what they want? In this case yeah, he is scared of his life. That fear also influence his choice of tactics.<br/>2. What will he say and do in order to be left alone? He might express his fear clearly (appealing to the other's mercy), or he might attempt to be really convincing that he doesn't know anything about the alley stalker (using deception as a tactic).<br/><br/>Then, in the dialogue, the parties will keep on talking, switching tactics until one or both sides has gotten what they wanted, or until people just start repeating themselves.<br/><br/>Laws explains it better.<br/>In this case, maybe the old man does try to run away scared.<br/><br/>I had a frustrating moment as a player in a game last december with a dialogue scene that I thought went meandering nowhere (might just as well have been my fault). I just said: "Look, OOC: what I am trying to do is to make it come across to this guy that we're going to be honest to him. We interacted with the rebels but we reported it back to him. That's all. I'm not asking for anything else. Does he understand what I'm saying?"<br/>That solved it. Sometimes going OOC is the only solution <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19884/can-we-make-reading-the-gms-mind-more-reliably-fun" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19884/can-we-make-reading-the-gms-mind-more-reliably-fun" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19884/can-we-make-reading-the-gms-mind-more-reliably-fun/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19884%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19884%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
