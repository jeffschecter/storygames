I look in my ph@t Gen Con l00t bag and pull out Zombie Cinema.  So we play the hell out of some Zombie Cinema.<br/><br/>We set it in our town - Carrboro, North Carolina - tomorrow.  Our crew:<br/><br/>A hippie mom with a baby in a sling.  Useless!<br/>A Detroit cop in town to put his elderly mom in a retirement community.  Angry!<br/>Elderly mom.  Senile!<br/>A PTSD-wracked Iraq veteran.  Opportunist!<br/>His younger brother, with a soft heart and a broken shoulder.  Weakling!<br/><br/>This game works beautifully.  I think we were a little off our game - I'm getting over a cold, one guy had never played anything but D&amp;D - but the game totally worked.  I highly recommend using local landmarks to guide the first session!  We were all holed up in Weaver Street Market, then shot our way out and ended up barreling down Highway 54 and crashing into the Fiesta Grill out by White Cross.  It made it easy to frame scenes and deliciously fun to desecrate local businesses.  The game's mechanics relentlessly enforce Romero-like zombie tropes - we started with rumor and innuendo and ended up with crazy mobs of deadly zombies flipping pickup trucks.  And the escalation ensures that interpersonal conflicts have genuine weight.  At one point me (grandma) and Robo (the hippie mom) found ourselves in a situation with three posible outcomes:<br/><br/>1.  We both die.<br/>2.  Grandma shoves Hippie Mom out to survive.<br/>3.  Hippie Mom shoves Grandma out to survive.<br/><br/>Conflict!  Grandma loses, because <i>her own son </i>supported Hippie Mom!  Yaaaargh!  And best of all, I'm still in the game, now as the zombie hordes.  We had five players and out game lasted 80 minutes, which seems fast, but everybody enjoyed it.  No one survived.  The last survivor, the teenager with the broken shoulder, took pity on a whimpering dog that was infected and ate his face.  <br/><br/>This is my new A-1 pickup game, and my wife Autumn is now eager to try it out.  The procedural bits map brilliantly to any "looming chaos", so I can easily see repurposing the simple game to showcase, for example, a pandemic or the Iraq war.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163995/#Comment_163995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T07:49:42+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  7:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>or the Iraq war.</blockquote>\nEmily <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/jiffycon-recap/" rel="nofollow">beat you to the latter one</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164000/#Comment_164000" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T08:03:17+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  8:03AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It worked frighteningly well for the conflict in Iraq. One modification we made was to have each player choose a goal for their character. Things like "protect my men" for the one playing an American military officer. I chose "give a good graduation present to my son" for my Iraqi business man. In the first turn I had my character take part in smuggling in drugs for black market medical purposes, and got caught by at a check point by the officer. <br/><br/>And my experience has also been that it works great for pick up play. From Zombies on the Love Boat to Walmart when a must-have electrical gadget was just about to debut.  What you have in the setting, plus the zombies makes for super fun tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164003/#Comment_164003" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T08:10:56+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  8:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We talked at Gen Con, Jonathan!  <br/><br/>I want to write some ZC-structured "serious games" in the worst way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164017/#Comment_164017" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T08:51:03+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  8:51AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, Jason.

I've had a very busy summer because of Gencon - I basically had to priorize the projects that justified going to Gencon at all, which is why I haven't worked more on what we outlined in the winter.<br/><br/>That's a long-winded way of saying that as far as I'm concerned, making up some variant versions is still a very current notion! Feel free to work up your own ideas, or wait for me to come back to Day in a War sometime next month, when I return up north to my office.
