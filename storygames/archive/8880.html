You get relationship-point(?) and by using them you get to challenge, either for better or worse, a relationship between two parties. This challenge happens at the beginning of a session and from that point it come to happen into fiction.<br/><br/>This is just an ambiguous idea. some obvious question we have not jet answered are. <br/><br/>Do you get to challenge relationships between two parties your character has no influence over? <br/><br/>Is the character actively challenging the relationships or does this happen just by changing the setting?<br/><br/>So yeah... I have to guess there must be some similar systems out there, I'm really new to the whole story-games scene, so I don't jet know &gt;.&lt;<br/><br/>Any advice? anything you know works similarly or completely the same?</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196376/#Comment_196376" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T03:18:45+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  3:18AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2009 3:21AM by GB_Steve.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hot War attaches numbers to relationships and has a method for changing them, It's Complicated creates relationships but without the use of any numbers (and very elegantly too).<br/><br/>Koenig Hospital uses different colours on a relationship map to indicate whether relationships are positive or negative, and arrows to indicate direction. The dice indicate whether these can be change in a scene. I will need to change this though, because I wrote the game for someone before I knew he was colourblind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196406/#Comment_196406" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T10:32:35+00:00" title="March 10, 2009 10:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also check out my game in playtest, <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/" rel="nofollow">Verge</a>, which is all about a giant network (sorta like an r-map) of stuff in the setting, and each thing and each relationship is numerically rated. The game is ALL about changing the network.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
