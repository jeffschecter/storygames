                    Note: The following is me unabashedly wrapping my SG security blanket around myself.<br/><br/>In another forum, someone posted this during a discussion of evaluating combat effectiveness a la D&amp;D's CR system (for a system which lacks similar). The guy is essentially arguing that there's no point to a formal system, and that it may not even be possible for the system we weer discussing.
<blockquote>Here's the real truth -- any such mechanic is just a tool, and like all tools its true value is only realized in the hands of someone that knows what they are doing and / or have talent to begin with. A very good tool can compensate for its user's deficiencies, but a true master will always be capable of a much more nuanced and virtuoso performance than a hack with a tool.</blockquote>
"True master"? This quote made me want to punch the guy in the nose, and I'm not even entirely sure why. Am I crazy?                </div>

                            Ok, what he says is true in general, but is also a failure of metaphor.  Tools have a quality - how well they're made - but they also have a type - what they're designed to do.  He is pretty clearly confusing the two.<br/><br/>To illustrate this divide, by his logic, a Master Craftsman should be able to drive a nail with a screwdriver better than I could with a hammer.  It's not the tool, after all.<br/><br/>Now, the problem here is that he has very clearly reached _some_ level of understanding.  To hit upon the idea that All tools are just tools and the final effort is an expression of the wielder is one of those things that hits like a flash of insight when it comes to you and, like most layered thinking, seems like the truth that other people just don't understand for a while.<br/><br/>I wouldn't sweat his zealotry, or even his implicit understanding that he is, of course, one of the virtuosos.  He's taken a step, and he's looking around at the thousands of crappy tools around him, and can't tell the difference between the ones that are just there and the ones that will really help him, and that discovery can't be forced, but in time, he may see that the tools are the craftsman partner, not his bitch.<br/><br/>Or maybe he won't.  Wouldn't be the first time. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Nah.  You should cockpunch him.<br/><br/>He has a point in that almost all systems like D&amp;D's Challenge Rating system are going to have some flaws and places where it breaks down to a certain extent.  This is especially true in a game that has a complex combat resolution system like D&amp;D.  There are just too many variables to keep up with to get the CR perfect for all possible encounters.<br/><br/>However, he's also an idiot if he thinks a tool is useless just because it has limitations.  It's there to help as a guideline and a "true master" would find a way to use the system to help himself.  The judge of the tool's usefulness isn't whether or not it will make a newbie GM perform to the level of a GM with vast experience.  It's whether it can make the game prep easier and more efficient for both the newbie GM and the GM with vast experience.  As a GM with quite a bit of D&amp;D experience, the CR system and those like it help.  They don't replace personal judgement calls but they sure do aid them.                        </div>

I guess so. Or that "great GMs" are born, not made. Like providing, you know, clear instructions is something for "hobbyist gamers," and us <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7521044027821122670" rel="nofollow">"elite gamers"</a> don't need it.                        </div>

                            One of these days, I will be a True Master and able to do the Crane Kick at the table. Nothing will stop me. <br><br>Like he says, mechanics are tools, or set of tools combined into a package called A Game. Some tools make some jobs easier, more reliable, more predictable or something else. Some tools look like a hammer, but then you find out that they're made out of rubber. There are plenty of good tools and bad tools, though there aren't tools for every possible job. At least, not yet.<br/><br/>Tools are also set procedures that work in certain ways. Humans are not; they are flexible and adaptable, in both good and bad sense of the words.<br/><br/>So, yes - human actions produce a more nuanced performance and wider results, both worse and better than tools. There are no True Masters; there probably are committed craftsmen with limited range of specialties. If want new furniture, tools are like Ikea - you can buy a full package or mix and match for pre-made items, which are delivered to you complete with instructions on how to set things up, and necessary equipment. The human equivlaent, on the other hand, goes to buy wood and takes them to his craft shop, where he meticuously crafts a chair or something. It takes longer and  it's harder, but the result could or could not be exactly what he wants, depending on his craftmanship. Or he could just go, get a log, and call it a chair. <br/><br/>And so on. If it's a System Doesen't Matter -thing, then it's that only in scope of actual mechanics.                        </br></br></div>

I think the CR system is ok, but it's not really any better than any of the charts that D&amp;D has always had telling you what "Level" various monsters are appropriate for.                        </div>

You're absolutely right, Dev. That's why I've been restraining myself from posting additional "And then he said... to which I said..." I was just looking for a sanity check.<br><br/>Similar to comments in the "Hippie Gamers, what old-skool games can you still enjoy?" and similar threads, I find myself having a hard time participating in some of the old-skool/mainstream forums I frequent, now that I've drunk of the indie juice. I'll say something that I think makes sense to my reeducated self ("This game could use some tools for building scenarios"), and then I'll get responses that just make my head explode ("Omega-level Dungeon Masters don't need tools").                        </br></div>

                            Actually, "you need a great GM" is not saying system doesn't matter. Because system is what we do at the table to decide what happens, not the material in the book.

One thing to point out though, is that there are no mechanics w/r/t the topic in the book we were discussing. This is his response to my suggestion that it'd be really helpful if the company would publish said mechanics/guidelines.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that he's not alone. More than a few people in the thread basically said that mastering the system is the only way to accomplish the goal, ergo there's no point in the publisher providing tools towards the goal. This is what I find bizarre.                        </div>

                            Buzz, <br/><br/>That's probably because in such games all those people already have a system. It's a system that works for them. (At least for the GM.) So why would they want a new system when the one they have already works? <br/><br/>As for it being the only way, well... for a lot of people historically it has been. And at this point there is a lot of pride, power, and self-value embedded in it. So it isn't any surprise they overreact to it. Thus the "I AM GOD" part of the argument, which is clearly wrong.                        </div>

My personal reading of the quote doesn't see anything "slimy" in her praise but I might be missing something about the context.

<p>There are two GM skills: creating of really sweet fiction, and also handling the social negotation and cues of all your players. New game rules can modify this to varying degrees, but even in games without a formal GM, someone in this role - particularly the social negotiation - can be very empowering for everyone else.</p>

                            I'm not even sure the guy is saying "I AM GOD"--I mean, he might mean it--but he's not saying he is there (that I can see). Also: I kind of agree him in a sense--most of the rules that govern GM-created adversity limit the GM. In the case of a GM who is highly skilled in providing adversity for a specific group in a particular set of circumstances, those limits (if they are limits and not just guidelines, anyway) can be a drawback: There may be *some* case where providing adversity above the stated limits (or below) is a net-better experience for the group than the rule suggests. And the hypothetical "good GM" could certainly know that.<br/><br/>Also: He doesn't say (in that quote) whether a virtuoso GM with a tool is better than a virtuoso GM without a tool (like get two master musicians on stage and give one of them a poor instrument to play with and see who sounds better)--of course he might say that a virtuoso GM will never need a tool at all, which I wouldn't agree with as a blanket statement.<br/><br/>I also think that coming to SG for a security blanket and quoting other people in an argument where there can be sort of a questionable virtual dog-pile (he isn't saying System Doesn't Matter, as Brand points out) isn't something I'd advise doing.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

I don't think he is either. That was me with my tongue in my cheek, for the record.

My sentiments in the area are around the "its easier to have a group that all works together" combined with a "no surprise for the GM, no fun in the game" issue. (Thus my problem in that situation wouldn't be that I felt dirty, I wouldn't. I'd feel bored.) I've never once had a problem with players telling me they thought I rocked as a GM or saying I had them riveted. I've had people say the same things to me as a player, so it seems a bit reactionary. <br/><br/>But then I've also never had a problem being an authority figure either. I've only had a problem being a figure of false authority or abuse of authority. All of which are different issues.<br/><br/>Now that you've explained it better, it makes more sense. But your initial statement sounded much more reactionary than your current one.<br/><br/>Also, what happened to your avatar? It's vanished on my screen.                        </div>

                            I've got no problem with performing, and getting an honest appraisal of performance. I've okay with acting and public speaking.

                            One more thing to add: a couple of years later, I ran a game for two non-gamers. Afterwards the comments were more "<i>That</i> was amazing." <br/><br/>Reflecting on the game, one person said "So you just sort of smooth it all out and tell us when to roll."<br/><br/>That was satisfying.

Yes, granted, some games work better than others do (sic). But still, <i>people do matter</i>. A coherent group of sensitive, creative, skilled players are a better warranty for fun than the best game system imaginable.<br/>

I find this relevant to what I was getting at in this thread, misguided as I may have been. Basically, my issue is the disdain for "people who are just people" I saw in the guy's tone. "A tool is only going to be of use to them, so why bother?" was what I was reading. I may have been wrong.                        </div>
