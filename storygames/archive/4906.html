In the US, a rapist is statistically guaranteed to never be punished for his first bite at the rape-apple.  On the Internet, predators hunt for victims.  On street corners, people sell powders and pills that rot lives.  On the highway, every tailpipe incrementally shortens the lifespan of the human species by slowly but inexorably fouling the world.  People stand in line at the coffee house, and talk on the cellphones, and judge and hate those around them in a bored compulsive way.  The world is so shitty and filthy and full of hate and badness that the Angels can't stand to walk in it.  They roost in their clean pure aethers , and they watch and they weep.  They weep constantly, and sometimes their tears fall into the eyes of someone looking heavenwards and screaming for help or for answers.  "Why?  Why do you let this evil continue?"  And the Angels say, "We're so so sorry, but you stink, and we just can't stand the smell."<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes, someone hears the weeping, and through them the Angels decide to do something about the world.  Guided by the excited voices filling their head, aided by the tear-streaked graces fallen from heaven, they walk lonely roads and bring peace, and justice, and love... and they fight the Monsters too.  You can't forget the monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE WORLD ISN'T FUCKED UP ENOUGH FOR DEMONS...  in 2006, Americans gave over 300 billion in charitable gifts, and some of it was genuine and heartfelt.  People still crave connection to other people.  They still want love.  Fathers help their children up, and kiss their skinned knees better.  Mothers wash soap from their eyes at bathtime.  Hard-working police and firefighters and EMT's save lives, and bring hope.  Teachers teach.  Preachers preach.  Kids laugh and play.  On the way to work this morning, someone let someone else out in front of them in traffic, and that started a chain of kindness which will touch a hundred thousand people by the end of the year.  A million tiny acts of kindness are fireflies in the darkness, blinking on and off in an instant, but lighting the night.  And every one, a stab of pain in the eyes of the Demons.  They can't stand the light, and the hope, and the love.  They crouch in their pit, wallowing in their own filth, moaning and hating and hungering for all the pretty little people.  They look upwards, and they want to be there so so bad, but they just can't so they scream in the darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes, someone hears the screams, and through them the Demons decide to do something about the world.  Guided by the visions filling their heads, aided by the flesh-twisting horrors bubbling up from the pits, they walk the lonely roads and bring pestilence and ruin and corruption... and slowly they warp and twist and become Monsters too.  You can't forget the monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT WHATEVER THE WORLD IS, IT'S COMPLICATED...  sometimes, someone hears Angels and sees Demons.  The grace comes to them, and guides them, and fortune smiles wide when the teeth of demons snaps closed around them, missing by a flywing breadth.  But also, the horror makes their limbs move like pistons, fingers like knives, and their breath is ghostwind and their hair is twined with holly and brier and hooks sad slowly under bad man's eyelids.  And between the noise of Heaven, and the art of Hell, they walk the long highways of America's backcountry , scrounging, squatting, and finding some way to live with the swirling darkness and the screaming light, dodging Saints, and killing Monsters, and trying to stay alive and more importantly , trying to stay who they think they really are, down inside, where the voices can't be heard and the sights can't be seen, down in their heart of hearts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the deal...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110004/#Comment_110004" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T09:41:35+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  9:41AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a non-commercial testbed project for me to play with some ideas that have recently been nibbling at me.

For example, being cast as the 'Heel' means in some way, you're the bastard.  Being cast as the 'Patsy' means you're going to have to take one for the team.  Being cast as the 'Hero' means you get to kick ass and be awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for this post, I want to zero right in on the conflict rez scheme and the way it partially yoinks player choice... hopefully in a cool and exciting and story+ way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm using a bare-bones version of the ORE dice mechanic.  That's a pool of d10's rolled and self-referenced for matches.  Width is the number of dice in the set, Height is the value shown on the dice.  Normally, Width gets you speed/power, and Height gets you quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, Width says whether you get the negotiated stakes/goals decided on when the conflict is declared, and Height says which of your three Natures manifests when you throw yourself into the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nWidth is read like so:<br/>\nNo Match-  NO<br/>\nWidth 2-   YES, BUT<br/>\nWidth 3-   YES<br/>\nWidth 4+  YES, AND<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters have three scores governing how good they are at a particular mode of conflict- TALK, THINK, DO (basically, social, mental, physical).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Devil Boy has TALK 6d, THINK 4d, and DO 5d</b><br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters have three Natures showing how much of themselves has been taken over by the demonic or the angelic (HORROR, EGO, GRACE).  These have ranges totaling 1-10.  HORROR on the low end, GRACE on the high end, and EGO in the middle.  There's some fiddly bits for each, but for right now just consider that each has a general description and one focused on each of the three conflict types.  If these can be applied to a scene, there will be a payoff to using them in the narration, otherwise they are color.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Devil Boy has HORROR 1-5, EGO 6-8, GRACE 9-10  </b><br/>\n<b>HORROR</b>... His eyes are windows to a frozen blue hell, and he can open those windows.  His gaze brings gut-shaking terror, shows him the weakest link, and how to break it, and if opened wide, freezes, cracks, shatters, and leaves a rime of hoarfrost on everything.<br/>\n<b>EGO</b>... He's like a young Clint Eastwood- especially in his own mind- laconic, ironic, and squinty.  He talks slooooow and easy, calming and reassuring.  He's a lousy planner, but good at improvisation.  He's lanky and quick, but he's more enduring than evasive- tough as cured leather.<br/>\n<b>GRACE</b>... Its like he's remembering it all from a dream... <i>deja vu</i>, and he sometimes just knows things- what to do, what to say, what to think- without having any idea why.  People seem to feel it too, about him- like they remember knowing him from when they were kids.  It scares him, this loss of control, almost more than what his eyes show him...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110006/#Comment_110006" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T09:42:35+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  9:42AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, if Devil Boy were wandering down Highway 15 in South Georgia hoping to get a ride down to Florida where he's got a buddy who'll let him crash for a few weeks, and some painful local cop stereotype decides to roust him, he tries to TALK the cop into leaving him be, while the cop wants to take him in.  The conflict is called and the stakes set- "Be left in peace to continue on" or "Get taken in."<br/>\n<br/>\nTALK gives him 6 dice (there are some fiddly bits for tweaking dice pools, but that isn't relevant just yet), and so these are rolled... (consulting an ORE die roller) resulting in 1, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a 2x1 for a "YES, BUT" success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lose unmatched dice are also significant (how many in each Nature's range, which is high, which is low, if they are all in one, if one has none etc... but for now, it isn't so relevant).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's how it has to go down- Devil Boy's demonic nature exerts itself, and he gets what he wants by doing something horrific.<br/>\n<br/>\nControl returns to the player, and he gets to say how it goes down (though the GM gets to add a "But" to the narration because of the 2x success).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that you get to say what you want out of the conflict, you <i>might </i>(if you declare it) get to say what kind of conflict it is (talking, thinking, or doing), but you DO NOT get to say exactly how you'll achieve your goals.  You do, however, get to say just how it goes down on the other side of the die roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the themes I'm trying to reinforce with this mechanic is a "can I really trust myself?" thing... the characters are smushed between two diametrically opposed forces, and 10 doesn't divide evenly by 3.  Every conflict has the potential to put a character in a bad, mad, dangerous, or tragic position... its intended to add some tension (as well as the fun of imrpov within a dynamically limited range of choices).<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine if you're playing Devil Boy, and he's trying to convince his girlfriend that he hasn't been sleeping around on her, and he succeeds... with a 3x3.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's that going to do to the relationship?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... questions on this first part.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Is this worth pursuing?  Am I the only one who finds not knowing what the character might do sort of facinating, or are others compelled by this idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Should the dice be the final word?  Meaning, should the dice be the end of it- the last and absolute arbiter of a conflict- or should players be able to push things or escalate things at some mechanical risk/cost?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) General comments?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks (and sorry for the sloppy ass shotgun posting... not used to SG's limits)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110028/#Comment_110028" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T10:32:56+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 10:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting.

I have no problem with games that <span style="color: #6600CC;">use mechanics to control character actions. [this was missing previously and added later which is why it's a funky color now]</span><br><br>2) Sure! I mean, maybe, if you want. I don't think it's necessary, but you could put in a mechanic that reinforces something. Maybe it reinforces the demon/angel nature of a character - or puts it at risk. Maybe it reinforces the character role they are cast into. You could either do that because they have a limited pool, and what it takes to fill the pool reinforces some other facet. Or because doing so puts the facet in risk, or pushes it towards an end-game condition, or something else - meaning they can use it anytime, but they better not use it everytime or they'll be hurting.  Again, its fine as is, but if you think something needs more <i>oomph</i>, you can use this to help create that <i>oomph</i>.<br><br>3) A Penny for My Thoughts has a "Yes, And" mechanic and when playing it, everyone got a kick out of it.  I would suggest getting rid of the 4x qualifier and keep it to a "Yes, But" for 2x and a "Yes, And" for 3x or higher.  My gut says if I rolled a "Yes" I would be a little let down, wanting the potential for suprise from the and/but qualifiers.  <br><br>You also mention the GM gets to add the but. To promote group conflict, maybe a player gets to add the but.  Either the Heel to the Hero, and vice versa, or the opponent in the conflict, or some other scheme. Maybe it's like a Polaris role distribution - one player always gets to add the "but" and another the "and".  Maybe the player gets to do both. There's lots of ways to go about it, and at the very least, I'd make it the opponent's job to add the but, which could be the GM or another player, depending on who was involved.<br><br>Which brings up, what happens when two players are involved?  Can you both get no's and yes's (like Primetime Adventures)?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110214/#Comment_110214" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T04:56:19+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  4:56AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent questions Mr. Frewer...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NO/YESBUT/YES/YESAND thing...rolls...contribution...

He's one of the three I have buzzing around in my brain right now.  <br><br><b>The Devil Boy </b> <br>Vince Winston <br><b>Image</b>:  Like a young Clint Eastwood.  Rangy, sort of squinty, and tall.  He wears a red knit hat with little felt horns on it.  <br><b>ACTIONS</b>:  THINK 5d  TALK 4d  DO  6d<br><b>NATURES</b><br><b><i>HORROR  </i></b>1-5  His eyes are portals to a frozen blue hell, which is why he squints so much.  If he opens them wide, he can show someone the true nature of reality- cold, hostile, and hungry.  If he opens them wider, he can scorch the world with that cold, riming everything with hoarfrost and twisted shapes of ice.  His eyes show him the weakest part of a thing- a system, an argument, a person.<br><b><i>EGO  </i></b>6-8   He's a cowboy at heart- a cowboy from the movies, anyhow.  He doesn't have a horse, but he'd love to have a motorcycle one day.  He's not the fastest or the strongest, but he;s tough, and can soak up physical and mental punishment like desert soil soaks up the rain.  He talks slooooow, and earnest, more Sam Elliot when he opens his mouth then Clint.  He's a lousy planner, but a good improviser.     <br><b><i>GRACE  </i></b>9-10  Sometimes he remembers things, like from a dream, and they turn out to be true.  Sometimes, he just knows how to move, or what to say, or answers just occur to him.  Other people feel it too sometimes, and react to him like he were someone they knew when they were kids.  It disturbs him though, because he doesn't feel in control when it happens.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111900/#Comment_111900" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T08:24:35+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  8:24AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2007 8:25AM by Bailywolf.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>SCENE ---<i> It's a long lonely highway when you're travellin' all alone </i> </b><br>GM: Summer in Georgia turns mean around July, gets surly and sullen, and starts throwing its weight around.  Right now, you're feeling it like a fat man sitting on your shoulders, and his sweat is dripping down the back of your shirt.  You're walking along Highway 15 south of Soperton, and the soil you can see in the fields is starting to get sandy, and there's palmettos mixed with the pines now.  How come you're hitching south?<br><br>PLAYER:  Ah... I'm going down to South Florida to crash with a friend.  He sent me an email about needing some help with something.  I got it when I hit the library in Atlanta.<br><br>GM:  Awesome.  What's his name?  <br><br>PLAYER:  Steve Jurgens.  We dropped out of college together.  <br><br>GM:  Cool.  Anything else about him?  <br><br>PLAYER:  He does a lot of drugs, but not because he's a junkie.  He's trying to tune his brain so he can see God.<br><br>GM:  Badass, and somewhat ironic.  You have anything you want right now?<br><br>PLAYER:  No... I'm just walking and hitching.  Zen and the Art of Being a Bum.  If trouble comes, I will let it pass over me, and through me, but I will be unchanged.<br><br>GM:  You think?<br><br>PLAYER:  Well... we'll see, I suppose.<br><br>GM:  Yes, I think we will.  Out of the swaying heat-haze and blacktop mirage, a car emerges, and as it gets closer... yeah, its a cruiser.  Not the colors of the Highway Patrol- a local car.  A sheriff's deputy, in fact.  He slows down, and takes it onto the shoulder when he gets close to you so you'll have to walk past on the driver's side.  <br><br>PLAYER:  Like I said.  Zen.  I'll walk past, and give the officer a little nod as I pass.<br><br>GM:  His aviator shades show you yourself in stereo.  His car is idling high, the AC roaring inside, and even then he's sweating.  He's the real McCoy- big, beefy, with that mean little crew-cut some cops like because it makes them look like Marines.  His face is florid, almost swollen.  He makes you think of fat dog ticks about to pop.<br><br>PLAYER:  Nice.  This is going to go bad, I can tell.<br><br>GM: His window whirs down, and he says something you can't really here, and then his door opens, and he drawls at you, "I said hang on a minute!"<br><br>PLAYER:  I'll hang on, I suppose.  "Yes sir?"<br><br>GM:  "Hot day to be walking, ain't it?  You're not trying to hitch a ride, are you?"<br><br>PLAYER:  "No sir.  That'd be illegal.  I'm just walking."<br><br>GM:  "Where you headed?"<br><br>PLAYER:  "Florida.  A friend invited me down."    <br><br>GM:  "You didn't think maybe it was worth a bus ticket?"<br><br>PLAYER:  I shrug.  "I'm broke.  Just enough to eat occasionally, and smoke a little bit."<br><br>GM:  "You wouldn't be smoking anything other than tobacco, would you boy?"<br><br>PLAYER:  Uh oh, this is going south fast.  "No sir.  Couldn't afford anything else, even if I wanted to."<br><br>GM:  He stares at you, and then says with a growl, "You making fun of me?"<br><br>PLAYER:  I'll try and placate him or something.  "No, I'm just saying..."<br><br>GM:  "Up against the car, boy!"<br><br>PLAYER:  "I haven't' done anything!"<br><br>GM:  "cept make me awful suspicious.  Drop the bag, and up against the car!"<br><br>PLAYER: ...<br><br>GM:  Are you going to do what he says?  You can't help but notice his hand on the but of his revolver.<br><br>PLAYER:  No, I don't want him shoving me around.  I'm going to talk him out of it.  I want a Talking conflict to do it.<br><br>GM:  Cool.  What's your goal?  <br><br>PLAYER:  To convince him I'm harmless and... and to get him to give me a ride further down the road.<br><br>GM:  Sounds good.  His is to make you comply with his orders, and then to force you into the back of the car.  Cool?<br/><br/>PLAYER:  Alright, sounds good.  I've got 4d in TALK, and my Stance is CHILL*, so that's +2d to my TALK.  <br/>* based on the balance of his Drives... just go with this bit for now<br/><br/>GM: No other modifies right now, so roll 'em.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111901/#Comment_111901" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T08:24:46+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  8:24AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2007 8:26AM by Bailywolf.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PLAYER:  OK, I've got... 2, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 so that's a 2x2 success.  I have 3 dice in my Horror range, 2 in Ego, and 1 Grace.  <br/><br/>GM:  So you pulled it off.. using your Horror nature.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  Oh man... yeah. <br/><br/>GM:  So, how does it go down.<br/><br/>PLAYER:  When he grabs my arm, I'll lock eyes with him and say, "Back off!" but his grabbing me made react and let the horrible stuff on the other side of my eyes out.  For a second, his breath fogs like it were freezing out here, and he falls back against the car with his hands thrown up over his face.  He sobs, and says "I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"  He'll do what I want now, just to get away from me.<br/><br/>GM:  Damn... there's nothing quite so pathetic as seeing a big man cry like this.  He's shaking too.  What did you show him?  Do you even know?  He'll let you go, but you don't know if he'll be able to actually drive you anywhere for awhile, and you don't know what kind of mental state he'll be in when he recovers.  What'll you do now?<br/><br/>PLAYER:  Crap... how messed up is he?  <br/><br/>GM:  Hard to tell.  He won't even look at you.  You broke something in him.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  I'll try and talk him out of it.<br/><br/>GM:  He's not listening to anything you say, but you could really press it and make another conflict out of it...<br/><br/>PLAYER:  Yeah... wait, actually no.

A little crossroads with a traffic light, a gas station, and a diner.  When was the last time you ate?<br/><br/>PLAYER:  I don't even remember.  I've got enough for a patty melt or something.  I'm going into the diner.<br/><br/>GM:  The waitress calls you 'Hon' and takes your order.  You get some looks from the lunchtime crowd- both of them.  There a squeaky oscillating fan on the counter, moving the thick air around, and keeping the flies from setting up housekeeping.  But it smells fantastic, all greasy, and salty, and dinery.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  If there's nothing happening here, I'll just eat and go, and get on to Florida.  <br/><br/>GM:  Well, we could skip on ahead, but two Sheriff's cars just pulled up outside...<br/><br/>PLAYER:  Ah hell.  <br/><br/>GM:  Yes, indeedy.  Through the dusty window, you see three men get out, and the form of the Deputy from before in the back of one car.  He still seems to be sobbing.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  Fuck me.<br/><br/>GM:  The three cops idle into the diner, the shorter one with the big hat says to the waitress, "Afternoon, Dee.  You seen a... well, speak of the Devil."<br/><br/>PLAYER:  He's looking right at me, isn't he?<br/><br/>GM:  Sure is.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  I'm going to finish my patty melt real quick.  <br/><br/>GM:  You get it down by the time the lead man idles over.  The other two hang back, one by the front door, and other walking over to where the other door leads to the kitchens.  The short man says, "Son, we got some questions for you.  We need you to come with us."<br/><br/>PLAYER:  How does he say it?<br/><br/>GM:  Like he's not asking you, he's telling you how it's going to happen.  He's got his hand on his big Smith and Wesson too.  The strap is unsnapped.  And he's not standing too close to you either, he's stopped with at least six feet between you and him.  It'll be a DO conflict to get out of this, unless you want to give and go with them.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  Screw that.  I'm not going to end up in a cell in the hickville jail.  Not with Deputy Weepy there to tell them I done bad things.<br/><br/>GM:  So, you're going to officially resist arrest?<br/><br/>PLAYER:  Yeah, I suppose so.<br/><br/>GM:  Since this is sort of a complicated scene, lets break it out a bit into a series.  Getting out of the diner is one conflict.  Evading them is another.  And getting out of town and away is a third.     <br/><br/>PLAYER: So I can get some rollover going?<br/><br/>GM:  Definitely.  You'll get Width-2 extra dice on the next conflict in the series if you tell me what it looks like.<br/><br/>PLAYER:  Cool, alright.  So, getting out of the diner...  I'm sitting by a window, right?<br/><br/>GM:  Yeah...<br/><br/>PLAYER:  OK, then I'm going nod like I'm giving up, stand really slowly, and then bust the window out and jump through it.  <br/><br/>GM:  Cool.  OK, that's your goal.  They obviously want to subdue you and take you in.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  I've got 6d for DO, and my stance has shifted to THOUGHTFUL, so no mod there.  And... 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 10... whew, that's a 2x10 success, and three in Horror, and three in Grace.  <br/><br/>GM:  Man, crazy split... your Ego is totally out of the loop on this one.  <br/><br/>PLAYER:  Alright, when I stand, I'll start to lock eyes with the sheriff, but then something comes over me, like cool hands pressed against my forehead.

In this case, Devil Boy wins- the cop backs off- <b><i>but </i></b> he's so wrecked that he can't give DB a ride into town (and then, there's the story fallout from putting the bad-whammy on a cop...)\n<blockquote>-This is a really important line.

Either outcome here is desirable- on on hand, Devil Boy could make the situation (almost inevitably) more complex by forcing another conflict.  On the other hand, just going with the GM's flow means getting to the next bit of scheduled weirdness faster.  The old 'force your agenda or enjoy riding along with mine' option.\n<blockquote>-Okay, let me make sure I understand this part correctly.

Does the \u201cand\u201d part have to be beneficial to the player-character?</blockquote>\nIts another "yes, but" result.  He escapes, <b><i>but </i></b>gets cut up in the process.  \n<blockquote>-This is interesting.  What mechanical effect would this turn of events have on the game for the next scene (or two)?</blockquote>\n<br/>In truth, not much, except the becomes an element that's "on the table" from this point on.  Devil Boy's player has to think about it, and the GM can leverage it for further scenes... the Sheriff might track him with dogs now, or he might need to get to a doctor before he passes out.  Its something else to use in framing a scene, a conflict, or the goals and stakes for a conflict.  <br/><br/>I don't have anything here on how failure and trying again works.<br/><br/>If Devil Boy had been apprehended when trying to escape, then that's established as true in the game- cut to the next scene, Devil Boy being booked at the County Jail. <br/><br/>Alternately, DB's player can try and force the issue- immediatly trying a different tactic for escape.  He changes his action type (DO proved a bust... now, TALK might work), but this means the consequences for failure are going to be worse.  Now, instead of just getting caught, he might get caught and beaten to shit or shoot in the belly.  If he pushes it again, <i>then </i>he's risking lasting consequences which will either end the character or permanently change him.  Basically, if you blow it on the third escalation roll, its your ass.<br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112027/#Comment_112027" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T11:55:31+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 11:55AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing which is still pretty woobly right now is what the other dice (the ones that don't match up) mean mechanically and narratively.  <br/><br/>You look at which range they fall into... the range with the most dice in it will have some special effect.  <br/><br/>Not sure what though.<br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112270/#Comment_112270" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T06:17:04+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  6:17AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bailywolf</cite>Another thing which is still pretty woobly right now is what the other dice (the ones that don't match up) mean mechanically and narratively.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nHere's a thought.  Let's say players can keep roll results from any die from their Horror or Grace catagory, but it costs them.  That cost is the lowering of the dicepool by 1 that is attached to the opposite attribute.  If a player can accumulate 5 dice with the same value, he can add 5 dice permanently to each of his pools for Horror and Grace.  Ego is neurtal, and thus randomly shows up at the same strength in each conflict.<br/><br/>That may be a little more complicated than you want.  Or it may not work at all.  But I do agree that it would be cool to address the unused dice in your system.<br/><br/>But on the whole, I think you've got a rocking game here!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113731/#Comment_113731" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T07:06:19+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  7:06AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John Harper is cooking something delicious over at The Might Atom on a <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2007/12/suffering-mechanic.html" rel="nofollow">suffering mechanic</a>.  <br/><br/>This very neatly formalizes narrative consequences in that each way your character Suffers has a specific set of narrative prohibitions- things you simply can't do while suffering.  Each also comes with a buy-off, the kind of action or scene needed to recover from it.  Devil Boy's injury from the broken class could be quantified this way.  It would restrict any kind of running or other speedy escape, and make it very hard to evade pursuit.  The buy-off would be getting someone to stitch him up and tend his wounds, which demands the introduction of a new character and source of conflict, thus pumping up the drama.  <br/><br/>In fact, by this resolution scheme, the "but" result could work like this- as a consequence to be suffered which shapes future narrative truths in the shared game space.  When he uses his whammy on the cop, what he could Suffer there might be "trouble with the locals" which would mean he'd have a lot of difficulty with the authorities until he managed to somehow vindicate himself (the buy-off).<br/><br/>One might also take  consequences to get an extra die or two to roll after the fact- possibly adding a match to a set of loose dice.<br/><br/><br/>THIS is precisely why I love the bubbling stewpot of the indie game thing.  <br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113957/#Comment_113957" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T21:49:28+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  9:49PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bailywolf</cite>John Harper is cooking something delicious over at The Might Atom on a<a></a></blockquote>\nI don't get it.

In the above example, Devil Boy gets sort of cut up going through the glass.  That'll have narrative consequences, obviously, but the Suffering mechanic makes them a bit more specific.  Each thing you Suffer has a Taboo- things you can't do- and a Buy-Off- what you do to get over it, and remove the taboo.  John's example is 'Humiliation' which makes it taboo for you to aggressively engage people socially, but can be bought off by picking a fight with someone sympathetic to your character.  <br/><br/>Devil Boy's might be "Lame".  The Taboo would be "Move quicker than a fast walk, run, jump, or otherwise move easily and at speed" and the Buy-Off could be "Find someone to tend wounds and provide safe rest".  His player can lump the Taboo, but he's got a strong motivation to seek a scene where he has to engage with a new character.  <br/><br/>John was going to use these for Trollbabe style re-rolls.... I was considering making them the result of "BUT" and "NO" results, as well as providing a couple of extra dice if someone willingly chooses to Suffer.  <br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114580/#Comment_114580" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T15:38:27+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  3:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, of course, would like to hear more about this, and would even like to playtest it.
