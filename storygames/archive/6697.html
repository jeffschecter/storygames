As originally posted this to <a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/blog" rel="nofollow">www.tenra-rpg.com/blog</a> :<br/><br/>==========<br/>Hi all! It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve updated the development blog. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve been too busy lately with development! Seriously, June\u2019s going to be a rough month, filled with blood, sweat, and editing tears.<br/><br/>After looking over the rather plain character sheet that I\u2019ve been using for demonstration games and the like, and faced with the idea of creating a new sheet with my limited graphical skills for an English release, I decided to turn my attention to those folks out there who have far more graphical skill than me, and hold a contest!<br/><br/>In short, it\u2019s a contest, complete with prizes, for the person who submits the best Tenra Bansho Zero character sheets - a game which nobody owns, and which few have played! However, using my original English sheets as a frame of reference, and with a little explanation, I doubt that folks with some graphic/layout experience would have much trouble making something awesome.<br/><br/>The bleeding short: Deadline is June 29th (3+ weeks); Prizes are $50, $20, and copies of the final game book; you retain the rights to your work, and allow us to distribute the sheet; final submissions are emailed to ziggurat ATMARK gmail.com.<br/>The \u201cContest Pack\u201d can be downloaded at the following location, in RAR and ZIP flavors. It contains the rules and all the reference material you need to begin: <a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/</a><br/>==========<br/><br/>The Full Rules:<br/><br/>===========<br/><b>OVERVIEW</b><br/>Tenra Bansho Zero is nearing completion at long last. This summer, we will see pre-release play guides, and enough material to get started playing the game. However, the original Tenra Bansho Zero character sheet was pretty pedestrian, and my attempts to bring it into an English version have been highly focused on \u201cpragmatic/practical\u201d, with zero focus placed on \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like ass\u201d. So I\u2019m looking to the fan community, folks peripherally interested in the game: Folks with some design talent, who would be interested in making a character sheet up for a game they\u2019ve (most likely) never played before, know little about, in a contest with some small prizes.<br/>I want to encourage fan creations, fan-made materials and the like for the game, and this is the first step in doing so. The character sheet. The cornerstone of any pen-and-paper tabletop RPG.<br/><br/><b>PRIZES</b><br/>The winner of the contest will receive $50.00 Cash (US), plus a free copy of the final Tenra Bansho Zero RPG (plus shipping) when it is released in early 2009.<br/>The runner up in the contest will receive $20.00 Cash (US), plus a free copy of the final Tenra Bansho Zero RPG (plus shipping) when it is released in early 2009.<br/>The third place winner will receive a free copy of the pre-release Tenra Bansho Zero rules (plus shipping) when it is released in late summer 2008.<br/>For people outside the US, I will send the money via Paypal or International Postal Money Order (your choice).<br/><br/><b>DATES</b><br/>Begins Immediately (June 05, 2008) and lasts until 11:59PM on the evening of Sunday, June 29th, 2008. A little over three weeks, and 4 weekends. Submissions are entertained at any point throughout the contest, up until the cut off date (Monday the 30th).<br/><br/>(cont)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148439/#Comment_148439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T14:08:06+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  2:08PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>JUDGING</b><br/>All judging will be performed by me (Andy K, Project Lead). I\u2019ll be scoring them on feel, creativity, beauty, and usefulness/practicality. It\u2019s understood that most people have not played the game, that\u2019s already taken into consideration. Final scoring will be presented on the www.tenra-rpg.com website on July 1st, 2008. Prize money will be awarded (sent) within 5 days of that date.<br/><br/><b>MATERIALS</b><br/>1) You will be given the following materials to work with:<br/>A document called \u201ctenra_char_anatomy.txt\u201d, which walks you through the important parts of a TBZ character sheet, why the elements are there, and other important data bits.<br/>Two pages of an English version of the character sheet, for reference.<br/>Two pages of a filled-out English version of the character sheet, so you know what it looks like when filled out.<br/>A sample character on the original Japanes sheet, for visual reference/historical knowledge (not looking to directly recreate this sheet, mind).<br/>All these materials will be available for download from the following link:<br/><a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/</a><br/>(the file will be called \u201ccontest materials\u201d or something like that)<br/>2) You can use any outside materials you want to: Borders, graphical art materials, fonts, etc. However, you must own the rights to create and distribute works using that material.<br/><br/><b>FORMAT</b><br/>1) The submitted format should be 8.5\xd711 inches, \u201cLetter\u201d sized.<br/>2) You may complete the character on one sheet, or use up to two sheets. Portrait/Landscape is up to you (original is two portrait sheets side-by-side, which formed a landscape sheet for printing).<br/>3) If you are from Europe/Asia, feel free to aim for A4, but in a way where there will be no issues printing on letter-sized paper (the final format for the book).<br/>4) You should create two versions of the sheet: If using Photoshop/Illustrator or the like, submit the work as psd/ai with all layers attached (for later editing/expansion), or else if it\u2019s a software that can save as pdf, send the pdf. With it, submit a picture version of that sheet (TIFF or JPG). Extra consideration for winning will go to people who submit the sheet in a presumably editable format like ai/psd with layers, or editable pdf (so that I might use your sheet as a base, and craft downloadable complete character and the like, using Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat or compatible software).<br/>Again, that is:<br/>- TIFF or JPG<br/>and<br/>-original PSD/AI/PDF/DOC/other \u201cworksheet\u201d data<br/><br/><b>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</b><br/>1) See format guidelines.<br/>2) When you submit, compress all materials you are submitting with RAR, ZIP or TAR.<br/>3) If possible, email the set to me at ziggurat ATMARK gmail.com<br/>4) You can also post your materials online somewhere (your own website, etc), and send me the download link.<br/>5) If neither method is available for you, contact me before Friday June 27th, 2008 and we will work something out.<br/>6) You can submit as many different character sheets as you want before the deadline.<br/><br/>PUBLISHING RIGHTS<br/>0) Submitting an entry to this contest means that you accept the following:<br/>*You give me the rights to edit, use and distribute the sheet as I see fit.<br/>-By edit, I am primarily referring to the ability to update attribute/skill/other names if they change for the final releas of the Tenra Bansho Zero game, or minor changes like changing a font you use to one that is more consistent with the core book\u2019s font selection, and the like. Game Editing, essentially.<br/>-I also mean the ability to use your sheet to draft ready-to-play sample characters for free download, or to be inluded in the game book or future supplements.<br/>-All edits will be told to you in advance, so you will not be left in the dark.<br/>*However, you will still own the rights to your work as well, and can publish, distribute, use or change your sheet however you see fit after you submit it to me. You are giving me the rights to use your sheet, and in so you do not lose the rights to your own work as well.<br/><br/>1) I will post ALL submissions on the www.tenra-rpg.com website for one week.<br/>2) After that, most (if not all) of the submissions will remain on the website indefinitely for the benefit of the community.<br/>3) I will include the first and second place winners\u2019 submissions in the final version of Tenra Bansho Zero core rulebook as optional character sheets.<br/><br/><b>QUESTIONS</b><br/>can be directed to Andy K, at ziggurat ATMARK gmail.com or through whispers here in this thread.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148443/#Comment_148443" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T14:16:30+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  2:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, if there's anyone who's not following what Tenra Bansho Zero is, it's best described by the cover art:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/secret-samples/tenra-hyoshi.jpg"/><br/><br/>...except that the above picture does not contain brain-smashing heavy metal guitar riffs, which is part of my image of the game. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151769/#Comment_151769" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T22:24:38+00:00" title="June 19, 2008 10:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only 10 days left (and two weekends) to get in on the action!
