What is cool/unique/interesting/good about your game?<br/></blockquote>\nHi Dan, well, I thought my signature plays were pretty cool and unique until I read Apocalypse World a few weeks ago.  Now I think they are just cool.<br/><br/>Im am also trying to outline a procedure for resolving conflicts in a cinematic/dramtic style that I havent seen anywhere else, but my knowledge of other games is very patchy, so that might not end up being unique either, but if it works, it works.<br/><br/>I am experimenting with dividing the game into two phases - a story phase and a challenge phase, each of which works differently.  The idea behind that is that story phase is contributive narration that sets the context for challenge phases which are played more traditionally with explicit goal setting.<br/><br/>The reward cycle is based around players explicitly setting a mixture of personal motivation based (character based) goals and situation based goals, and then achieving them.   So 'playing your character' is explicitly rewarded by setting, elaborating on, and achieving those type of goals, and similarly for situation-based goals.  These explicit goals feed into the dramatic/cinematic resolution style during challenge phase in the form of  procedural advice to the GM on how to structure scenes and conflict.  i.e. around those goals.<br/><br/>Lastly, inspired by IAWA, each challenge phase needs to be associated with a random phrase or mood.  the players collectively decide how to interpret the random hint during story phase and use it to shape the events in a general way that happen during that phase so that they arrive at that challenge.  <br/><br/>Please read my doco and comment!  its only 20 pages\n<blockquote><br/>If you don't think you've explained how to play, why are you asking people to try to play it?

Rest assured I have done my best, but I imagine playtesting will result in rewrites so Ill leave adornment of the text until it is more stable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313787/#Comment_313787" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T18:44:04+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  6:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2011 6:45PM by stefoid.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            argh, bloody quote system                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313892/#Comment_313892" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T09:56:02+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  9:56AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Please read my doco and comment!  its only 20 pages</blockquote>\nI started reading but I still can't really figure out what the keys points of the design are.

In fact, if I get to the stage where I want to make it presentable to a wide audience, I would start with a blank paper and rewrite it from scratch with that aspect in mind.  <br/><br/>Yes, action-packed and high drama, good characterisation.  So not say, Rambo.  But maybe Toby Maguire Spiderman.  However, Im not specifically aiming at 'movies' per se, but a cinematic/dramatic conflict resolution style.  Im taking my cue from action movies in that respect, but my aim isnt to replicate a particular type of movie exactly.<br/><br/>But why do I have to be more specific than that?   Why cant my aim just be to be able to produce "action-packed and high drama, good characterisation" ?   <br/><br/>I completely understand that a lot of 'indie games'  have a narrow premise that they aim precisely at.   And that is easier to design, easier to pitch, and easier to pick up at playing time, as long as the player is interested in that specific premise.  But thats not what I want.  I specifically want to present a particular style of play "action-packed and high drama, good characterisation" but nothing more narrow than that.  <br/><br/>So thats what my game needs to be judged by -- do the mechanics and rules back that up?     <br/><br/>Heres what I think is important takeaways for players.<br/>They need to agree on  a premise that explicitly states, for their game, What the <b>main thing that the characters will try to achieve</b> and what is the <b>main method/obstacle </b> to that?<br/><br/>The main thrust of the characterisation/drama is that players need to take between 4 and 6 motivations<br/><br/>They need to explicitly set at least one long term goal. <br/><br/><b>setting + premise + motivations  + LTGs  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; initial situation</b> <br/><br/>Motivations feed into character goals<br/>character goals feed into dramatic conflict<br/><br/>Also, the random story phase phrases and contributive narration (combined/intertwined with the character-based stuff) is supposed to help drive the plot -- leads to explicitly setting situation-based goals which leads to situation-based conflicts.  If you can get both types mixed into one situation, then even better!<br/><br/>Its the explicit goal setting which is key.  <b>Motviations/situation &gt;&gt;&gt;  explicit goal setting  &gt;&gt;&gt; dramtic conflict</b>\n<blockquote> I dislike it when a game says, "Just do something!

I want to give more explicit instructions and I want to really emphasise the points that turn out to be crucial to the style of play Im trying to make, but I dont know how to yet.  Im playtesting with my group for the second time tomorrow.  The first playetst was a complete disaster as a game!  It was a great playtest however.  I learned so much that I couldnt have possibly anticipated because Im a relative newbie to RPG design - to critically analysing what goes on at the table rather than being uncritically subject to it.  <br/><br/>I cant wait to find out what happens at the next playtest, and also if I could get a 3rd party playtest without me there...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313968/#Comment_313968" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T14:49:37+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  2:49PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Hi Dan, you mean if I can pitch the game to you, youll playtest it, or just in general?</blockquote>\nIn general.

I see a good design in there, but you have to piece it together. I'll break down what I think is strong in the design:<br/><br/>-the explicitly defined motivations [though saying "4 - 6" is wishy-washy; pick a number and stick with it, and also stick with one of each "type," to increase character focus]<br/>-specific rewards for pursuing and achieving goals [both long and short-term]<br/>-the "plays" that must be tied to the "backgrounds" [I would also suggest just saying that you get to pick a play for each background, and make plays add a bonus die. For your "other" types of play, I'd let each character pick a "signature" ability, that targets Body/Soul/what have you. Basically, "plays" add bonuses to Background actions, and "signatures" do stuff outside of dice rolls. That's my opinion.]<br/><br/>Combining those three things can make for a very focused character that demands certain scenes. Is your special play "diving through plate-glass windows?" Well then, I guess there better be some plate glass windows to dive through, right? Preferably while being shot at by bad guys. So, this part is quite good.<br/><br/>-the concept of "backgrounds" instead of specific skills (however, I'd try to shore up the backgrounds a bit and drive them to be more specific - this is where examples are useful)<br/><br/>This keeps the action from getting too mired in dice. This is good. These three elements together suggest a faster-paced, tight, action-driven sort of play. Good. A character is comprised of a handful of defining features, which act together in a neat little package to deliver an action kick to your face.<br/><br/>However, you lose me in the Story Phase. "Suggest things that sound cool." What? That's crap. Put something crunchy in there. Some kind of mechanic that <i>directs</i> the Story Phase. Every other part seems quite directed, so don't flounder here. And no, no matter how well your players design their motivations, it won't be enough to "carry" them through the Story Phase. You need some kind of machinery to keep the momentum going.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>But why do I have to be more specific than that?</blockquote>Why?

Played years of runequest early on as my first introduction,and some cyberpunk, (and paranoia which was way cool)  then got heartilly sick of it and stopped roleplaying for many years, then got back into it via Herowars  GMed by a guy who didnt get it at all and played by houserules such that it was runequest with a new glorantha source book, some dying earth with the same guy using same method.   Designed my own fantasy heartbreaker which didnt do what I wanted it to do, stopped roleplaying for another few years and then last year or so I bought DITV but have never played it yet, played a couple of sessions of IAWA, and a couple of sessions of PTA, and here I am trying to design my own game again.<br/><br/>Is Danger Patrol flexible?  If you want to play characters who constantly seek danger for its own sake then its great.<br/><br/>Yep, creative input on the premise and characterisation is what I mean.  Creative input on the story, outside of the reactions of a players own character is not so important, but I relaize that some players value that more than others, so my 'contributive' narration is optional.  However within their own character's domain, the players are strongly encouraged to have input (currently in a vague hand wavy fashion) through the reward of setting and elaborating of explicit goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark" title="TheWhaleShark"><img alt="TheWhaleShark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark">TheWhaleShark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314012/#Comment_314012" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T17:05:53+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  5:05PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>who constantly seek danger for its own sake</blockquote>No, they put themselves in dangerous situations because they need to save Rocket City!<br/><br/>The <i>players</i> create danger for the hell of it, but with the notion that the danger they're creating is because their characters are trying to save people.

Your story game experience sounds limited.<br/><br/>I'm probably going to wind up designing 3 or 4 "premises" along with "backgrounds" and pitch them to a group of players. See who bites and who wants to change what, and go from there.<br/><br/>But you should take note that there are many successful and highly-regarded designers around today who have made games with a strong "premise" and make <i>implementing</i> that premise the flexible part.

It's also not a set-in-stone thing. I present them with the premise and backgrounds that I feel represent the premise. If they like it, fine. If they want something else, we make it work.<br/><br/>It's always better to give <i>something</i> as opposed to saying "come up with it." Rule 0 exists irrespective of the game, so if we need to change something we will. Leaving an empty void and saying "fill this in" is just asking for some control freak to take over the game with his ideas. You need to control for the situation where one player molds the entire premise around his character.<br/><br/>EDIT: And I don't mean that I would tell players what their character's backgrounds have to be. I would do something like compile a list of 15 backgrounds and say, "OK, these are things that I think fit in this setting. Pick what you want and distribute your points accordingly." I don't make people's characters for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314031/#Comment_314031" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T18:29:58+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  6:29PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2011 12:33AM by stefoid.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cool, if it helps, this is what my players are coming up with.

A great change from the first disappointing, shamble of a  game.  I went into this playtest a lot more at ease and confident in my methods which would have helped a lot in itself.   The emphasis on preparing the setup beforehand - premise and character motives was a big help in this regard, as well as arming myself with a few basic tactics of  for challenge phase resolution.  Handling roadblocks and introducing dilemmas.  <br/><br/>In this session, I wasnt focused so much on running the story phase in a radically different way from the challenge phase -- like I didnt sit there and demand of my players "now you make something up!"  The players were free to contribute to the fiction outside the bounds of their own character actions if they wished, but nobody did, and I didnt fuss about that.  Its a perfectly functional way to play the game like that and I also think 3 out of the 4 characters had fairly tangential motivations which didnt help them in that regard.  That was a point I underlined.<br/><br/>What I learned:<br/>1) The premise is a key.  <b>The players need to take it seriously and use it to inform both their character concepts and also their motivations.</b><br/>2) motivations another real key to my game.  IF the players dont treat the motivation preparation seriously - if they come up with weak or tangential motivations, then they are making it hard for themselves.  2 of my 4 players came to the table without motivations pre-prepared, which I asked them to do.  That, and the fact that I hadnt stressed the nature of motivations as well as I should, nor their utmost importance, saw them come up with weak, largely irrelevant motivations to what was going down.   So the other big thing is <b>use the premise to inform about the nature of the motivations</b> - make them relevant to the premise.  Basically the players should be looking at the possible motivations and asking themselves - how is this going to come into play given the premise? <br/>3) the choice of initial long term goal should also have good relevance for the premise, but this is going to flow from the motivations fairly naturally.<br/><br/>I found it very useful to have a sheet in front of me with  abbreviated character details of all the 4 players on the one page.  mentioning their name, their concept and their motivations in shorthand (two words only).  I constantly referred to this.<br/><br/>The main thing I want to work on is the story phase dragged on a bit in both cases.  The challenge phrases I rolled for each one were not immediately useful to the situation, but after mulling over for a while, as the players were doing their thing ,eventually I thought of neat tie ups.  very neat tie-ups actually.  Its very hard to wing it on the fly - its not a style of GMing I have done much of - and the challenge phrases really helped a lot.  Its like the difference between starting with a blank page when faced with the question "what happens now?" -- instead you start with a page that has a short phrase, in my case the first was 'standoff!' and the 2nd was 'make a friend', and the question is 'how do we get from here to there'.  It just gives the seed that you can riff of off and it worked a treat - eventually.<br/><br/>Next time I would bring down the challenge phrase related bang more quickly, rather than letting the story phrase drag on for as long as I did.  After the first one went well, I had more confidence to bring the second one down quickly when the story phase started to run out of puff as the players started to show signs of lacking directed activity.  So I suppose the thing to remember is the story phase doesnt need to be dramatic in itself, although if it is, then great, but if it isnt, fast forward to the next challenge as soon as the story phase starts to tire.  Roll that story phase dice as soon as the end of the last challenge phase and start riffing in your head, while the players play out their reactions / consequences.  Sometimes the next challenge phase will be a logical consequence of the last challenge phase -- the phrase will have immediate synergy.  Other times it wont, and thats when the GM needs to introduce a new challenge phrase related bang.  After all the logical consequences have already been hashed out in the story phase of course.  You dont want to short circuit that, just wait for it to run down of its own accord.<br/><br/>I found it incredibly helpful to have a list of 50 names on hand.  Was playing ancient greece, and I could just seemlessly grab a plausible name whenever I needed it -- helped a lot.<br/><br/>Lastly, and this is something I totally stole from reading Apocalypse World -- <b>ask questions</b>!  Why didnt I ever think of that before?  I wrote it down in my doco because it seemed clever, but I really put it into practice tonight.  whenever the players seemed to have that 'not really sure what to do right now' look about them, especially just after a challenge phase finished, I just turned to someone and asked, "so what does so&amp;so think of what just happened?'  and guess what, they consider it and answer!  And then they riff off their own answer and narrate their character acting on that answer.  Just a little kick up the bum for the players, and it works so well.  use judiciously...  thanks Vincent Baker!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314338/#Comment_314338" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T20:02:19+00:00" title="February 25, 2011  8:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doco upgraded to reflect the above, and I also added a section specifically on social conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314555/#Comment_314555" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T15:58:44+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  3:58PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some more updates and explanations added.<br/><br/>One thing I did do was make a rule that gives a character who is only performing a defensive play for a particular contest a +1 bonus.
