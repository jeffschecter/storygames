Does the door squeak?<br/><br/>It's plausible that it might, and it's plausible that it might not.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the player will narrate, "I open the door quietly."  Sometimes, the GM will narrate, "The door opens quietly."  Sometimes, one will simply narrate that the character opens the door, with no one caring about whether it squeaks or not.<br/><br/>And then there are those special times where we roll dice.<br/><br/><b>I've rolled for all sorts of stupid reasons</b>.  <br/><br/>I've rolled out of habit when the roll result was irrelevant.  I've rolled when the roll results were subsequently overruled by someone's narration.  I've rolled when one roll result was bad for play.  (Oh god, how many times that used to happen!  "I roll to find the next clue.  I fail.  I now have no clue and nothing to do and now the game is no fun.")  I've also rolled for inspiration when I didn't need any.<br/><br/><b>So what are the fun, functional reasons I've rolled?</b><br/><br/>I've rolled to resolve which player gets their way about what happens next.  I've rolled to add dramatic suspense to a fictional event.  I've rolled to simulate the probabilities of some crucial event going one way or the other.  I've rolled to introduce fun new elements into the fiction.  There are more that I'm not thinking of, I'm sure.<br/><br/>The thing that's on my mind right now is:<br/><br/><b><i>None</i> of these are universally necessary.</b> <br/><br/>You can still agree on who gets to narrate, and decide how long to draw a scene out, and simulate the most logical outcome, and add content without touching dice.  An RPG that tells you when to use the dice is telling you a potentially <i>huge</i> amount about what you're expected to care about, and expend energy on, and be good at.<br/><br/>Huge procedural gaps assume that players can handle those parts themselves -- how to pick a GURPS setting, how to create a good Rifts adventure, how to pace a series of Fiasco scenes, how to agree on physics in Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>Single rolls imply that players will care about the outcome on the indicated level of detail -- like picking a pocket or removing a trap in D&amp;D2.  Series of rolls imply that players will care about each mini-outcome, like the temporary advantages of combat.<br/><br/>And every roll you ever make implies that your play group wouldn't have done better just determining an outcome.  In every formal gaming activity besides RPGs, that's a "No duh" point.  That's what most games <i>are</i>.  But roleplaying is at times a close cousin of playing pretend, and telling stories.  And quite often, the players are in fact the best option to decide what happens, and all the rules need to do is help them play nice together.<br/><br/>This is why I'm currently enamored of rules that explicitly invoke die-rolling relative to players' strengths and dispositions, rather than to classes of fictional tasks.  If my D&amp;D2 book had said "Roll lock-picking only for fun, dramatic locks that can stand failure", it would have been a much shorter route to functional play.<br/><br/>Integrating these kinds of situationally applicable rules with the more game-standard type (which define what play is and what you can do) is something of a disorienting challenge for me.  Right now I'm really appreciating games whose set-ups enable the players to do most of the subsequent resolving themselves.<br/><br/>Apologies for lengthy ramble.  If you found my point somewhere in there, please tell me what it is!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302393/#Comment_302393" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T01:06:08+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  1:06AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            :tumbsup:<br/><br/>I'll just suggest that the distinction between conflict and task resolution is drawn fairly close to this vague line.

And we can't escape that kind of judgment call, unless we want to have game mechanics that only interact with each other, instead of with the fiction also. That whole clouds &amp; dice thing.<br><br>I think what's really interesting is when a game text very, very explicitly sets up conditions for rolling/randomizing/whatever. Apocalypse World does this very clearly with moves, but there are some equally explicit methods that work quite differently than that - in Polaris, a conflict is only a conflict when there is a clash between player interests, and the only way we avoid, as Vincent says, "unity of interests among players", is by egging each other on into being good Mistaken and good Hearts. Those roles are defined in really clear-cut ways to, basically, do the job of defining when a clash of interests occurs. <br><br>As far as single-roll vs. multi-roll, I completely agree that we have to make procedures that address what people actually care about - this is also one of the easiest ways to tell when a game's priorities or "coverage" are just not interesting to a player: "Aw, man, we have to roll for <i>that</i>? Who cares?<br><br>I dunno how much I have to add to what you're saying, David, but I think a good design generally encourages us to take the risk of engaging the mechanics - if we properly arrange what's important in play so that you cannot avoid the mechanics (and thus, not just avoid dice rolls in particular), then the only time someone will run away from the mechanics is, maybe, when they aren't really interested in the content of the game itself.<br><br>I played a game of <i>Doomtown</i> once, and one of my opponents became primarily interested in accumulating Ghost Rock (currency) rather than pluggin' dudes in the street or trying to take over territory. She did become quite invested in our social-level procedures, attempting to create and then enforce a "ruling" that we could not expand our pile of chits for Ghost Rock beyond the initial bag of poker chips we were using.<br>She wanted to achieve mastery of system in a very particular way - essentially, she wanted to accumulate all available currency, and cause a liquidity crisis. Not exactly a victory condition.<br><br>I guess my point in bringing that up is that, clearly, the general thrust of play was not very interesting to her - she's not very competitive, so fighting over resources wasn't her thing - so she found a way to use available options in a clever way to gain dominance in another field. If there were some kind of "you win 'cause yer so wealthy" condition, I'm sure she would have shot right towards it. And followed all connected procedures correctly. <br><br>Incidentally, she's much more interested in RtD play than in Stepping On Up - I think this was a factor, even though <i>Doomtown</i> is a CCG. It was actually a minor struggle at times when playing Polaris with her and her partner, as she needed some coaching to be an effective Mistaken for me, which is kind of a competitive element nestled within a classic Story Now game. <br><br>Anyway. <br>/ramble                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302411/#Comment_302411" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T09:59:01+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  9:59AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roll when failing is interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302412/#Comment_302412" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T10:06:37+00:00" title="November 27, 2010 10:06AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about the whole task resolution vs. conflict resolution thing recently. It's not clear to me that everyone thinks of story in a way that conflict resolution makes sense. The conventional wisdom in these parts is that task resolution is generally conflict resolution with implicit stakes. I'm not so sure that's true anymore, because I don't think everybody has a mental model of "story" in which conflict is central -- some people seem to be more focused on deeply understanding a static situation rather than in transforming situations into a new situations. I'm starting to think that sometimes what players want from a task resolution roll is objective affirmation of their current character conception. I don't think the player always cares about the stakes for a Stealth roll he wants to make, I think he sometimes wants the game to acknowledge that his character is the Stealth Guy. From the player's perspective, I think there's a big qualitative difference between "say yes" and "roll the dice". When you roll the dice there's a lot of tension, excitement, focus, and the feeling of objectivity: the dice can't lie. If you're really Stealth Guy then the dice will tell you that you succeed at Stealth Stuff. If your buddy across the table tells you that you're Stealth Guy, that's <i>nice</i> but it's just an opinion, even if that buddy has special game authority as the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302414/#Comment_302414" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T10:46:34+00:00" title="November 27, 2010 10:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2010 10:47AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan, re: Stealth Guy, I've definitely seen that be the case, and I've definitely seen that not be the case.  It all depends on whether you paid or strategized to become Stealth Guy, or just grabbed it as a free color option at char-gen; and on whether the payoffs for auto-successes are rewarding.<br><br>I think this issue of when to roll vs when to resolve purely verbally is much much larger than task vs conflict resolution.  If you replace my squeaky doors and picked locks with crises of faith or duels to the death, the questions still remain.  I mean, it's not hard for me to imagine a game where my character and Fred's character duel to the death, and based on a turn or bidding structure, Jeff gets to decide which of us dies, with no die rolls.<br><br>I think when conflict resolution mechanics help streamline the die-rolling is when they require some discussion of who cares and of what outcomes are acceptable.  But when they don't -- like, say, in a game that says "roll whenever two characters are at cross purposes; high roll wins" -- then we're no better off than with a similarly mute task system.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302419/#Comment_302419" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T11:12:51+00:00" title="November 27, 2010 11:12AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2010 11:15AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>lets say i roll to lock pick and get a 1, if you tell me the lock opens how is that going to make me feel, probably patronized or maybe take the tension out of future rolls.</blockquote>Agreed!

I don't what the point of it is, either, but lots to think about.<br/><br/>From what hasn't already been said, to continue the stream of consciousness style you've established:<br/><br/>* Sometimes rolling the dice is a <i>ritual</i>. It's not the outcome that matters, it's the act itself. (Three examples, especially, come to mind: 1) Rolling for initiative, 2) "rolling up" a new character, 3) throwing down all your dice in a game like Dogs in the Vineyard--a very demonstrative action, especially when you have a big pile, even if the very next thing that happens is that one party or the other just Gives.)<br/><br/>That's when the desired effect is the "clatter of dice". What mental space does that clatter put you in? What memories does that clatter bring back?<br/><br/>* Sometimes rolling the dice is used by GMs in the following way:<br/><br/>We're playing, and something has come up--perhaps a character action, or some tense situation, who knows? In any case, the GM suddenly hits a moment where he/she <i>doesn't know what to say</i>. Like, the game was rolling along, people are talking and gesticulating and announcing actions. It's some kind of flow state. But then there is silence. Nothing concrete is entering the GM's mind; but it's the GM's turn to speak, and everyone is expecting an answer.<br/><br/>Many, many GMs I've played with (including myself, actually) use this technique. "Roll the dice!" This works best, of course, in a game where you roll the same dice every time, so the player doesn't have to respond with, "Uh, which die do I roll for this?"<br/><br/>As the dice are rolling, there is a moment to think. Once they settle, people have a reaction to those numbers. And that, alone, might be enough to inspire an answer. Sometimes the GM knows what it is (like your "the picks are stuck in the lock, roll again!"), sometimes the players do ("Oh, shit! Looks like the vase flies right through my hands!", or, "Hell, yeah! I totally chop its head off!").<br/><br/>And whoever does that little bit of talking... they've got those numbers backing them up now. Maybe it's a low result: now you're making something like a "hard move" in Apocalypse World, and no one will complain. Because that player rolled low, so they deserve it, you know? Shouldn't have rolled if they couldn't hang with the results, snap.<br/><br/>Either way, the dice back you up.<br/><br/>(Now, of course, this technique has some issues... because what if it's an "average" roll? But we're game designers, we can find a way around that issue...)<br/><br/>It's fun to look back at the various tools we came up with to play "traditional" games (in this context, games that don't always tell when you should roll), and see how we can revisit them, maybe twisting them into some new form as we go along.<br/><br/>What else remains "undiscovered" from our "traditional" games? I'm sure we'll keep digging up more and more stuff...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302500/#Comment_302500" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-28T14:04:19+00:00" title="November 28, 2010  2:04PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, your original post is solid and fundamental. Honestly, that should be the starting point for thinking about resolution design nowadays. "When to roll" was a big issue for some of the Game Chef games this year, so it's definitely a pertinent discussion topic.<br/><br/>Really, "conflict" and "task" resolution are very broad categories that can get in the way of deciding what kinds of things to roll for in a given game (they are useful, but only to a point).  It's much easier if you can be really specific about the circumstances in which you roll dice, which is part of what's so refreshing about the way moves are structured in Apocalypse World ("when you do X thing, roll Y dice").  It's a very straightforward, almost object-oriented (as in computer programming) approach to rule design and could potentially be applied to both "conflict" and "task" style resolution, as well as to things that aren't clearly conflicts or tasks or even resolution in a traditional sense (for example: "when you're beginning a new session but haven't played in a while, write a love letter to the players and ask them to roll Y dice").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302507/#Comment_302507" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-28T15:36:06+00:00" title="November 28, 2010  3:36PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, <b>Apocalypse World</b> is definitely a nice example.  Rolling for success in various categories corresponding to various character stats feels "old school" to some, but these aren't in-gameworld-causality resolutions.  The categories and results are all about what's dramatically interesting in apocalyptic story.  Which I assume is what Vincent decided was important for this game.<br/><br/><b>Polaris</b>, on the other hand, tells the players how to determine the important stuff themselves, with rules that govern that discussion.<br/><br/><b>Trail of Cthulhu</b> advises the GM on good scenarios, inspires the players to get the vibe right, and occasionally blasts your Sanity with an unavoidable Mythos shock.  The important stuff is left to roleplay and maybe some fixed quantities, with most of the die rolls covering less important stuff.<br/><br/>And, of course, <b>GURPS</b> is a tool you can use when you're down to decide on your own what's important in your game.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, all of these approaches are viable, and all have their pitfalls.<br/><br/>Some of the responses in this thread have gone for some version of "roll if it's important".  I gotta say, as a designer, that's an appealingly concrete M.O.!  Maybe it's one of the more reliable ways to do things -- maybe <i>the</i> most reliable.  Just look at Burning Wheel!  At the same time, it's not the only functional way to do things, and tends not to be my favorite as a player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302616/#Comment_302616" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T13:12:50+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  1:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Heh, yeah, the old "roleplaying<i>toy</i>versus roleplaying<i>game</i>" conundrum.
