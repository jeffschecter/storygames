<i>(Standard disclamer: This has probably been discussed before. Links to existing threads - here or elsewhere - highly welcome.)</i><br/><br/>After reading the Forge for a year and now Story Games for some weeks I am slowly starting to bend with the wind. Bits and pieces of a game design have started colliding in my head. One major thing is that I would like to make a game that is about something important to me, but wrap it in an entertaining, metaphorical  package. My hope and expectation is that the underlying metaphor would guide my design decisions and lend additional depth to the resulting game.<br/><br/>Before I embark on the grand journey, I have some questions about using metaphors as a game design technique.
<ul>
<li>Which games do you know that are actually metaphors for something else?<br/></li><li>Have you seen this discussed in the game text or only by the author in some forum or other?<br/></li><li>How did knowing or not knowing about the metaphorical nature of the game affect your play?<br/></li></ul>
If you have designed a game as a metaphor for something else:
<ul>
<li>Why?<br/></li><li>How did it affect the design process?<br/></li><li>How strict were you in maintaining the correspondence between the underlying concepts and the resulting game design?<br/></li><li>Did you strive to keep the underlying metaphor secret? If so, why?<br/></li></ul>
My expectation is that mainstream games have had little use for metaphors, but that a number of Indie games might have had the opportunity to use them productively. For example, Ben Lehman has <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18293.0" rel="nofollow">stated</a> that the declining zeal and the increasing weariness of protagonists in <i>Polaris</i> can actually be seen as a metaphor for modern-day activism and losing your ideals.<br/><br/>Questions specifically for Ben:<br/>You have said somewhere that Polaris started with a setting that was a bit on the static side, so you added demons. Therefore I assume that the metaphor for activism was not an initial basis for the design, but added at some later point, around the time you added the demons and designed the mechanics. Could you discuss that process and the related design decisions a bit?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>+ Mikael                </div>

                            I'm going to be deeply unhelpful in this thread.<br/>
<br/>
Why?  Because I don't think in terms of metaphor as I design, or as I play, or as I write, or as I engage in any creative act.  I can easily understand the metaphors after the fact, of course.<br/>
<br/>
The process of unleashing demons onto the setting of Polaris was not at all interesting: It was just that I decided that my simplistic teenage fantasy world needed to be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Only after I'd written the game rules and played a few times did I realize the metaphors in the setting around trauma, activism, and faith.<br/>

                            Not unhelpful, Ben. Not that you said it, but it makes me think that getting too attached to the metaphor might choke the actual system. What if I make design decisions based on the underlying ideas, and the resulting system is not fun to play <i>unless</i> you understand the metaphor? Or maybe not fun even if you <i>do</i> know about it, because the issue is not something that interests you?<br/><br/>Well, anyway, pointers to metaphor-driven game designs are still highly appreciated. And if there's none, hey, new frontiers!                        </div>

                            You mean something like this, from an <a href="http://www.imagonem.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=7" rel="nofollow">interview</a>?<br/><br/>"Sorcerer is based on a single idea: that people get power through dysfunctional relationships, but that power is potentially destructive to the wielder's own worth. It's a puzzle: you want something because you value it, but to get it, you reduce your own value. This theme, especially when the dysfunctional relationship is symbolized as a powerful metaphysical being with its own agenda, is found in all of literature and mythology, across all human cultures, and throughout human history. You can feel its power yourself, regardless of your own beliefs, simply by using the word <i>demon</i> in a sentence. There is no other word quite like it."<br/><br/>It's funny how the brain works - or does not work, in this case. I had read the above and not noticed the explicit metaphorical nature of the design.<br/><br/>I will branch this discussion to <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19427.0" rel="nofollow">Forge</a>, but comments on this thread are still more than welcome.                        </div>

                            They're all metaphors.<br/>
<br/>
Now, sometimes the players don't realize it; sometimes the author doesn't realize it until after s/he's designed the game (e.g. Ben with ); sometimes the author never realizes it at all. But if a game were merely about something interesting happening to imaginary people with no relevance to the players' lives, the players probably wouldn't get into it all that intensely.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, look at Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Game of mythic fantasy and heroic quests, right? Well, sort of, except that in your standard "Hero's Journey," the protagonist leaps straight from being some farmboy to being thrown into some cosmic conflict to being the person whose choices decide that conflict (Hello, Luke Skywalker! Hello, Krishna! Hello, even, Jesus of Nazareth!). In D&amp;D, there is a lot of emphasis on the slow, steady steps from being a low-level weenie to ultimate uber-ness, and what gets you there is not dramatic moral decisions but clever tactical choices, good luck, and sheer persistence along the way. Plus everything, but everything, is measured numerically, from your experience (XPs, levels) to your magic powers (spell levels, "charges") to your hardiness (HPs) to the quality of your equipment (gold pieces, armor class, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
So what's D&amp;D  a metaphor for?<br/>
<br/>
I'd argue it's about being a hard-working middle class white guy in the USA in the second half of the twentieth century: Yeah, high school is boring and your first job sucks, but if you stick with it and show you have what it takes, eventually you'll rack up the right numbers and have a corner office and a big car! Or even your own company! Until then, you can practice your math skills and build your mental endurance at the same time as you daydream of greater power by playing D&amp;D!<br/>
<br/>
The Storyteller/White Wolf games are a different metaphor, arguably about being a bright, geeky kid in high school or a drifting twenty-something in the 80s: Yes, everyone else thinks they know what's important and cool and ignores us, but in fact we're in on the secret that makes us truly cool and important! (The text for  makes this really frickin' obvious).<br/>
<br/>
N.B.: I saw this first on the Forge but I decided to answer it here. As I understand the Forge's rules, when you post in "First Thoughts" you're supposed to be offering something specific about your own game, however half-baked it may be (though you could send a PM to Ron Edwards to be sure). Whereas this forum has no problem with "hey, how did other people do this?"                        </div>

                            Heh, Sydney, thanks. That certainly was a fresh perspective on D&amp;D, to me and probably someone else as well. <br/><br/>But, entertaining as such post-analysis is, I am most interested in games where the metaphor is used as a <i>design tool</i>, consciously and from the beginning. If nothing else, I could explain the time spent on game design as an artistic expression of one of the great philosophical questions of all times, when next interrogated by the S.P.O.U.S.E. anti-gaming terrorists.<br/><br/>As to the right forum to post stuff, I try to be a good little netizen, I do, but it seems to be so hard to find the correct site, let alone the correct forum for these questions.                        </div>

                            Weird.  I tend to use "game" as a metaphor for how the world works in general.  In understanding any system I find it useful to treat it as a game with players.  And sometimes I think "gee, that'd be fun" or at least interesting at a table.<br/>
<br/>
And, I think, that if there's something a game can teach me is how it feels to be a member of that exchange.  I tend to feel that the metaphorical content of a game is very different to the metaphor in other media - because really the game is a process, not a stasis, so it's metaphors should be of processes.                        </div>

                            Hey, Mikael.  Sydney's got the right of it, and how metaphor is present everywhere.  Using it explicitly front-loaded is, well, problematic.  Not impossible, but it creates its own problems, as you've outlined above.<br/><br/>The primary problem as I see it is that if you're approaching a game as a metaphor for something else, you're practicing ideological design.  The problem part of that is that we're often pretty dead-set when it comes to our ideology, and it's all too easy to push your ideology onto your players in less-than-fun ways.  You get DragonQuest or similar games, where the only way for players to succeed is to ideologically agree with the designer.  That's very often unfun, even when you already agree with the designer, because you don't have the ability to interpret anything; you're playing a script.<br/><br/>It's not insoluable, however.  If you approach your own ideology with a good bit of skepticism, framing things more as "X is important to examine" rather than "X must happen in exact this way," you allow for that interpretation to take place.  Instead of stating your opinion and forcing players to agree, you are opening a dialogue with your players and facilitating dialogue at the table.  This can lead to <em>awesome</em> gameplay -- this is how <em>Sorcerer</em>, <em>Capes</em>, and <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> all work.<br/><br/>In answer to your specific question, one of Dog's baseline concepts is that characters develop through conflict.  When I play Dogs, I make fallout-whores who are designed to get into conflicts and accrue tons of fallout.  Which definitely creates a certain timbre of game experience.<br/><br/>In my own design work, both <em>Conquer the Horizon</em> and <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> are weighted with some heavy metaphors for the imperialism of our history.  The difference, however, is that the mechanics of CtH force you to forward an imperialist agenda in your game; in FLFS,  I just swapped aliens for brown people and let the players choose how to deal with them.  Now, I don't think CtH is "bad design" per se, but it does emphasize and reward one style of play over another.  FLFS, on the other hand, allows you to flag whether or not you want to be a tool of the Empire or an anti-imperialist or not care one way or the other.                        </div>

                            First, context: in FLFS, there are two alien races, Venerians and Martians.  Venerians are servile, "uncivilized", and used as indentured servants (slaves).  Martians are a race fallen from fomer glory, disinterested in human culture and resistent to being exploited.  So, in broad strokes (the only strokes I provide), you've got your two basic kinds of non-Europeans in the imperialist world view of the time.<br/><br/>In writing the sections for the two races, I gave some high-color evocative examples of their behavior (Venerians as chaotic rioting barbarians and as subdued, civilized servants; Martians as aloof and mysterious), and some very light mechanics (Venerians get a bonus when brachiating or swimming and a penalty when in dry environments, which makes them struggle to be "as human" as the humans; Martians get a bonus for 'aura-reading' and a penalty for making any sense whatsoever to humans, which gives them lots of information they can't adequately express).  Most of the "design work" was in situating the races in the default setting, though, and nearly all of it is open to player interpretation rather than didactic.<br/><br/>I don't discuss the metaphor anywhere in FLFS, for a couple reasons.  First, for this book, I don't see it as particularly appropriate.  It's not a game that's supposed to produce deep, meaningful, existential analyses of the human condition.  It's not a game of subtleties; it's all broad strokes and vibrant color.  Secondly, as it is a very open-ended game, I think that any discussion of "the metaphor of this game is X" will predetermine a lot of play and reduce the breadth of possibilities available.  And lastly, given that the intended audience is not exclusively Forge twunts, I don't expect that they'd be very interested in playing for another page or two of material they don't care about.  That's what blogs are for. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            bq. Judson, I do not understand what you are saying. Either we are speaking of two slightly different things, or you are on a too high-meta-professional level for me.<br/>
<br/>
I somehow doubt that.  I play a lot of board games, and never-enough RPGs and I think the concept of game-rules has infected me enough that, say, when I'm listening to NPR, I try to figure out how the game works.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, there's been a lot of talk about insurance and medicine recently.  I completely see a broken game where the pharmaceutical companies are twinking the system and nobody's getting in their way, because the lawmakers are a part of the huge game of Gnomic we call a democracy.  So the incentives for the players lead to the condition we're in, and the only way I can see to fix the issue is to change the rules - but instead we're still trying to trade Wood for Sheep.  <br/>
<br/>
So while I do see the "should I introduce an element into the premise of my game that's metaphoric" question - well, I see it as a pretty easy one.  If your game is about "the uncertainty of life," then a metaphor of some kind is probably in order.  <br/>
<br/>
Hell, I'd even say, (and really would like to see) that a game about "how white people and imperialism has really sucked for brown people" would be really interesting.  But that the ideological high-horsesness comes in if you don't set up a _real_ conflict in your premise.  If you say "whitey is evil," from the outset, then you're eventually writing a really boring game.  Same thing if you say "darky deserved it."  But if you write a game about imperialism and how problematic it is, and how usually white people were the imperialists, but make a point of the exceptions, I think **that** would be a really cool game.  And you probably would want to dress it in at least a little bit of a metaphor.  For instance, as a white gentile male, I usually get a little tetchy about most race/gender based stories.  But _Maus_ is enough of a separation for me to get into without self-conciousness. <br/>
<br/>
What I mean about _games_ as metaphors, is that I think that the act of playing a game is very different from reading a book or watching a movie, and as such the metaphors of a game should be different than the metaphors of a film.  That aliens are "brown people" is a weak game metaphor.  But if the game actually works towards incentivizing imperialism, then your players find themselves being imperialistic, and they begin to ask themselves, from the point of view of the imperialists, "is this wrong?" "is there another way?"  It's very easy to point the finger and say "Evil!" but harder to say how to go another way.                        </div>

                            Dogs has other sources.  I don't want to speak for Vincent too much here, but I there's certainly a lot of personal history involved.  Additionally, it's simply an incredibly straightforward implementation of "force players to take moral stances."  It doesn't need that metaphorical weight; it achieves its impact by much more straightfoward means. ;)                        </div>

                            It's also neat that nowadays we're beginning to get roleplaying games that are metaphors/allegories for... roleplaying.  The most prominent example is probably Rebecca Borgstrom's work on <i>Exalted: The Fair Folk</i> but arguments could be made for others.                        </div>

                            And, Sydney, I was not saying that games shouldn't have a strong metaphor for their central premise.  But if the premise is "I think that Nazis were evil," no amount of metaphor is going to help you.  But if your premise is "Life in Nazi Germany was terrifying, awful, but even so almost any generalization you can make is ultimately wrong." and you cast mice as Jews and cats as Germans, then you win a Pulitzer.<br/>
<br/>
What I was saying is that the trap of a strong ideological premise is that you're prone to make a statement, and disguise the statement in metaphor.  An RPG should probably (although not absolutely) ask a question as it's premise, rather than make a statement.  And it's hard to ask questions about an ideological concern, because by virtue of the ideology, we tend to take stands and pick sides.  And a game that's written like that is ultimately a screed, and usually boring.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs is a perfect example here (like so many places.)  Part of the reason that Dogs is so interesting a game is that it does not give you answers, only tools to build questions.  You bring the answers to the table, and you fight them out with the metaphor of crazy non-at-all-Mormons point guns everywhere and burning things down.                        </div>

                            Thanks guys, interesting stuff.<br/><br/>A concrete example would seem to be in place, lest we drift too far in to the realm of ideological premises and such. I do not want to discuss my actual stuff yet, it is still too raw and tender, but let's just take a random example.<br/><br/>Let's say that "it's all about school", and just because I am a nerdy geek I select, as a metaphor or the overt setting, an exploratory mission of the Common United Space Forces.<br/><br/>Because I think school was mostly really boring, and all the exciting stuff happened during breaks/recesses, I am immediately imagining a game where most of the stuff happens in the ready room, between on-duty periods. The on-duty periods, when the characters serve on the bridge or the engine room or whatever, would be nearly not played at all, maybe covered by a single die roll to check whether you goofed up and got reprimanded by your superior or whatever. The focus would thus be on the breaks, and the mechanics would focus on the social relationships of the characters, and their need to unwind, relax and blow some steam so that they can take the stress of their next on-duty period. High stress levels and backfiring pranks would lead to fights etc. Planetary exploration would be a metaphor for school field trips, consisting mostly of boring travel and boring mechanical tasks, with the focus being on the one troublemaker who is inciting some of the "good characters" to do something bad like smoke drugs behind that boulder over there.<br/><br/>... And so on, with the metaphor used as a guide to the design. While this example is not very exiting, it is also definitely not ideological in nature, and I do not think that it would pre-answer any questions.<br/><br/>The premise of the game would be a different thing, something weak like "How do you cope with constant stress combined with incessant boredom?" in this case.<br/><br/>So, if this were an actual design, and school would be the underlying idea, would I state that openly in the game text?                        </div>

<code>You mean something like this, from an interview?<br/><br/>"Sorcerer is based on a single idea: that people get power through dysfunctional relationships, but that power is potentially destructive to the wielder's own worth. It's a puzzle: you want something because you value it, but to get it, you reduce your own value. This theme, especially when the dysfunctional relationship is symbolized as a powerful metaphysical being with its own agenda, is found in all of literature and mythology, across all human cultures, and throughout human history. You can feel its power yourself, regardless of your own beliefs, simply by using the word demon in a sentence. There is no other word quite like it."<br/><br/>It's funny how the brain works - or does not work, in this case. I had read the above and not noticed the explicit metaphorical nature of the design.<br/><br/>I will branch this discussion to Forge, but comments on this thread are still more than welcome.</code><br/><br/>That's not a Metaphor, it's a Moral. There is no allegory here, nothing that speaks of something else.<br/>It's all there in the clear.<br/><br/>Edit: To be clear, the Demon is a metaphor, but the fact about power is a moral.                        </div>
