What's its USP? Well, from what I can gather, it's mainly the fact that it's designed to work with iOS, Android, Mac, Windows and... whatever that penguin icon represents (anyone enlighten me there?).<br/><br/>What I'd like to know is, what makes it different from Obsidian Portal and Roll20 etc.? Is it the platform-independentness? Still, why would you choose it over OP and R20? Also, why such a large price tag-$96'000? Sure, this kind of tech don't come cheap, but then if that's the thinking, surely they'd need $100s of '000s, not just a measly $96'000? And what exactly is this 'scutwork' they're claiming to obviate?<br/><br/>I'm interested in this because I'm just about to take my first steps into online gaming, via G+, which seems a perfectly adequate platform, but if the gaming experience provided by creators such as the ones behind this KS is likely to be so much better, I need to know about it, as I suspect the greater part of my gaming in future is likely to be via the Internet. (True, I'm mainly talking about playing games with my buddies over Hangouts than online games per se, but still...).<br/><br/>Thoughts?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427799/#Comment_427799" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T11:38:22+00:00" title="January 30, 2014 11:38AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Penguin is Linux.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427800/#Comment_427800" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T11:52:53+00:00" title="January 30, 2014 11:52AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2014 12:06PM by James_Stuart.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's using Unity, which is a cross-platform game engine. <br/><br/>It's not the clearest at exactly what it is, but the closest comparison seems to be Neverwinter Nights. It's taking a ruleset (In NWN, D&amp;D, in this example, an unpublished design by Robin Laws), and making a set of tools for running a game in this ruleset. The GM is given tools like scripting and creating NPCs, tilesets, and such.<br/><br/>There's a lot that's weird about this: it's not designed around online play (see the FAQ), so unless they reach a hastily-added stretch goal, you'd have to be running your own voice thing. (Reasonable on a computer, trickier to work well on phones). Unless this has magically solved a lot of very difficult UI problems, it'll probably require a bunch of prep to do anything but pre-canned adventures, and be hard to improvise at the speed of face-to-face play when they go off (other than simple things like: "Uh, two orcs appear!"). The KS doesn't mention whether it's real-time or turn based. <br/><br/>So, it's a computer multi-player RPG that requires a device for all players (most likely, for face-to-face games), that comes with a bunch of GM tools for creation, that'd you probably need to use in prep to be effective. Lots of people did get a lot of fun out of NWN and NWN2 for sure, but I'm not sure why the pitch isn't oriented that direction instead of at tabletop roleplayers.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427808/#Comment_427808" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T12:33:16+00:00" title="January 30, 2014 12:33PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that NWN was partly sold as a game that would potentially allow one to play in a PNP way-- which, for me at least, wasn't quite true. Still very cool game, though-- specially if you like to tinker with the toolset. Many people created persistent worlds with it too. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427815/#Comment_427815" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T14:27:39+00:00" title="January 30, 2014  2:27PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The computer game <i>Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption</i> had a similar multiplayer option to NWN, which allowed one player to act as the game master. I recall hearing that this was very popular among WoD fans. I never really tried it in either game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
