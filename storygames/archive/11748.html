This means I get some good stuff (like <a href="http://www.darksiders.com/" rel="nofollow">Darksiders</a>) and miss some other stuff on the PC end, like the game <a href="http://www.metro2033game.com/" rel="nofollow">Metro 2033</a>.  I don't know about you, but the synopsis of <i>Metro 2033</i> as presented on <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/" rel="nofollow">Metacritic</a> just <i>screams</i> roleplay to me.\n<blockquote>Set in the shattered subway of a post apocalyptic Moscow, Metro 2033 is a story of intensive underground survival where the fate of mankind rests in your hands. In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the earth\u2019s surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside.<br/><br/>You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised Underground. Having never ventured beyond your Metro Station-City limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure if this would make for a better <a href="http://lumpley.com/apocalypse/" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a> game or something else entirely.  I'm sure some of you already have your wheels turning on this thing.  I recently acquired a copy of <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=70124" rel="nofollow">Atomic Highway</a> and, from the basics I've been able to glean, it might do the trick, too.  Or maybe there's no need to go the strictly post-apocalyptic route and just use another system that can reflect a world of peril and exploration.  Like <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago II</a> maybe?  I offer this last as pure speculation because I don't know if that well, but if you can do <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11483" rel="nofollow">subway dogs of Moscow</a> it seems like you could do subway-dwelling Muscovites, too.<br/><br/>Anyway, whaddaya think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
