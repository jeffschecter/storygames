I shot your character dead!<br/>Sam:  No way.  I was totally wearing my bullet proof vest.  Also, my dude is fast enough to dodge bullets.<br/>Ted:  But my dude is a crack shot!<br/><br/>In this example, the usefulness of a combat resolution system is apparent.  Sam will want his character's vest and his ability to dodge bullets to have mechanical significance.  Ted will want his character's crack shot attribute to have mechanical significance.  Once the individual weights of those attributes is agreed on both Sam and Ted can resolve the issue:  <i>Is Sam's character shot and dead?</i><br/><br/>Stick with me.<br/><br/>Ted:  My character chooses his love for Martha over his loyalty to your character.<br/>Sam:  [Insert amazing bit of RP where Sam's character tries to change Ted's character's mind]<br/>Ted:  Nope.  There is just no way my dude can be convinced.  He's going with Martha.<br/>Sam:  But my awesome role playing!  There's no way your character could ignore that situation!<br/><br/>Now, in this example, you've got to imagine just a tad harder.  You have to accept the assumption that each player sees how 'obvious' it is that their character is right and that the <i>other </i>character must bend.  Without a social conflict resolution system someone is going to feel cheated.  <br/><br/>But why, I thought, were we (meaning me and all my old groups dating back to HS) able to negotiate our way through so many excellent RP sessions without a single roll for social activity?  <br/><br/>Ding!  Lightbulb!<br/><br/>That classic rule that says a player is the captain of their PC?  Yeah.  That's a "Yes, and..." / "Yes, but..."  rule for social interactions.  See what I mean?  The player gets to say anything they want about who their character is and what they think and why they think it.  Everyone else, GM included, only gets to respond with agreement.  Anything else is treated as crappy playing.  Especially when it comes from the GM.<br/><br/>It's really just an authority thing, isn't it?  In the classic negotiation method if I decide my character hates tacos then you have to deal with it.  You have to accept that you have no authority to make my character like tacos.  You cannot use the system to force my character to enjoy a taco.  Ok, maybe you can force my character to <i>eat </i>a taco, but you can't force him to like it.<br/><br/>So, is there any value in negotation over social conflict resolution, or vice-versa?  At first I was inclined to say that it's just a matter of taste.  But now I think that the social negotation system may just have one little flaw.  It comes up pretty often, but most folks (myself included) tend to mistake those moments of system breakdown for moments of player dickishness.  These are the moments when one character's internal programming comes into conflict with another's.  <br/><br/>Sam:  My character would never leave a baby monster alive.  It's the wrong thing to do.<br/>Ted:  My character cannot abide by the slaughter of innocents.  It doesn't matter if they are monsters or not.  It's wrong.<br/><br/>If neither player can manage to find negotiating room for their character's convictions and there isn't a social conflict resolution sytem in place, then that probably means that there are two possible ways the issue will turn out.  The two players may have their characters use the combat system to hash it out.  But since PCs killing PCs is a taboo all it's own in classic gaming, that seems unlikey to happen.  The more likely outcome is that the authority figure will have to step in.  The GM.  He, or she, will have to make a decision about who wins the conflict between the two characters.  The inevitable result is that the loosing player will feel cheated.  After all, neither one of them agreed to a game where their character's convictions could be so easily pushed aside.  But there it is.  Someone had to move.<br/><br/>Therefore, it's my position that some form of explicit social conflict rule is superior to the negotiation system.  If only just for this one problem.  When players get into a game with the assumptions that their character's internal wiring can never be challenged or altered by outside circumstances, eventually two characters will find themselves butting heads.  That's a formula for a train wreck.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94708/#Comment_94708" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T11:26:17+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 11:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This where I think Sorcerer really excels.  It both measures the outcome of social conflicts AND doesn't restrict player sovereignty of character.  Consider your example of the two arguing over the life of the baby monster.  Instead of two players arguing at the table for half an hour your just roll Will vs. Will.  Let's say Ted comes out on top.  <br/><br/>However, Sam is really committed to killing the baby monster.  Sam can't continue to argue with Ted that issue has been resolved.  However, he can try to kill the baby monster, try to kidnap the baby monster whatever.  Ted can try to stop him AND gets his victory dice from the social conflict as a bonus for doing so justified as Sam's hesitancy or Ted's clear vigilance over the baby monster or whatever fits.<br/><br/>Social conflict resolution in Sorcerer a) keeps the game from bogging down with lots of player arguing "in character" (something I personally hate) b) measures the impact of that conflict on follow up conflicts and c) retains player charcter sovereignty.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94716/#Comment_94716" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T11:37:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 11:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a very near and dear issue to me since I play with a combination of "my control over my character is absolute" sorts and those who have "very high social skill characters" who expect to be effective with it.  To avoid repeating too much, my thoughts as posted elsewhere:<br/><br/>~ in a "story game" where needs of story are to come before "my guyism", I think there are types of story that require characters to be "persuadable to things they will regret", "Character mistakes" that weren't "Player mistakes".<br/><br/>~ the idea from the Grimm SotC thread of social skill success meaning the subject furnishes the explanation of "what would convince them" even to the extent of authoring facts in the shared imaginary space is cool, per the comment there that could be subject to rejoinder of confirmation that "the successful social skill soruce would do that".<br/><br/>~ some way of melding "story flows reflecting character abilities" with "player control" is a possible compromise whether it's player always controls ability to have 2nd thoughts or the Sorcerer idea above, another possibility I have toyed with is saying "okay, your character is not convinced to untie the subject despite the social skill roll saying they were, but the price of defying the social skill mechanic is that an alternate fiction is authored explaining how they got untied anyway ~ in short you control what your character thought and acted on, but if in contradiction to system that doesn't actually change what goes on in the game reality, even if it's just the ropes burst, they slipped out of them, whatever."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
