My favorite of which was a copy of The Traveller Book, a compilation of the first few volumes of the original Traveller. I'd read through Mongoose Traveller and MegaTraveller before, each leaving me feeling like they were on the border of sheer brilliance, but falling ever so short.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, that was because they were trying to fix what wasn't broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's fascinating, because it's one of the few games of the era that clearly explains exactly how it expects the 'Referee' to run and make decisions. There's some weird complicated travel time rules, and I highly doubt most folks are going to map the gravity levels of every planetary body, but they are by the exception not the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's even made me reevaluate how I look at numbers in games. For instance, y'know how lots of indie games use descriptor to sign post narration? Well, that seems to be how most of traveller's stats work. I've yet to find how they affect any of the rolls, except for character creation and the requisite bonus attack for strength. But it seems mostly a narrative device, and that was pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe planetary generation is awesome, although that's pretty commonly known. What I didn't know before reading the book however was the weird results you sometimes get are intentional. It actually talks about illogical planets as an opportunity for the Referee to be imaginative. It's very reminescent of how Oracles work in In a Wicked Age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep thinking of how you could drift the procedures a little bit to give it more player involvement. Even little details like as the PCs check their library data on a world, asking Apocalypse World questions, or flat out just have people make up some details.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, this game is awesome, and just reading the book makes me want to run a game of it <i>right now</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334727/#Comment_334727" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T18:39:30+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  6:39PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we go to conventions, my brother and I enjoy playing what we call "pick-up Traveller." We roll up a miniature sub-sector (6-10 worlds or so) together so that instead of lonely fun world creation becomes this awesome collaborative brainstorming exercise. Then one of us becomes the referee and the other one rolls up a character. Sometimes we rope other people into playing. The last time we did it, another player and I were trying to rescue an alien prince from indentured servitude on a planet with an insidious atmosphere; we wound up on the run from space marines. I got away, my partner got 24 years for criminal trespass and manslaughter.
