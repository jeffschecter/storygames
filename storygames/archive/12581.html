(<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dct676c8_30fs5mm7" rel="nofollow">Previously...</a>)<br/><br/>This time, the pilgrims answered the letter "<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dct676c8_30fs5mm7" rel="nofollow">Everything Has a Voice</a>" by Kirk Mitchell. The story of what happens next is translated by Fabio Succi Cimentini. Here's what happened:\n<blockquote>ROUND 1<br/><br/>FABIO; 2 Black <br/>ST: In the midst of the night, Ikuna catches a glimpse of a figure on the Spires, that is Cam's youngest son.<br/>TM: But a deep fog rises and gets her lost.<br/><br/>ARIELE: 3 White <br/>ST: Lani is on the cliffs, where sea crashes on land, and listens to the cause of the war between ocean and forest. <br/><br/>BRUNO: 2 White<br/>ST: Kaki lands on the beach, raises his hands and calms down the trees.<br/>TM: Soon as he does, a sudden splash of waves submerges him and the land nearby.<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 2 White<br/>ST: Matareka dives into the ocean and reaches Cam's middle son.<br/>TM: But the boy does not want to come back to the land, as he is married and with (merman) children<br/><br/>MARIO: 0 White<br/>TM: As he reaches the tribes, Taranga becomes the center of a struggle between factions to have him on either side.<br/><br/>ROUND 2<br/><br/>ARIELE: 2 Black<br/>ST: The Ocean screams vengeance for something stolen from him and hidden in the Forest.<br/>TM: But the watery hand which speaks to Lani is crushing him.<br/><br/>BRUNO: 0 White<br/>TM: The Forest draws Kaki deep into itself, and the furios Ocean crosses its boundaries.<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 2 Black<br/>ST: Matareka frees Cam's middle son from the siren's songs, which reveals the bride and children as an illusion<br/>TM: But the sea denizen attacks you.<br/><br/>MARIO: 1 White<br/>TM: Whereas the faction were just argiung over Taranga, now they pick up weapons and fight.<br/>ST: The more the Pilgrim is beaten in the midst of the battle, the more he inflates, until he becomes sufficiently large to stop the fight.<br/><br/>FABIO: 1 White<br/>TM: As she's wrapped up in fog, Ikuna knocks against a Spire , which starts to resonate with a devastating shrike, which could shatter her crystal eyes.<br/>ST: Grabbing the only sounding one of the silent Spires, she herself resonates calming down the noise and guiding Cam's son to her.<br/><br/>ROUND 3<br/>BRUNO: 3 White<br/>ST: Kaki calms down the barbs with his touch, and now the Forest is willing to talk.<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 3 White<br/>ST: The siren-monster is beaten, and Matareka can carry the boy back on land.<br/><br/>FABIO: 2 White<br/>ST: Cam's son explains to kuna that he went to the Spires to ask what he has to do about the disputed object, which is kept in a chest.<br/>TM: But he's not willing to leave the Spires as doing so he would betray his brother... the thief.<br/><br/>ARIEL: 1 White<br/>TM: [Same trouble as before]<br/>ST: Lani bites the watery hand, then uses leverage to jump over the face and dive into it.<br/><br/>ROUND 4<br/><br/>FRANCESCA: 0 White <br/>TM: Alas! The breaking of the siren's spell has stolen the boy's breath.<br/><br/>MARIO: 3 Black<br/>ST: Taranga listens to the villager, and finally finds out from Cam the Listener that the balance in the world started to fall apart when his oldest son was turned down by the most beautiful maiden of the village and he left.<br/><br/>FABIO: 2 Black<br/>ST: The sea still rages and the Spires seem about to fall, so the boy can't reject Ikuna's helping hand and follows her.<br/>TM: But the sea could shatter their boat on the cliffs!<br/><br/>ARIELE: 2 White<br/>ST: Lani manages to find out that the stolen object is the Sea Heart, and it was stolen for the love of the Forest towards the Sea.<br/>TM: And so the Forest attacks him to stop him<br/><br/>BRUNO: 3 Black<br/>ST: In the midst of the Forest, Cam's oldest son bursts in, crying and willing to repent.</blockquote>\nFabio concludes:\n<blockquote>Unfortunately we were in Bruno's car when narrating Parades and the second Avatar changes, so I didn't write the m down, but essentially the baance was restored with the beautiful girl impressed by the First Son's rash but courageous and loving actions, the cutting of the Sea Heart in two to celebrate a marriage between sea and earth, and eventual peace.</blockquote>\nThe group some further comments about the game that are very useful to me as I revisit the text and the game mechanics in the coming months. I can share those, too, if you're morbidly curious. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
