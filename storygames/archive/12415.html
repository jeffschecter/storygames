The setting is Depression-era Chicago, the main character Chase Laurent, a sorcerous detective with a murderous past.<br/><br/> Throughout the game, my brother's normally been pointing me in something's direction and having me describe it.  "OK, I open the door.  What do I find?"  However, while investigating the villain's abandoned mansion, we find a skeleton that Chase's archeologist sidekick says dates all the way back to Assyria.  My brother says "OK, I pull out a knife and cut open one of the skeleton's ribs.  What do I find?"<br/><br/> I just stare at him blankly.  "I don't know, you tell me."  <br/><br/> He looks at me like "My gosh, this is so obvious.  Of course the skeleton's bones are full of the black slime we've been finding at the crime scenes and that's left behind by the villain's supernatural hit man!"  <br/><br/> I love it when the players go "You know what, GM, you're story's lame.

I was a Troll Slayer Dwarf with a Great Axe.  Overall, it was pretty awesome.  We liked character creation and advancement a lot.  Combat felt like 4E had been injected with a ton of Savage Worlds, Agon, and Danger Patrol, which suited us just fine, but we only got to see what it looked liked against solo adversaries, so we're excited to try it out against more complex challenges to see how it holds up.  The non-combat challenges seem to have the dread "Skill Challenge Disease" where they're pretty dramatically underdeveloped compared to fighting, but still aren't totally useless.  In general, just watching Sage run it, it looked way easier to run than 4E, but Sage says that there are even fewer guidelines on how to set up conflicts that are appropriately challenging, so I'd have to read it to know for sure.<br/><br/>Overall, though, a pretty impressive achievement in both game and product design.  I want to play more if it to find out what it can really do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279184/#Comment_279184" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T01:27:36+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  1:27AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2010 1:39AM by Teataine.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel yesterday. For a change I sat back and played, which I haven't done in a while. My GM instincts are skill kicking but it's a good change of perspective I think. Anyway...<br/><br/>We had a couple of hours for world burning. We used Judd's "Make your own New Crobuzon" method and came up with a city in which Sahuagin clean the sewers and the canals and work the docks as the oppresses underclass, Rakasha are basically immigrants working as entertainers, and Genies have long ago been bound and trapped in the city itself by powerful wizards (you can rub a lamp post and ask for help). There's a storm elemental trapped in a building, functioning as a power plant, a cabal of Beholders working from the shadows and the dark alleyways are haunted by Chokers. There's also a serial killer Chain Devil lurking around. Then we burned characters. I got an urchin that's always on the run, both from a corrupt constable and other urchins, then a young boy that ran from home to become a sailor to earn his bread and a former slave, now prostitute (my urchin has a "She's the mother I never had." belief with her.) Burning itself was extremely fun. I hope the game turns out alright, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279244/#Comment_279244" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T19:48:44+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  7:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco: Old West playset<br/><br/>I played Zheng Zheng, a beautiful con artist posing as a Chinese mail-order bride.

This would create lots of distractions, the perfect cover for them to...well to do what, though?<br/><br/>Seriously, that was it. The second part of the plan just never materialized.

The people (even the ones we liked, tragically) have been decimated by the Arazecki Hordes, and the last capitol standing is Lookshy, to the North. We have an army of 150,000 soldiers led by the violent and impatient Earth aspected Gaius Britannicus to crush this last rebellion against the Realm. Our goal? To achieve victory, but simultaneously leave some of the culture of the 100 Kingdoms intact. How? Keep the pyschopath Britannicus from murdering them all, and make it look like we're not trying to do that at all.<br/><br/>After numerous near massacres are prevented over and over the whole way North, we finally reach our destination: the borders of Lookshy. Kyu-du, our Dragon Blood, helms a political assault against the merchant lands, persuading them to lay down arms. Our assassin, Gemborrah, lays a settlement to waste with hungry ghosts at his beck and call. Mnemon Tatsumi, with 5,000 mercenary troops under her command, assaults a nearby port fortress with unconventional tactics in order to allow the Navy passage to the city. And with a deceptive spell our Thumaturge Jun-shur turns all of the leaders of Lookshy's military force against each other in a bloody fight for power. <br/><br/>But in the end? <b>We lost.</b> They had an essence nuke that obliterated Britannicus's army and our forces as well.

He'd found a cache of documents on black ops during the Korean War and was being blackmailed for them by the Mook, Choi, a deluded South Korean with a plan to get rich by selling the documents to the North Korean government. But the Boss was Rey Lattimore, another army buddy of Rolo's who just wanted to ruin Rolo by convincing him to betray his country and then inducing him to commit suicide.<br/><br/>I hooked the PCs because they decided their failed job was in North Korea, so with crazy Koreans running around, they had to investigate, but they kept saying funny things like: "Wait, the documents are 50 years old? Aren't they declassified by now?"<br/><br/>One of the best scenes was Lesley's provocateur specialist pretending to be from the mob, collecting rent from Choi on behalf of his landlord and seizing the documents as compensation. "We'll be back next month," said Lukas' agent, as they left.<br/><br/>In the end, with my Blowback move, Rolo and Lulu (the civilian girlfriend of David's ex-agent) ran off to South Korea to try to get the documents back, even though they'd been replaced with fake ones by the PCs.<br/><br/>All in all, pretty awesome.  We were a bit confused about the stress rules and missed one major aspect of Operations (that the Agency starts with base dice of 3 on all rolls), but otherwise things went relatively smoothly.  Definitely looking forward to playing it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280288/#Comment_280288" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T07:31:05+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  7:31AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More Apocalypse World last night.<br/><br/>In the face of a diminished water supply, White joins forces with Iris the Brainer and Ozair the Savvyhead to sell filtrated water at a huge profit.

Two highlights from last night's game:<br/><br/>1) So my character, Destinee, is married to her step-father Charles after her mother was killed by a drunk driver. She's finally cottoned on to the fact that Charles only married her because she looks like his mother, is pissed, and has started stripping to get revenge. She's in the middle of a pole dance when a process server comes in, sits in the front row, and serves divorce papers by stuffing them in her G-string. Cut to outside - Destinee storms out the back door, still wearing nothing but a g-string and 5-inch stilettoes, spots Charles sitting on a park bench across the street, and runs him over with her Escalade.<br/><br/>2) Earlier - Destinee winds up going home with Indian cop Balarama Khan, who coincidentally was the drunk that killed her mother. Stacie, Destinee's therapist and convicted sex offender, and Charles have teamed up to get revenge on Balarama. Stacie distracts Balarama by standing in the street out front of his house with a boom box blaring "In Your Eyes" while Charles sneaks around back and releases 100 feral cats into Balarama's house. When Stacie gets hit by a car, Charles panics and sets the house on fire. Balarama tries, but the flaming cats stop him from putting out the fire. His house burns down along with his green card. Destinee escapes with one of the cats, only slightly singed, whom she names Snuffles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282063/#Comment_282063" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T08:24:27+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  8:24AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What, no Klingon Sword?

His chin itched from the beard he was growing and the jumpsuit the Emigration Commission required for all extra-atmospheric flights was not at all comfortable. The boots zipped into the legs, something special for Martian flights, it kept out the Crawlies.<br/><br/>Kelly shook his head. That was something new. There\u2019d been rats in Venice, monkeys in Cairo and cockroaches in any number of places he\u2019d been in the last 13 years, but nothing as\u2026 aggressive as these things were supposed to be.<br/><br/>He and 65 other people were waiting for boarding to begin; each in their issued jumpsuits carrying or sitting beside their regulation duffles. Kelly had staked out a spot a few seats away from everyone else; there was plenty of seating since emigration requests had dropped of sharply of late. To his left there was a large screen showing images of the signing of the Kinshasa Treaty. On the screen, a Kelly Perkins in a business suit and designer sunglasses shook hands, posed for pictures and finally signed his name, binding the Earth Coalition and the Luba Liberte to the terms he\u2019d negotiated.<br/><br/>It was a raw deal for the Africans. The LL was getting a substantial step up from the conditions they\u2019d been operating under, but it was maybe 15% of what they\u2019d have gotten if they\u2019d been a part of the so-called \u201cfirst world\u201d. Still, the coltan would keep flowing and the worldwide communications network would stay online for another decade or so. That was what counted for the planet, and the planet was his boss. He had worked in substantial safety measures into the agreement, so life would improve for them. He\u2019d made sure of that, even if their leaders hadn\u2019t.<br/><br/>The next day he\u2019d gotten the call from Raleigh that he\u2019d be going to Mars in two weeks. No time for a vacation, no time to celebrate. In fact, if things in the Congo hadn\u2019t gone as quickly as they had, they might have pulled him to send him up. He\u2019d run quarantines and disease control for years at the American CDC before becoming the EC\u2019s chief negotiator, making him uniquely qualified to deal with the problems the Mars Colony was facing.<br/><br/>The screen changed, now showing an overhead map of the concourse with green arrows showign the boarding path. <i>Alright</i>, he thought, time to go to <i>Mars</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282564/#Comment_282564" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T22:07:40+00:00" title="July 22, 2010 10:07PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Lolita, a black teenaged prostitute being pimped by her own Mama on the mean streets of Oakland, circa 1972.

href="http://www.muramasathedemonblade.com/?fbid=mfaIf0Mc7lz" rel="nofollow">Oboro Muramasa</a>, GMing:<br/><br/>Travis' character, a Shinto priest named Kazu, has convinced a yakuza crime lord of a crossroads town to find some way of revealing the kugutsu's (Andy K) secrets (she has two - once a bloody killer along with the yakuza and the fact that she's a living doll). Only knowing the first secret, he travels deep into the mountains to retrieve a powerful kami (imaging a ox-sized white tiger with jade spears stuck into its back like quills on a porcupine) and piss it off so she'll be forced to save him and reveal herself. He feels she'll do so and they can travel together again. I describe his return as he whispers at the Shinto and mention his right arm is now blackened. I say the following: "The audience knows from other tales that it is frostbitten ..." Remember, this is Kabuki, the audience is probably quoting all the good lines as their said because they know the tales and anthologies backwards and forwards.<br/><br/>Email from player:<br/><br/>One technique Mark used that I think I'll add to my toolkit was "the audience." A few times he would say "the audience knows..." and I found it a nice way to communicate information we as players could know, for the purpose of the story, that our characters would not. Specifically, when he used it to indicate that Ginzu's arm was frostbitten, it was a nice, quick detail, rather than a longer flashback just for the audience's benefit. It was very easy to just fill in the gaps myself, imagining a scene we never saw, where Ginzu got frostbitten in his northern travels. So, succinct and effective.<br/><br/>I've been feeling awesome and proud for that ever since I got the email.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne" title="Shadowmourne"><img alt="Shadowmourne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/130/nQVJZC4DDIYSK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne">Shadowmourne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282726/#Comment_282726" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-24T03:54:56+00:00" title="July 24, 2010  3:54AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World last night: -<br/><br/>Ruby, waking up after having been unconscious for a week.

Below, Major Forge has got to the scene first on his steam-powered motorcycle. One saboteur drops down, but Forge shows him who's boss and smacks him off the ledge and into the drink with his warhammer. Above, Guild Alchemist Smith-Jones knocks the other from his perch with a blast of alchemically-driven air, but the backdraft blows the balloon off-course. Engineer Ada Locklearne jumps onto the bridge safely, but the Wing Commander can't keep the dirigible from slitting open its gasbag on the canyon wall. Ada defuses the bomb easily, but the balloon is in trouble. Smith-Jones uses more alchemy to hold the helium in as best he can, and Bartholomew-Smith puts the dirigible down safely. The Major helps Ada down from the bridge, heads to where the balloon ditched, just before the train thunders overhead.<br/><br/>Of course, now they have to deal with the problem of the balloon needing repairs, but being ditched in a nominally hostile country. And all from following up a side-plot they couldn't let slide...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282870/#Comment_282870" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T06:00:07+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  6:00AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We didn't get to play for very long, but in With Great Power the Shade has some flashbacks showing her as a member of the old Avengers-esque superhero team, the Guard, and her complex relationship Powerman (not the Luke Cage one).

in 1534 to prevent some monks from summoning Shub-Niggurath. They have evidence that they were the ones who stopped the ritual. <br/><br/>So when they arrive they check out the abbey and our alienist PC, now incarnated as an Irish prince, goes up to the Abbot and asks him if he knows of any monks plotting to summon an evil deity. 10 seconds later he jumps out of the window, pursued by said Abbot and his evil monks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283674/#Comment_283674" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T09:51:10+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  9:51AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Garrick, a gorilla death-mage from a land ruled by apes, takes on Leth, the God of Flowers.<br/><br/>Leth is forced by Garrick's aggresion onto the offense but has used most of his peak skills already in trying to defuse the situation. He leads with Srocery (7) which is a big mistake \u2014 Garrick still has his free to defend with and his is 5. That's a duel. That means everyone else is safe but that the two duellists will roll once and then trade consequences until one dies or concedes.<br/><br/>Leth rolls well and takes a consequence anyway to consolidate it. JB (Garrick) narrates "inside a zone of death" as Leth sucks the life from the land in order to use the power against Garrick.<br/><br/>Garrick takes a critical consequence to take the lead here and Brad (Leth) narrates "loses his soul to the Black Blade". Garrick has his foul sword out and is accelerating the death that Leth started. Whirls of spikey black corruption twist around both of them.<br/><br/>Leth offers a concession \u2014 you win, Garrick, and everyone knows you win. The fight is public and a god has kneeled before you. But Garrick is uninterested in glory or even victory. So Leth takes another consequence ("all the unicorns are dead") and, because he paid to act with a consequence, also free tags Garrick's soulessness. That brings it to a wash which, as Leth is attacking, is a victory.<br/><br/>Garrick takes his medium consequence and Brad narrates "Despised by the gods" for him. The gods are indeed watching, just as Leth offered in the concession, but there will be no honourable end to a duel between great noble beings. There will be a corpse. Lethe cannot counter and dies, in the middle of a blackened dead crater of volcanic ash and simple hate. Garrick is twisted and foul and no one can look upon him.<br/><br/>But victorious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283689/#Comment_283689" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T10:24:15+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 10:24AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>Garrick, (an awesome kickass Gorilla is) victorious.</blockquote>\nThat.

The Sei\xf0kona (me) got "you can have him dragged to the underworld at a price" and had to give up her Gift (which the ancestors transferred to the Princess).  That led to her feeling jealous and useless in the epilogue; she visibly aged a good 30 years when she gave up the Gift. Eventually she walked into the woods to die peacefully.  Meanwhile, the King went on this supposed suicide mission against the Eastern Kingdom, only to get "you succeed and then some!".  Earlier in the game, though, the cards were sometimes jarring; specifically when the result included "something unrelated goes bad/well."  That always stopped the flow of the game for a few minutes as people tried hard to come up with something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284014/#Comment_284014" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T13:09:59+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  1:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traveller:<br/><br/>For whatever reason, the rest of the crew were very worried by my scientist PCs request that they buy him a pet cat while planetside.

Te epic quest came to a Lords of the Rings end whereupon I threw everything but the kitchen sink at the party.<br/>- Vampires wearing black iron armor? Check<br/>- A room filled with giant spiders? Check<br/>- A former ally who became a vampire to gain enough strength to redeem her previous failure? Check<br/>- A half-demon son of a Player Character? Check<br/>- The avatar of an exiled god of darkness wearing a mythic bearskin making him impervious to mundane weapons that he summoned with an artifact wand? Check<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts was when I explained to the players that the skin the baddie was wearing made him immune to non-magical weapons and the player of the archer (who had no magical arrows at the time) replied, "I'm shooting that wand out of his hand!" which she did, right before he summoned something extremely nasty.<br/><br/>Second favorite part was when Scar, the dwarf PC, stood over the Starlight Forge with the wand knowing that he must fulfill a prophecy and destroy the thing that could bring back the dark god into the realm and I tell him.  "Here's the deal.  It isn't a question of whether you un-make the wand.  You fulfill the prophecy.  The question is, does Scar survive the ordeal?  Roll a Spirit check, if you fail, Scar is <i>also </i>un-made."
