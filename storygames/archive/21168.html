It occurred to me that the clever people of Story Games Land may have some good tips, practices, caveats, or experiences to share.<br/><br/>The short version is:<br/><br/>Some important things happened in the last session, and the PCs fled the scene. Now, the NPCs have some very important conversations to have with each other off-screen.<br/><br/>In our case, it's a very suspicious situation, a fight, and a car crash. The police are undoubtedly going to be trying to find out what's going on and talking to the NPCs involved.<br/><br/>The problem:<br/><br/>Going into the next session, trying to figure out what happened "behind the scenes" is a heavy mental load for the GM. Who said what? Lots of people have stakes involved in lying about what happened, but it's a complex situation and lots of NPCs have different stakes in play.<br/><br/>The question:<br/><br/>Going into the next session, I should really have some sense of what went down, who said what, and where things are heading.<br/><br/>Do you have any shorthand, tips, tricks, or other methods for dealing with a complex situation off-screen?<br/><br/>Think of any situation (maybe mine, maybe one from your own game) where a lot is at stake, and just skipping over all the details would be unsatisfying. <br/><br/>What's your process for resolving it and getting back to play? What are your favourite tricks?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463892/#Comment_463892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T21:14:35+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  9:14PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Some important things happened in the last session, and the PCs fled the scene.

Who cares what they say to each other.<br/><br/>I think what players really care about is what happens to their characters as a result.<br/><br/>So first option: Just jump into the consequences of the actions to the PCs.<br/><br/>But, accepting the premise that the players care what the NPCs are saying to each other, here are some ideas:<br/><br/>1. Hand players NPC sheets with brief motivations and have them play out the conversation. This sounds fun!<br/>2. Sum it up in a "love letter" to each PC. Of course, these come with choices.<br/>3. Write a script of the conversation and read it to the group. Yawn.<br/>4. Summarize what happened.

When there are many, though, it becomes mentally challenging to keep it straight in my head and make sure the whole thing is consistent.<br/><br/>An example:<br/><br/>One PC is going to be hanging out with a police officer. I know that this officer almost arrested her (the PC's) mother two days earlier, and that the mother probably lied about a variety of details. (It was heavily implied in the scene we played out "on screen" earlier.)<br/><br/>When the PC meets up with the police officer, I'd like to have his reaction and knowledge of events believably synch up with whatever the mother told him two days ago. It might mean he suspects the PC, or it might mean he suspects the PC's friend... for instance.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463898/#Comment_463898" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T21:46:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  9:46PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, maybe I emphasized the wrong bits.<br/><br/>How to decide?

(there's probably some evil laughter which should go here).<br/><br/>The challenge, though, is not in <i>deciding at all</i>. Like, this is Monsterhearts: of course we go to the drama.<br/><br/>The challenge, rather, is about doing it somewhat systematically or at least <i>economically</i>.<br/><br/>We had a couple of rather major events in play, and some important off-screen conversations, so there should be a good deal of fallout. However, there are many, many NPCs involved, and they should all influence each other believably - just like my example with the police officer above, except I've got maybe four-five of those situations suddenly happening at once and they're all interrelated.<br/><br/>Hence the "mental load": sure, I could sit down and think through every each one and try to find the most dramatic possibility, but that will take me a long time, and then I may have to rethink earlier conversations to make them consistent with new ideas I've had in later conversations. It's a lot!<br/><br/>I know it comes in games frequently, so I'm hoping to hear more about peoples' tips and tricks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463901/#Comment_463901" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T21:55:52+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  9:55PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that I have an answer.

But, it is quick and effective. Using your example above, if the policeman is NPC A, three of the six possibilities might be: NPC suspects the PCs involvement. NPC suspects the PCs friend's involvement. NPC knows the mother is holding back and is getting a warrant to bring her in for more official questioning. etc etc.<br/><br/>Edit: To be clear, this is kind of a half-measure between playing it out and handwaving it all. The idea being, you generate the investigation outcome. Then, go back and mine your NPCs for who would most likely contribute to said investigation outcome. If the policeman determines it was the PC who was involved, you might decide the mother is a good liar so someone else/something else tipped him off. Similarly, if the policeman is hot on the trail of the PCs friend, it could be because the mother did a great job of deflecting him onto that path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463906/#Comment_463906" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T23:00:47+00:00" title="June 12, 2017 11:00PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that the game's procedures can't handle it if one were to attempt to revise the GMing role so as to eliminate the dramatic coordination task altogether. I suppose a one-time thing couldn't hurt, of course, but then you're probably just best off rolling the dice a few times to decide between alternatives, and that's that.<br/><br/>In general, though, these types of games pretty much assume that the GM takes the artistic responsibility of recognizing what the dramatic issues are, and putting them in a pleasing order for the players to deal with. If there is a way to do this that doesn't involve what essentially amounts to handcrafting by the GM, then I don't know what it is.<br/><br/>As a general suggestion I'd recommend dealing with the NPCs as emblematic and simple personalities, and developing these personalities as literary themes throughout play. This means, essentially, that you repeat the message at the players any time you have the chance. "NPC A is a coward", for example, or whatever. So when deciding how NPCs act off-screen, you basically look at their themes and have them do their thematic thing. This approach keeps the NPC complexity manageable and helps the story cohere. As a bonus, if a NPC learns something and grows as a person it becomes a big deal.<br/><br/>(When does that NPC theme come to the attention of the players? Why, when the NPC explains themselves later, of course. "You're asking me how I knew to be here, now? Well, of course it was because I was such a coward, and therefore this happened, and then that..." It'll come out more or less explicitly, no worries.)<br/><br/>If the thematic premises of the various PCs genuinely don't suggest to you what scenes you might prefer over some others (and thus, what must have happened in between), then you probably should just let the most obvious things happen that illustrate what those NPCs are like. If they're dumb, then you take the dumbness storyline, and if they're brave, you take the bravery storyline. I can't remember ever having been in the situation myself, though, where I wouldn't prefer one off-screen series of actions over another in the interest of bringing the drama to the PCs. Usually some pretty Aristotelian plot direction suggests itself to me, and that's what I go with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463908/#Comment_463908" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T23:18:18+00:00" title="June 12, 2017 11:18PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd totally go for Adam's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> option.

You see, I tend to leave "off-screen" information out, focusing on the PCs. But here, enough has happened "off-screen" that without having some sense of what it is, I don't have enough information to play the NPCs in the next scene or two. (It may help to realize that the game in question is a relationship drama, not an investigation drama.)<br/><br/>Eero and WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>Determining "themes" or "emotions" for each NPC is exactly the type of shorthand I'm looking for, thank you! <br/><br/>I could leave it as simple as that, or I could determine an emotional approach and then occasionally use the *opposite* of that implication to decide what actually happened.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>* I choose or roll that the mother is in tears, desperately happy to see her daughter again, clinging to her and doesn't want to let her go ever again.<br/><br/>* In contrast, I use that to inspire me with the idea that, in fact, the mother has thrown the daughter to the police to cover up for her own misdeeds... which means that her tears and so forth or not from relief, but, rather, from a sense of guilt.<br/><br/>I'll ponder this further. Any other ideas?<br/><br/>Anecdotes and examples from actual games are also welcome! Have you run into this kind of thing in your own games? If so, how did you handle it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463932/#Comment_463932" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T19:51:50+00:00" title="June 13, 2017  7:51PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I haven\u2019t run Monsterhearts, only played it, but in normal AW, don\u2019t you have clocks &amp; fronts &amp; stuff for this?

I should perhaps clarify that my interest here is not one of *simulation* - it's a character drama, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with me just choosing things willy-nilly (in a way I wouldn't want to do in a sandbox game, for the reasons you describe very well in that thread).<br/><br/>I suppose the challenges here lie in the sheer complexity of the situation and a lack of prep time.<br/><br/>I'd like to be able to narrow down the possibilities, choose between them, while keeping them consistent with each other, so that I can easily play my NPCs in future scenes instead of freezing up while I try to figure out how someone reacts to something because I have no idea what happened "off-screen" to them on the previous day.<br/><br/>I'm good at doing that sort of thing in a) simpler situations, and b) when I have lots of time to devote to thinking it through. <br/><br/>I figure I can't be the only one to have been in this pickle, so I'm collecting people's tricks and experiences here! <br/><br/>(I suppose simply simulating the events, as you describe there, is definitely a valid tactic. However, it would be too time-consuming for this game, while not necessarily guaranteeing sufficiently dramatic or interesting outcomes. I could see using it for simpler situations where any given outcome is equally interesting, however! It's not a bad reminder to keep tools on hand, even if they seem not to match the medium being used - sometimes they can be just the right thing. For instance, I could see rolling randomly to see which classmate ends up with a missing/stolen item if none of the choices are obviously best or obviously terrible.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463944/#Comment_463944" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T00:03:01+00:00" title="June 14, 2017 12:03AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I also like your "love letters" suggestion.

Then figure out how each issue is resolved by some aspect of the <i>character</i>, not the NPC.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, have the player roll for their character's representation in their issue. Everyone will have deeper investment in how these NPCs react, as a result, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463949/#Comment_463949" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T06:06:41+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  6:06AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess what I'm saying is you can either sim it out, or, simply make it up.
