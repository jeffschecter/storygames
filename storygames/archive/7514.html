I apologize in advance for posting this "in medes res", but I want to start a record in a better forum.  This is the fourth game in our Magical Land of Yeld playtest.  I ran this time (David Drake).<br/><br/>Players:<br/>David - Black Mage, Female, age 8<br/>Dawn - Oathbreaker, Female, age 8<br/>Andrew - Witch, Female, age 6<br/><br/>Game state:<br/>Just killed the first Hunter.  Trapped in a tunnel at the end of the last session, under the collapsed Temple of the Dog.<br/><br/>This session was much smoother than the previous three; not as many rules questions this time around.  The basic session went as follows:<br/><br/>1. Trapped in the tunnels, the heroes navigated through the caves (some trouble working with a trap there), have bad dreams (another trap!), fight some cave bats, explore an evil shrine to Dragul, and pop out in a pirate cove.  This was the first part of the character building section, with the characters recalling bad memories from their lives in Boston.<br/><br/>2. Captured by pirates, they learn the pirates' predicament, agree to help in exchange for releasing their sister (they don't trust black mages), and perform some pirate tests to prove that they're the real deal.  Second part of the character building section, splitting them up for questioning by the pirate crew.<br/><br/>3. Paddling up in a rowboat to lonely island to fight the hydra.  Mostly a combat sequence, with a small preliminary fight and a larger boss fight inside.<br/><br/>Here are a few of my notes:<br/><br/>* Frequent magical disasters were kind to me this time: I now have a tail and blue hair.  Hooray!  I'm magical!<br/><br/>* Still hard to stat tough monsters that don't wipe the party, and I think I finally figured out why.  The witch and the black mage will always have fewer tough dice than our oathbreaker (duh!), but there's nothing preventing a big monster from wacking them first.  I'm hoping the revised rules (which apparently have counters and a battle map) will make this less of an issue.  Similarly, it's still hard to make a monster that can't be killed fast.  I cheated by making a hydra that regenerated one head every round, but it still only lasted three rounds.  It's not that I want epic long fights; it's just hard to make a monster that the oathbreaker has to struggle to hit.  Clearly I need to give them more than three tough dice (and two ranks in fly!)<br/><br/>* Pacing was much better this time.  I used the whole Star Wars three environments rule, starting with a cave adventure, moving to confrontation with pirates, and finally an assault on lonely island.  It didn't have quite the same "go kill this" feel, since they had a bit more of a reason to do it this time, but was still a little too formulaic.  I'll have to figure out a good way to change it up on my next run.  When Andrew does his Keymas episode, I bet that will give us a chance to do a less boss-oriented session.  I'm really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>* Sometimes, the characters want to fight the NPCs.  I didn't know what to do about that.  I was in a sort of "cutscene" section where the characters are taken prisoner by a band of pirates, and they declared they wanted to fight.  I sidelined it by taking my own character hostage (So cheap!), but that didn't really address the issue.<br/><br/>Definitely looking forward to the next session and the revised rules.  Too bad Andrew doesn't work in a print shop any more...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197949/#Comment_197949" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T01:44:49+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  1:44AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry I didn't see this when you first posted it in September. Sounds like you had a lot of fun. Are you still playing? Hopefully the recent edition of the text will  solve your problems. You can find it <a href="http://jake-richmond.livejournal.com/84338.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>I have some suggestions.<br/><br/>-Boss Monsters can be tricky, especially if you have a  small party. You can make a Boss Monster a lot tougher by giving it armor or Special dice like Fatty Fat Fatty without actually giving it more Tough dice. This will make it tougher for the Oathbreaker to kill, while still giving the Witch and Black Mage a chance at it.<br/><br/>If your Oathbreaker turns out to be an unstoppable boss monster killer you may want to cripple her before the fight starts. Before they confront the boss monster the kids could get ambushed by some other monsters using Fight Dirty, Trip and other special dice that take away Strong and Brave dice. The friends will surely beat these monsters, but they'll come out of the fight beat up and at  a disadvantage,and hat's a perfect time to spring the boss monster on them. The boss monster can make use of the same tactics or even be paired up with otehr monsters that can protect him from the Oathbreaker. A cheap monster spellcaster with Friendship, Blind, Scary Face or Creepy Touch can shut down an Oathbreaker pretty easily!<br/><br/>Another way to approach this is that it's the Oathbreakers job to hit monsters, so let her do that. Give the monster enough tough dice to survive for as many rounds as it needs to and pick off the Witch and Black Mage instead. Force the Oathbreaker to choose between killing the boss and protecting her friends.<br/><br/>-I think the town rules in the new text will clear up the npc fighting problems that everyone seems to be having. <br/>On the otehr hand, not every fight needs to be lethal. there's nothing wrong with letting the kids defeat the pirates, townsfolk or whatever,and then reveal that it s all a misunderstanding.<br/><br/>I hope your enjoying the game. Pleas epost again if you continue to play!<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197994/#Comment_197994" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T06:55:57+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  6:55AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to see more Yeld actual plays.

I'm awful at writing actual play, and we're not currently playing right now anyway, but when we do start again I'm going to make a serious effort to log our games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom" title="Ru_Baraba_Dom"><img alt="Ru_Baraba_Dom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/559/n1DT8PKZTUJ28.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom">Ru_Baraba_Dom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201981/#Comment_201981" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T11:57:23+00:00" title="April 14, 2009 11:57AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been unable to play for a while (wife/oathbreaker is teaching), but I'd definitely like to get another round going.
