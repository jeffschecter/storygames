I really like the Wizard one.  I like the rogue one, but I think you could make it even better if it was a prisoner's dilemma game, where each character had to secretly decide if they trust the other, rather than leaving it up to the rogue.<br/><br/>The bard one is really good to.  It says something about bards and the place of art in the world that maybe isn't true in every D&amp;D game I've played, but becomes true in this one by virtue of the move.  Similarly with the fighter and violence.  Similarly the cleric and faith.<br/><br/>I don't really like the paladin move, though.  I feel like it's trying to hit the middle ground of two very different views of how the paladin feels about sex and sexuality, and in doing so doesn't mean much of anything.<br/><br/><br/>The ones that give your partner limited use of your abilities (druid and sorcerer) seem very flat to me, to much about what that character does instead of who that character is.  Originally, I was putting the Ranger in this category too.  After re-reading the move, I get it--It's about where the character is comfortable.  You might want to re-write the move to make the thematic elements more obvious.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, you might want to re-write them all to match the formatting used in AW:  "When you do X, Y happens".  That will let you more easily clarify certain aspects of the moves, and might even be a vehicle for finding something cool to do with other moves, perhaps "when you lie with another under the light of the full moon"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441217/#Comment_441217" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-06T22:45:13+00:00" title="January  6, 2015 10:45PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Further thoughts on a possible paladin move.

I will consider what you have said and likely incorporate some of it. I don't love the "lose inspiration if you have it" part of the proposed new Paladin move\u2014too sexist, and too punishing. I think it's strong enough without that, and certainly better than what I wrote initially.<br/><br/>Certainly I agree that the language could be cleaned up. I'll make sure to do that before the game rolls out.<br/><br/>One thing being bandied about on my accompanying G+ thread is to let people choose whether their sex move comes from their class or their background. Although on second thought, this may be tough to implement.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>: you haven't met my girlfriend. That's all I'm saying.
