I'm new to the board, thanks to hearing about LD via the Podgecast. Please forgive me if this question has been asked before, but I've been through the posts tagged with LB and couldn't find it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy players were wondering how often they should be hitting a Key per session. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with keys like Key of the Mission, what qualifies as hitting it? In theory, most actions could be considered moving towards the goal of the mission (unless obviously counter-productive), but my player felt it was a bit unfair if every action netted him xp while the others were not advancing at the same rate. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have LB, Darkening Skies and the LB companion that I've found on these boards. Are there any other Tales from the Wild Blue Yonder? How does one get involved in creating these?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334929/#Comment_334929" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T14:14:13+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  2:14PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out this<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/03/lady-blackbird-hacks.html" rel="nofollow"> page of hacks</a> for even more LB-style fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335001/#Comment_335001" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T05:03:49+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  5:03AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird is heavily based on <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, I understand. The Key of the Mission in the latter is pinged at substantial goal-posts related to the mission, not at any activities related to it. Basically, merely doing something is not enough, but the results of the action have to progress the mission in some quantifiable and permanent way. A typical mission will involve anywhere from one to a half dozen such goal-posts on the way to achieving the overarching goal. For example, if looking for a pirate treasure, you would not get experience points for fighting with other pirates or escaping from the governor's men or any of that routine shit - you would only ping your Key when you find the treasure map, get it interpreted or do something similar that concretely brings you closer to the treasure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335138/#Comment_335138" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T15:40:20+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  3:40PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Christine!<br/><br/>What Eero says is how I usually do it. You hit a Key when you do something significant that fits the requirements for the Key. I'd say 1-2 XP per scene is pretty normal. But it's intentionally left open for the group to decide. Faster or slower is totally fine.<br/><br/>One thing you can do, if you want to change the speed of advancement, is make an advance cost more XP (instead of slowing down XP collection). 10 xp per advance maybe.<br/><br/>Check out the other hacks UserClone linked to above. If you're inspired, make your own and let me know about it. I'll link it over on the blog (and all the LB hacks will also be linked on the LB website soon).<br/><br/>Thanks for giving the game a try!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335176/#Comment_335176" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T22:52:12+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 10:52PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In unrelated news, I really want a Mouse Guard hack for LB.
