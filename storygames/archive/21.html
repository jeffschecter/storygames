                    This could also go in Actual Play, but I'm interested in it from a design perspective.<br/><br/>At NC GameDay, I had a table with myself, five other enthusiastic, aggressive indie gamers, and some dude who was completely unclear on the concept.  He was interested - he'd signed up well in advance - and he wasn't disruptive, but his participation took a game that could have been king-hell awesome and made it just awesome.  He slowed things down, he turtled, he didn't really participate much at all, and afterward, under close questioning, he said he had a great time.    He certainly laughed and tried hard to understand the system, so I can't fault him personally.  But as a <em>type</em> he brought my game down for everybody.<br/><br/>I bring this up because it was intensely interesting to me as a designer to observe him, and see the effect his participation had on the games we played (The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, PTA, and Face of Angels).  I <em>want</em> to be welcoming and accessible to people like him, and I want to help them appreciate this kind of gaming - what are the best ways to make this happen?  How do I balance the satisfaction of hard-charging Forge goofs with Rifts players who stumble up to the table?   In a convention setting, is that even my job?  How do we design games that are easier to grok for "newbies"?  How do we format convention play to facilitate this?  How best to handle them at the table?  Share you experiences and suggestions!                </div>

                            I think the center of this is the simplicity of your core game theme. If a player, even a neophyte, cannot grasp your game concept in one paragraph then maybe you need to rethink your core play.                        </div>

                            OK, that's definitely true.  And all three games we played pass that test.  I'd argue that it needs to be a single sentence.  But in any case, our neophyte understood the theme (or said he did) and still didn't have the tools to frame scenes, set stakes, collaborate with other players, or narrate effectively or entertainingly, even after lots of good examples.  <br/><br/>Was he an isolated, worst-case sort of guy?  Do we need a series of games that take baby steps to introduce these concepts in play?  Do we need to play existing games differently?  Do we need to just say "this game is not for you, go do something else"?  In convention play that last choice is moronic and generally impossible anyway.  I hope these questions don't make me sound like an ass.                        </div>

                            From experience, when people say "yeah, I get this. I'm on board." they are often not getting it and not on board, but only saying so to please you or move onto the next thing. It only comes out when you ask them to do whatever it is again, without being led.<br/>

So it's a case of building slowly and positively re-enforcing. Something a con game won't always be able to do.<br/>

                            My experience supports that - I've introduced the Roach to people who had never played a roleplaying game before and they did just fine.  <br/><br/>So how do you handle someone like this at the table, Matt?

                            I agree with Matt.  <br/>
<br/>
 So it's a case of building slowly and positively re-enforcing. Something a con game won't always be able to do. <br/>
<br/>
That could very well be the case in this situation.  And it could be that he was the 'worse case scenario' player.  But being at that table, I noticed that the three people that said they had the most issue and even stated that they 'felt sorry for him' gave up on him by Act III.  Remember we are all there to all have fun.  Yes he brought the table down a bit, but very few of us tried to pick him up to bring the table up. When we left the table, I had to tell two players 'that felt sorry' for the n00b to not make assumptions... go frigging ask him how he felt about the game.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember, for him... that was a HUGE leap of faith.  His world is D20 = awesome and everything else = teh suck.  He signed up.  He showed up.  And he did that before even knowing anything about the game.  And he kept trying out other games.  It very well might not have been his day.  It could have been just like Matt said.  <br/>
<br/>
Notice, he was not the only player that turtled.  The other player turtled on many occassions.  The only difference was that when he didn't he was very loud about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Jason said:<br/>
<br/>
 Do we need to play existing games differently? Do we need to just say "this game is not for you, go do something else"? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we do need to play existing games differently but to start telling people that 'this game isn't for you' is the worst thing we could do.  Worse than letting clueless n00bs into the game.  <br/>
<br/>
Okies... so now that I have totally made myself the bitch queen, anyone see what I am talking about?<br/>

                            I think part of it (I was in the Face of Angels game with Jason, and the guy he's referring to is "Bob") was that... well, it was like going to a Yoga class.  Bob wanted to give Yoga a shot, and walked into all the Advanced Yoga Madness classes.  <br/>
<br/>
On one hand, we were very nice and helpful, helping him hold positions, and giving him basic cues why we do what we do.<br/>
<br/>
But at the end of the day, because we spent a lot of time helping him break into the World of Yoga, it was harder for us to do what we came to do, which was some crazy mad power advanced yoga.<br/>
<br/>
I think I may have a kind of solution:<br/>
<br/>
When you're at home, or in a Meetup group, your gaming will be directed towards the Mad RPG Yoga that you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
When you're at a Con, expect that you're going to have to take it slow, and bring people into the game and up to speed. Go over the rules, direction, and style of play SLOWLY. Literally, half the experience is for Your Enjoyment, and half the experience is to get people interested in these Story Games. Now, if it turns out that everyone in the Con game is ALSO a Crazy Mad Yoga Master, then feel free to go nuts together, kicking it into high gear.<br/>
<br/>
But otherwise, Con games are as much an uplift (not to indicate that X is BETTER than Y, but I use the term uplift here to mean "to get them used to, to warm them up to") experience for people new to these games as a fun experience for all. I think that might be the right attitude to view them. Recruit and Assist, and get your own mad fun on in personal games and Meetup games.                        </div>

<i>...still didn't have the tools to frame scenes, set stakes, collaborate with other players, or narrate effectively or entertainingly, even after lots of good examples.</i><br/><br/>This really feels like the rub to me.  Other than examples, what went into giving him these tools?<br/><br/>Not that good examples aren't valuable, but to be frank, if you were already on the same page with the other players, their examples may have looked very good to you without necessarily being useful to someone without context.<br/><br/>As to th eimportant stuff:<br/><i>I want to be welcoming and accessible to people like him, and I want to help them appreciate this kind of gaming - what are the best ways to make this happen? How do I balance the satisfaction of hard-charging Forge goofs with Rifts players who stumble up to the table? In a convention setting, is that even my job? How do we design games that are easier to grok for "newbies"? How do we format convention play to facilitate this? How best to handle them at the table? Share you experiences and suggestions!</i><br/><br/>I'm just going to posit that you may not be able to do both at once.  Hardcore Indie-heads have a lot of accumulated lore, practice and support, and they have a lot of enthusiasm for chances to play with similar folks, but that body of lore can be as daunting as a new player walking into Advanced Squad Leader.  Sometimes you can hit just the right note - you can have a whole group that really wants to support and help (but not overhelp) the new person - but unless you've got that whole-group investment, the GM has to juggle priorities.<br/><br/>That makes for games like you describe.  If the goal of the game had been to teach new players, it probably would have been much better for th enew guy and less good for the old hands.  If you had decided to play purely to the old hands, the game probably would have been more awesome, but at the cost of alienating the new guy.  So you split the difference and pull the guy in some, but make a less good game, and all in all, that's not a bad outcome.<br/><br/>What's most telling here is that there are two potential issues: A concern thatthe game wasn't as good as it coudl be for the experience players, and a concern that the game didn't sufficiently draw in the new guy.  Reading the post, I feel like the former is the one more heavily on your mind, which may be an answer in and of itself.<br/><br/>That may be me misreading your intent, but I'd be curious if you think so.  There's a lot of weight to that implicit message - enough to make it very  important, but also enough to not make me wan tto extrapoalte further without firm footing.<br/><br/>Anyway, short form, as in game design, the trick seems to be in having a clear vision of what your goal is, and running with it.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I think a 'cheat sheet' may have been very helpful, Jason. I think Bob responded well to the one I created. For me, technically a newbie unto myself, all it took for me to grok these ideas was one enthusiastic game of PTA (but I have been a Forge lurker for a while and had some ideas already). I really do think the guy was looking for some rules that he could read and point to so that he didn't feel he was doing it 'wrong'. Maybe an elite gaming skills cheat sheet might be helpful, with cool comics or something that ameloriates the feel of 'you're playing wrong, play this way' vibe that such a document might give off.                        </div>

                            Oh, first, totally ironic use of Clueless N00b.  As a Counter-Strike:Source player,  I'm incapable of using it any other way.  Even though I totally have l33t skillz0rz. <br/><br/>From my perspective, when I sat down I knew that everybody was on the bus except for Bob, and that he would be a challenge and an opportunity.  If you get any sense that I was angry or frustrated, please assume it's the medium and not my intention.  <br/><br/>Lisa, do you feel I gave up on him?  I didn't see your comments as bitchy at all, BTW.<br/><br/>I think it is telling that he chose to hang out with us between games, even though he came with a posse of friends playing other games.  I think he did have a good time (he told me he did!), and maybe I'm worried about this needlessly.  Maybe my expectations were set too high for a con game of any stripe.  <br/><br/>Mark, what are you thinking would help - a run-down of the Event sequence maybe?  Tell me what you think would be ideal in terms of play aids, because there was a bunch of stuff there.                        </div>

<br/>
Yes, I do think you gave up on him. By the time we got back from lunch and you got into the next game with him, you already had your mind set as to how he was going to be at the table.  At least, that is the way it seemed to me.  (But remember, medication makes me loopy!)  And no, I didn't feel you were angry, but that "What is wrong with him?  Why won't he 'get it'?" feeling was plainly obvious to me.  I doubt he noticed it though as he seemed the same outside of the game as he did at the table.  <br/>
<br/>
As for needless worry?  No.  That you did not do.  You brought up a good point that needs to be addressed.  As for your expectations being too high for a con game?  Most certainly.  Bu then I didn't realize that one could set their expectations 'too high' which is something good for me to know since I'm running games at Origins and GenCon.  I'd rather we learn this lesson now, at a small, friendly con than at one of the huge ones where we're trying to help pimp the games we are running.                        </div>

                            I think I would have a document, a one-sheet even, with large titles, with such headings as:<br/>
Why am I describing this scene (as opposed to that gal over there)?<br/>
How can I have fun while helping everyone else have fun?<br/>
Why isn't there a GM?<br/>
What's off limits? (different from lines and veils)<br/>
How did I become the GM, when there isn't even one in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
I think that might hit some salient points, be explanative, and maybe help those wanting 'rules'. Does that work at all?                        </div>

<br/>
A lot of 'cons will have games list "expertise level" for games, such as the difference between jumping into a beginner's D&amp;D game vs. a hardcore advanced 10th Dan Black Belt of Grognard mastery game.   Maybe including something like that for your con games if you're wanting to go all out might be necessary?                        </div>

                            Actually, the Con did have such a mechanism, and Jason used it ("Mature/Experienced"), but being Experienced in RIFTS and coming to play Polaris is just as much of a leap as being Experienced with Risus or Sorcerer and playing Warhammer 40k.<br/>
<br/>
Most RPG players simply aren't going to look at them (unless they are the parents of roleplayers and want to make sure they're getting into family-oriented games), or if they do the terms are going to mean something different than we need them to mean.  Or do we?  Maybe Cons are, after all, places where we take folk under our wings and get them used to ownership over elements of the game.<br/>

I've seen it happen with many of the groups I've played with where one or two people "get it" and start flying and one or two people don't, and turtle up looking around in bewilderment unable to figure out how to engage the "controls" as it were.<br/>
<br/>
Typically though, for hardcore anything play, I'd probably want to know who I'd be playing with, and just assume tutorial-play for cons as the standard.                        </div>

                            Hey Alex,  I bet you'd do great.  Mark Causey's pretty new to this style of play and he did great.  I don't agree that there needs to be an "indie games for n00bs" track, but a good mix of seasoned player and new guy is probably best.  The more I think about it (and thanks for all the discussion here!) the more I think I need to adjust my "public play" expectations, which in retrospect is pretty obvious.  <br/><br/>I totally could have said, "OK, I need two of you guys to play the Roach with me and these two new guys - the rest of you, here's PTA" or something, and focused on providing a useful and fun experience for the people who had never played the Roach before.  That would have been more civilized and professional, and speaks to my failure to assess my table and take control.  I'm learning!                        </div>

I try to be (more) respectful and nice outside my blog, since, you know, this isn't "my" space, but -our- space.  Was there something contentious you were afraid was going to activate "Chris Smash!" ?  :P                        </div>

OK, I said that for shock value. What I mean is, if I'm playing for pleasure alone, I play with people I know are good at it and no outsiders. If I'm playing to demonstrate the game, I play to demonstrate the game. Which can be fun, too, but I set my expectations to a lower level, and am pleasantly surprised if play goes super-well.<br/>

Don't mix business (or teaching) with pleasure. <br/>

                            With such a small scope as our Gameday, relatively, and with the labeling of the level of the games, and that there were plenty of other D&amp;D games he could have signed up for, we probably were in the right mental percentages about who was going to show up.<br/><br/>Dangit, I just remembered something I overheard him say to his posse:<br/><br/><code>When I went to register, all the games I wanted were filled up.

                            ... You know, what if the games you ran listed prerequisites, like college classes do?<br/>

So, if you want to play Shock: you should have at least played and enjoyed two games of Dogs, PTA, With Great Power..., or Trollbabe.<br/>
<br/>
That way, when people show up, it can be clear that they'll be doing something new, both to the people running the game and the new folks. <br/>

It would be absurd to require that these games be true prerequisites, but it sure would rationalize the expectations of the players.                        </div>

                            Hnh.  While that's a really practical approach in terms of the quality of an individual game, I'd worry about it appearing elitist.  Something broad like "Experienced players preferred" is one thing, but laying down criteria, especially criteria that is so strongly drawn from the indie pool, could really just end up reinforcing stereotypes.<br/>

A little damage of some sort was rolling around in the back of that head-box.<br/><br/>What I'm really interested in hearing is more about the con games for newbies at MACE: Because I think Eric's DITV table was filled with like 6 people who never played any of this crap before (and Adam Dray, who had).  We had the "Guy who talked on and on about his Deadlands character", and "the chick who spent 5 minutes telling you that her Dog's eyes were hazel".  At the end, IIRC (Adam? Eric?) 5 people were excited, and one person still didn't quite get it, but it wasn't enough to slow down the train.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that Bob was an exception.  Like, sure, if we run a Con game, and a Bob wanders in, I'm thinking we'll spend more time initially "warming him up", "getting him up to speed", and used to the way of playing these games. But in most cases, I think the default for New to Indies folks is "I'm interested, and will totally adapt, but it will take me a second" and "I'm interested, will give it a shot, and realize that it's just not my thing after all" from what I've seen at con events. <br/><br/>I remember recruiting and getting hardcore some 5-7 total D&amp;D heads at Trinoc-Con over two years into being big fans of Rafael Chandler's Dread, just by dragging them into the game. One guy from my game has run Dread games for two years consecutively since then. I got five people into a Dust Devils game (2 worked for White Wolf, one pretty much stuck to mainstream, and the other two were pretty open to anything though they hadn't played this kind of game before) and totally converted (as is "they bought the game next month") three. Or the "Fudge FATE: "The Chronicles of Vin Diesel" " Con game where every player played Vin Diesel: One dude there was totally tuned into small press games though didn't have many oppportunities to play, and the other two just wandered in because it sounded fun, and walked away having a fuckload of fun...<br/><br/>...when it comes down to it, the last time I can truly recall sitting in a game session with a 'Bob' was like some 7+ years ago at GenCon: In a game of AD&amp;D 2E.  Still, I think we cracked Bob's shell by the end of the games a little, and got him out and taking more control over his character, but severe cases like him are rare, when I started thinking about all my other con gaming experiences.<br/><br/>We still have to prepare for what to do when a Bob comes to town, but I think we can do so in a sense of "It is rare that this will happen, but..." sense, not "Expect this at every con game" sense.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy, you have a crazy good memory. You didn't even play in that Dogs game. You were off Roaching with Clinton and crew on the other side of the room.  <br/><br/>The "my character's eyes are hazel" woman seemed to think that she was supposed to fill her spotlight time with detailed description. What she was missing was that her exposition was supposed to matter to the entire group, not just to her. It's a social skill people learn or don't learn -- knowing when your audience is bored or not. You know the type who doesn't have the skill. They start telling you a story about something they did. They get bogged down in meaningless details. Maybe they have little "arguments" with themselves about some stupid detail. "So last March... er, maybe it was April... it must have been April because Mom was in town... but it might have been the end of April or the beginning of May..." Whatever! It was Spring. Move on. Hazel-eyes-chick couldn't tell that we didn't care, and everyone else at the table could. She needed to focus her exposition on details relevant to her character's motivations and keep the color to the bare minimum necessary to hold the audience's interest.<br/><br/>Remember, your character needs the "underwriting" (thanks, Vincent) of the entire play group. Everyone has to buy into the character. Otherwise, it's not gaming sex, it's gaming masturbation. Fun for you, but dull to watch after a while.                        </div>

<code>Andy, you have a crazy good memory. You didn't even play in that Dogs game. You were off Roaching with Clinton and crew on the other side of the room.</code><br/><br/>Your description of the event was just that memorable.  "Hazel fucking eyes" has become a meme for me as strong as "Tell me about your character" and the like.<br/><br/>Just for shits, here's an excerpt from the last paragraph of the character generation section of The Ghost Killers:<br/><br/><i>"Well, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pretty much done. Describe your character to others.  <b>Be brief; No one cares if you have hazel fucking eyes. Get on with it so the others can get a basic idea, then get into the story.</b>  But make sure you tell the others your Trigger Event: ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important. It frames how they should think of your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions, which can influence how they award you drama chips."</i> </div>

                            All points well taken.  I've got a bit of observation on Mrs Hazel Eyes.<br/><br/>I don't think she thought she was <i>supposed</i> to write 'Hazel Eyes' on her sheet as a trait.  But they were obviously very important to her.  If they weren't I'm pretty confident she wouldn't have brought them up as often as she did.  Had I been able to convey to that group just what exactly was supposed to go on that character sheet then I'd bet big money that she'd have had Hazel Eyes-2d10.<br/><br/>-Eric                        </div>

                            It sounds to me like Eric's right: Ms. Hazel's behavior is a classic reaction to "The stuff I care about with my character doesn't matter to the game". It sounds like she needs Dogs bad.<br/><br/>You know, I totally take back my "prerequisite" idea. There's no reason to turn people away before they play. We need some way, when running indie games, to get people up to speed. Knowing that Hazel might be in the audience, we might want to say, "The stuff you're writing down on your Dog sheet is what's important to <i>you</i>, not the Dog. It's your way of saying what's important and how it works," which is a lead-in to "No, d4s don't get rolled against you," and other such weirdnesses.                        </div>
