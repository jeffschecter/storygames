The games were still fun but they were far more taxing on me as the GM. Now that I run games that require little to no prep I find I have far less tension and so do the players. Specifically games that require collaborative world and/or character creation work well at alleviating tension. If everyone at the table is already excited and invested there is no reason to get jittery.<br/><br/>To create tension before play begins I like to send emails out mid-week or a day or two before the game with info about what happened last game, rumors or stuff going on in the world. Before play begins getting a mood going or preparing the gaming space can create a lot of tension - lightning and music, candles or even less stable chairs like bean bag chairs. For horror/suspense games I've had the most success with a darkened space, beanbag chairs for the players and me standing as the GM, walking around. We did a Call of Cthulhu game that way, with each player getting one candle and whenever their character got taken out of the fight I blew out their candle. It was great fun - though the blowing out the candle bit I got from somewhere else. Anyway, lots of fun.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386938/#Comment_386938" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-12T21:25:07+00:00" title="August 12, 2012  9:25PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            kksimons is correct. <br/><br/>I used to hate running games because nerves would derail me and I'd massively over-prep which made something fun into a chore. Id worry all session that my game was not being enjoyed because traditional games put alot of pressure on the GM as the storyteller. <br/><br/>Apocalypse world with its fronts, play to see what happens and player driven gaming aspects cured me of that.<br/><br/>Another way to help get rid of jitters is to play a simple system that you know well. If you can't play without having to look at the rulebook (except maybe for a table) then you are either playing a game you don't know well enough or one that is unnecessarily complex.  (YMMV IMHO)<br/><br/>I find the biggest obstacle to maintaining tension is focus. Keep the players focused and a good story tells itself. Tension can be created via changes in tone and volume of voice and also by quickly changing from player to player mid-scene. For horror If you want players to be fearful, build up your NPCs, give them names and families and personalities...and then kill them brutally.:D<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386941/#Comment_386941" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-12T21:39:22+00:00" title="August 12, 2012  9:39PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any good advice you can find for eliminating pre-show jitters for stage actors generally also work for GMs.<br/><br/>The main one I keep in mind is: they haven't read the script. If you drop a line or do something out of order, it doesn't matter as long as you forge ahead and keep the fun in mind. You can't get the plot 'wrong' or 'mess up the story', because it's completely new to them, and they're sitting there WANTING to enjoy the whole thing, so just keep going if you drop something or skip something you meant to cover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386952/#Comment_386952" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T00:44:25+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 12:44AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do whatever you would normally do to keep yourself calm. If you had an interview, for instance. For me it's:<br/><br/>- Being reasonably well prepped. The amount of prep I require has gone down over the years as I get more experienced, but there's no doubt that having everything worked out and more importantly having my notes well-organised has helped me to feel more confident in the past. Reality: I don't really need those notes, but it's nice to have them there and from time to time they come in handy. Having the confidence that I know what "my" plot is helps me to have a good handle on what to do when the players do something totally unexpected, too.<br/><br/>- Don't over-prep. You'll be surprised how little is accomplished in the typical RPG session, at least if my experience is anything to go by. I almost always find I've prepped more material than I needed to.<br/><br/>- Get a good night's sleep; make sure I have my morning cup of tea and something for breakfast. Make sure I have a proper lunch, and avoid snacking. From experience, heaving snacking just makes me feel crappy, which is the last thing I want when I'm GMing.<br/><br/>- Try to avoid last-minuteness. I've lost count of the number of times I'm prepping late the night before or early the morning before, and it just creates unnecessary stress. Make sure you've allowed plenty of time for any prep you need to do so you can relax the evening before.<br/><br/>- Get someone else to take care of extraneous tasks. I'm incredibly grateful to my other half who frequently makes food when we're gaming. (To be clear: she's in the game with us.) And recently, I've been very grateful to one of the players who picks people up in her car, saving me a trip. All this means the hours before the session are mine to do what I want with, whether it's last-minute prep or (preferably) just relaxing.<br/><br/>Those are my top tips, but you have to be yourself. Lots of people like to take a walk or meditate or whatever before interviewing, and it seems to me a sound technique for GMing if you get nerves. Whatever works for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386972/#Comment_386972" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T08:08:36+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  8:08AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whiskey.....<br/><br/>I run 3 games a week, sometimes more if there is something special going on. The types of games I run are low prep, to no prep, and rely heavily upon player involvement. Most of the people I run games for anymore have never played any sort of Story Game before. So I usually end up a nervous wreck before the game. And then it starts, and everything usually works out. But man is it nerve wracking to know that you are about to jump into something so mentally intensive, but have no idea what it will be. I often do not even know what system it will be. <br/><br/>I generally create tension by asking the players what they think their character cares about, then I create a plot element that I feel will hit upon that. Then I go back and forth between players asking them questions about (how they feel about X) and do what I can to get them worked up. Eventually someone will instigate something. Sometimes this ends badly with blank stares......that is usually about same time that someone gets shot, usually it is a character instead of a player.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387002/#Comment_387002" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T13:29:24+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  1:29PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I been experimenting with warm-ups 5 minutes before the game, to relive the pressure of "being awesome" as soon as the game starts.

Our favorite warm-up game so far is "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Advice", but we have been doing it in a circle, so that we alternate between asking for advice and giving the different kind of advice.<br/><br/>"Description<br/><br/>3 players, form a line (or sit down). The audience provides questions or problems for which they need advice. The 3 players provide good, bad, and really bad advice. Have the MC choose who provide what advice, so everyone can have a stab at really bad advice. If the `bad advice` is really bad, then the Ugly advice should be even worse. You can play this as a Die game - if a bad advice is not followed by an even worse advice, replace the last player by another one."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
