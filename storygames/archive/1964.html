                    (Note: I'm not trying to be flippant here, but have a semi-serious discussion.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm one of those guys who likes the Forge, and those guys come up with funky games like "Capes" and "Universalis" and "Polaris," and lots of other stuff.  And there's this understanding on the Forge that these are all role-playing games.  (In contrast, there's a loud section--I don't know if it's a majority--of RPG.Net that wouldn't consider these RPG's at all.)<br/>
<br/>
So here's my question for people who define RPG's pretty broadly: what's an RPG?  More importantly, what's NOT an RPG?<br/>
<br/>
Like, one of the definitions of an RPG I've seen is, "An RPG is a process whereby people hang out, and imagine some stuff happening, together."<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone's familiar with Vincent Baker's LEGO wargame, Mechaton, Vincent calls it a "wargame."  Yet Vincent, Emily, and Joshua are workin' up a war in an imaginary city, with imaginary politics, and silly little government ministers, and things.  How is this not an RPG, albeit one where authority is distributed through unspoken social norms rather than a game text?<br/>
<br/>
If it is not an RPG, what is the imaginative or formal difference between this mode of playing Mechaton, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons?<br/>
<br/>
At the other end of the spectrum: why is Primetime Adventures a role-playing game, but collaborating with four other people to write a TV series not?<br/>
<br/>
Hypothesis: a "role-playing game" is a process for creative collaboration, and its "mechanics" settle creative differences between the participants.  Traditionally the outcome of the creative collaboration is a story of some kind (Event A, then Event B, then Event C), and the mechanics are geared to reflect this assumption.  But why couldn't one create such a process for, say, writing a piece of music, or collaborative architecture?  (I.e., why are we hung up on stories?)<br/>
<br/>
DISCLAIMER: I have final exams now.  I shouldn't be posting, really!  I'm stupid and deserve to be punished.  I await the righteous fury of the registrar.                </div>

                            I think a key part of <i>roleplaying game</i> as it's usually used is that the players (either via the characters or not) make substantive judgements of value with regard to the fiction.<br><br>Let's unpack that a tiny bit: What I mean is that in a role-playing game, you are free to decide that, for instance, rescuing the princess is a bad idea, and that such a decision concretely affects you gameplay.  In Monopoly, you are free to decide that overcharging for property is a bad idea, but you are not mechanically allowed to stop, so that's a null decision.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Here is an edited excerpt from the first draft of my (unpublished) article on The Big Model Without Jargon:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>In roleplaying games [ ... ] the â€œboardâ€ and â€œtokensâ€ are negotiable, unlike in chess or Monopoly. I write â€œboardâ€ and â€œtokensâ€ in quotes, because although some gamers may use a physical map and some kind of counters or miniatures, these are not the real board and the real tokens. The real action occurs in a fictional world that the players are creating together; they describe what various fictional people and creatures are doing, the locales they are passing through, and the events that occur in those locales.</p>
<p>Roleplaying games have rules that govern who can introduce which kinds of elements to the fictional world, as well as when and how they may be introduced. And here's the important part: <em>the rules also govern how they may be used</em>. The board and tokens in roleplaying games are fictional and completely negotiable, but this is true of other games where the object is to create some kind of story, even in a game as simple as â€œexquisite corpseâ€. The difference between roleplaying games and other story-creation games is that the contents of the fiction can affect what can be added or what can change. The players aren't just playing with words, they're creating a world together that is described in words.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thus, although Vincent, Emily, and Joshua are creating additional fictional elements like government ministers, these fictional elements have no effect in turn on the fiction. They're just window dressing for a traditional wargame. Compare that to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, where a player could imaginatively describe a way to permanently alter the board (dungeon) or tokens on the board (monsters, objects) in an unforseen way, and that alteration has an effect on what other actions may then be attempted. I may say to the DM "Wait! You said these goblins were mining, right? That means they have mining tools. And since we can't seem to get this magic door open or bust it down or anything, let's just dig a tunnel through the wall!" The description of the goblins as miners, originally just color, indirectly creates fictional picks and shovels, which the player characters can then use for digging a tunnel, which alters the geography of the dungeon.</p>
<p>To me, that's the most important feature of a roleplaying game: recursive alteration of the fiction created by the game. I've seen some games labeled as RPGs that have very little of this recursiveness. I've made the mistake myself of designing games where the fiction created has very little effect. The less recursion there is, the more the game resembles a traditional board or card game. The more recursion, the more roleplaying.</p>

                            Ben, that's interesting.  Do you remember those "Choose Your Own Adventure Books" that were popular among elementary-school kids in the 80's?  (They were, when I was a kid.)  As I recall, they had stuff like that--"If you want to rescue the princess anyway, read page 271."  I can see elements of your definition there, since the audience can make decisions.  But it's hard to wrap my head around the notion of a pre-planned, one-way mode of communication where the real-world participants are so radically separated in time.  It seems like you've got a spectrum: fairly conventional RPG's, PBEM games, and then that...  I wonder where the RPG-ness drops out.                        </div>

In a game, there are rules.  Those rules govern the behaviour of the people playing. Those rules are meant to make the activity more entertaining.                        </div>

                            Just on one little point, I'd say (and I'm going use The Jargon here) that what Vincent &amp; Co. are doing with their <i>Mechaton</i> campaign game is Not An RPG(tm) because all the additional imaginative content they're embroidering around the rules does not (and CAN not) translate into any impact on resolution of fictional events. The "roleplaying-like" content is Color, and can't get turned into System/Situation/Setting/Character without drifting the rules - which they're actually doing in-process with the Space Battle and a few other things, but nevermind).<br><br>This distinction - that imagined content impacts resolution in a meaningful and concrete way - is what distinguishes a "role-playing game" from other fiction-making activities. Consider Capes - in which MOST of the fictional stuff introduced is ephemeral and has no impact on the continuing fiction (it's just a pretext for moving currency around). There are two important exceptions in Capes, though - the "popcorn principle" that lets social contract System enforce the durability of fictional elements beyond moment-to-moment actions, and the persistent Debt/Story Token economy that drives positioning over a larger cycle than the individual moment of resolution. I think Capes is "just barely" a RPG because it has these tools for making fictional stuff "stick."                        </br></br></div>

                            It's not a roleplaying game if you don't, per rules, use creative fictional input to change the flow of the game.<br><br>That's kind of like Ben's definition, I guess.<br><br>Now, playing Mechaton with creative fictional input that has an actual effect on the in-game events means turning it into a roleplaying activity.  The game itself is not a roleplaying game, because it does not tell you how to use creative fictional input.

I guess my thing is, okay, what Vincent &amp; Co. are doing in Mechaton, with their cute little songs &amp; such, doesn't seem so far from what D&amp;D play is often like.  You come up with your character, and your (let's say) 15 pages of backstory doesn't matter much.  And your reasons for doing things, doesn't matter much either, except that you do them.   To the best of my recollection, just about the only time where color really matters in the resolution of D&amp;D is "social scenes," and (until 3.5) there wasn't any mechanical way to handle that.                        </div>

                            James, that's NOT AT ALL my recollection of how D&amp;D used to be played in the Old Days. I know that's very much where it is NOW, but Back In The Day, it was very much about clever use of color details to create mechanical advantage (or to shift resolution away from the mechanics and onto social-level factors). I think that New School D&amp;D is a much more focused and "board-gamey" thing than its ancestors.                        </div>

                            James:<br/>Have you seen S.John Ross' comments on rpgs being defined by the center, not the edges? I'm not saying that I agree with all of his comments, but I kind of like his general line of thinking. It gets over the urge to make things "spectrums" or intersecting rays, or whatever.<br/><br/>Basically, it just posits that there are "qualities" that are associated with rpgs ( of all sorts) and that the more of those qualities that a game has, the more readily a game will be identified as an rpg.<br/><br/>The thing is, a game in question might need x out of y qualities to qualify. A second game might also have x out of y number of qualities, but x are different qualities for the second game.<br/><br/>Plus, different people weigh the individual qualities more heavily.<br/><br/>Here's the link to the S.John Ross thingie I was talking about. It's the second writing section on the page:<br/><a href="http://www.io.com/~sjohn/faq.htm#General%20RPG%20Stuff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.io.com/~sjohn/faq.htm#General RPG Stuff</a> </div>

                            Universalis is not a role-playing game.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sure, people who have a political agenda that thinks that somehow by making the definition of RPG be such that Universalis is a RPG say it's a RPG. I dunno, perhaps out of a fear that if it's labeled something else, it'll be ignored.<br/>
<br/>
But I (and I think Ralph, too), have embraced the idea that it's not a RPG, and I think that's actually helped sales.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you one thing for sure. I start out every demo saying, "First, this is not a RPG. It has some similarities, but it's got some distinct differences." This aids people in getting how to play immeasurably. A ton of baggage drops off right away, and people start thinking about what the game at hand is rather than what they think it should be like.<br/>
<br/>
But that's just propaganda, too, I'll admit.<br/>
<br/>
Here's something that I think is definitive of the tabletop form (that is, distingushes it from CRPGs, for instance). RPGs vary from wargames in that there are places where participant judgment is used to make some determination instead of always having a rule to reference. This enables RPGs to be infinitely more versatile, because you can have an infinite number of inputs. Whereas in any game game, there are limits on the inputs, and anything else done on top of that is solely color.<br/>
<br/>
For instance in a RPG, you can say, "I command my unit to move just ten feet out of the trees. In a hex-based game, you can't do that, because you have to move either into this hex, or that. Even with tapemeasure wargames you can't have the units move off of the board without losing them or something. In an RPG you can. And the GM or somebody will be there to look at the rules and figure out how to apply them to this new situation. Computer can't do that.<br/>

                            Seems to me it's a roleplaying game if the participants are adopting <i>roles</i> (as opposed to playing a board game, for example), are <i>playing</i> (and not involved in improv theatre or a writers' workshop, f'rex), and it's a <i>game</i> (meaning there are actual rules, however simple, governing the resolution of certain interactions).  And to make it a <i>story</i> game, well, there has to be some shared development of a story.  :-)                        </div>

                            Tad, I'd agree, and apparently that's where D&amp;D comes from, historically.  I think the way Vincent, Emily and J. are playing Mechaton represents some lower spot on that ladder: no one's playing a role, but there's a lot more imaginative content than there strictly needs to be.  It's generally irrelevant, from a rules point of view, but there's no question that it's adding massively to their fun.  If coming up with silly songs about mecha were part of the "GM advice" for Mechaton, it would be another step closer...                        </div>

                            James, the act of definition is a political, social event.  Defining roleplaying is an effort to say something about roleplaying (same with defining things as "not roleplaying").  So what purpose do you propose for this act of definition?  Because arguing over who to exclude or include has no solid grounding without a purpose.<br><br>If we want to talk linguistically, based on the way human beings use the word "roleplaying," then that's a whole nother issue and a much, much broader definition (and one that I like more than most of the limited definitions being proposed here).                        </br></br></div>

                            Jonathan, I guess what I'm wonderng is, "Okay, there are three, or thirty, or three hundred designers here.  What *else* does the stuff you design, work for, with a tweak or two?"<br/>
<br/>
Because I think whatever it is that you designing guys are doing, it's a lot broader in application than working through emotional issues, or telling Calvino-style stories.  Like, that might be the intended function, and maybe it fulfils that function to a greater or lesser extent.  But I'm wondering what the practical function is, and what else it's good for.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of think that what y'all are doing, is coming up with a type of social software for artistic collaboration, and it *just happens* to involve stories about lasersharks, for reasons arising out of the history of geek sub-culture.  It's like, an automated system of arbitration, or mediation, or something.<br/>
<br/>
And I'd be curious as to seeing how far it can go in that direction.  My interest isn't about faction politics at all, it's about, what can be done?  And the thing is, I'm not a designer, and don't want to be a designer, so I thought I'd ask the designers.                        </div>

For my part, one where you *do*.  Because that's the way you play it.  A game where you *don't*, isn't being played as an RPG.  Some games can be played in multiple ways.<br><br>And to me, a "role" is persona or personality - and stretching those terms comes across as false; if you're playing "an anthropomorphic ideal", then I'd expect some <i>serious </i>anthropomorphism, darn it.<br><br>But that, again, is me.<br><br>Polaris is totally weird to me.  Because sometimes the participants are primarily playing character roles (RPG), and sometimes they're mainly playing player roles (not).

                            James, I think most RPGs include story-development as a by-product of the <i>playing</i> of <i>roles</i> that Sophie and Joshua are describing, rather than as a central component.  By embodying an imaginary persona (a character, a nation, etc.), and making choices in reaction to an environment or other people playing roles, you end up with a story to tell.   But it's the playing that's important, not the end result, which is part of what makes it different than the other things you describe, such as an engineer game.                        </div>

<p>Man, anything I have to say about this seems to pivot around different kinds of negotiation. Like, I feel like there is a definition of negotiation for which trad-games, with very strict authority patterns (you're the boss of this character, and i'm the boss of this other character, and herbie is the boss of anything no one else is the boss of...), qualify as roleplaying, but the definition of negotiation this requires is so encompassing or vague as to be unrecognizeable.</p>

This is also what makes playing one of these games different from collaborating on a piece of creative writing.<br/><br/>Two of the guys in my PTA game from last year were friends who had worked with me on a couple of writing projects.  On those projects, the whole point of everything we did - the whole point of our collaboration - was to get an end product of a certain quality.  When we played PTA, on the other hand, the end product was not as important as going through the process of spotaneously creating story-stuff.  If it turned out that playing through the game resulted in a "good story" that was gravy.  But it wasn't really our goal, and it wasn't much like the experience of collaborating when we <i>did</i> have that kind of goal in mind.                        </div>

I could very easily see a player taking a non-character, semi-GM type style where they pretty much add scenery, introduce characters, and even steer the storyline a bit without ever really stepping into character in a first or third person sort of way.<br/><br/>Not that I care.

                            So recently I posted in my blog about my idea of a Minimal RPG; that is, a complete role-playing game with as little size and complexity as possible. I wanted to use it as a wall off which to bounce various gaming theories. I wrote this cute little thing for two players about a hostage negotiation.<br/><br/>Then my friend responded with a description of a very short exercise she and classmates did in drama class. <br/><br/>Two people got on stage. One would start by saying "please" any way he wanted. That's the only word he could say. The other would respond by saying "no" any way she wanted. That's the only word she could say. They'd go back and forth until the director ended it or until the "no" person decided to say "yes" instead. There was some thought that the first person was trying to "convince" the second to say yes. The point of the exercise was ostensibly to teach drama students how to express themselves without a lot of language but the social goal was clearly (based on my friend's description) to entertain and impress one's classmates. Good performances would have people crying in joy or sadness and people would erupt into applause afterwards. <br/><br/>So, is that an RPG? I think it fails the test proscribed by Ben and John and Christian. I think it passes the tests that Levy and Jonathan described. I can't decide if it fits Sophie's definition or not. It's improv theater but there are rules and there seems to be a 'win' condition though the "no" person holds all the cards and the "please" person has no game power to force a change.                        </div>

I do disagree that the process ("psychoanalyze," you called it) necessarily kills all forward momentum for craft or art. Musical composers often do study music theory at a very detailed level, deconstructing existing music and studying chord progressions and the like. <br/><br/>I think of it as taking apart the clock to find out how it ticks, so I can use those engineering principles in building my own clock. Taking things apart and putting them back together again is a time-honored crafting process.<br/><br/>Laying down boundaries is useful for purposes of understanding. When we cross over from "that thing isn't a role-playing game" to "so therefore I won't talk to you about what you're doing," that's when the boundaries become harmful -- when they are used to exclude.<br/><br/>Look at what I posted prior. I wrote a very short role-playing game and described a theater exercise for the purposes of saying, "do our game design theories hold for these things and, if not, why not?" Show me how it's not useful to bounce our theories off the edge cases and discuss why certain theories fail. We say our theories apply to a class of activities called role-playing games. If this drama exercise is an RPG and a theory doesn't work for it, we need to revise the theory. That helps us make better games later on because the design theory is better.                        </div>

                            How big does a stool have to get before it is a table? and if I sit on the table does that make it a stool? <br/><br/>Role playing game is not a thing it was a term used to describe a set of things that shared some features. I would be willing to bet that the term came into existence after the practices were started.<br/><br/>The Ramones never set out to make "PUNK ROCK" they wanted to make rock, they were a little different and someone gave it a label then there had to be definitions. What was punk and what wasn't became a rallying cry for those who wanted to be punk and those who wanted to not be punk. Were the Cars punk? What about the MC5? The minute you stop thinking about the punk part you can more easily hear the influences that earlier musicians had on the Ramones. <br/><br/>The term only has use to make something inside or outside the set it defines. Clue can fall into the pot of things we call role playing games fairly easily if you think about being the character but you are manipulating the character even if you think of it as a token andmoving it around.<br/><br/>Scott McCloud, in understanding comics talks about the universal nature to identify faces in images and I think that also holds true for story as well we can and do see story everywhere and saying that one thing is and another isn't a role playing game fails to see the underlying capacity to instill story into all games.                        </div>

How about wrestling? (I think it probably is, if you're trying to use the role + play + game definition - which is why I don't find that a particularly useful definition <i>for my purposes</i>.)                        </div>

                            Professional wrestling fails the "game" test in my mind, unless you are using a highly cynical definition of "game," at which point just about all of life becomes a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>What roles does NASCAR have?

                            There is story applied to the racing. The feudes adn stuff around the race is a large game that millions watch and play into.<br/><br/>And to answer your other question, yes life is a game where we discover the rules throuhg play.  One of my big hobby horse issues lately is that our own personal narrative opens or restricts the choices we allow ourselves to make when dealing with the world.                        </div>

                            Pro-wrestling might be a good example for how you could still have an entertaining game with a railroaded RPG.  In pro-wrestling, the wrestler's aren't trying to see who can win the match -- that's already decided.  What they ARE trying to do is create the biggest, baddest, most colourful characters they can.  They go through with the entire pre-scripted thing, but do it in the most entertaining way they can think of.  The "game" for the wrestler's isn't about winning the match -- it's about the way they do it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this requires that the wrestler's *know* the match has already been decided... if they buy into the illusion of it being real, they'll put their effort into the wrong place in the game.                        </div>

<p>Yeah, as several people pointed out, there's no fictional input into the Battle for Tarkut from the actions in-game. There's output â€” we set stakes at the beginning and now we're scrapping over them â€” but the resolved stakes don't input back into the resolution system. I'd suggest that, with the addition (and this would be no small thing) of a: characters and b: closing the feedback loop between fiction and resoltion, it would be a roleplaying game.</p>
<p>Really, though?</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>I don't bother calling Shock: and Under the Bed  roleplaying games because I just don't care anymore. It's not an interesting debate. It's enough to know that the people who play RPGs play Shock: They also play wargames, like to build with Legos, and like science fiction movies. I made a game for myself and the people who like what I like like the game. It just seemed silly to market it to the wargaming, Lego, or sci fi movie markets.</p>

                            I think an RPG is pretty much whatever you'd put on the shelf near the D&amp;D stuff (yadda-yadda: not miniatures and dice. Not Dragonlance novels, etc.)<br/><br/>It does sound flippant--but I think it's more of a heuristic than a formalized test. Universalis may not "be an RPG" by a lot of 'objective' measures but to say it isn't "identifiable" as an RPG is also being somewhat willfully blind. <br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            There are two issues here:<br/><br/><b>"RPG" as label</b>: It's pretty clear that the term "RPG" is simply a label. So when trying to define the <i>activity</i>, you have to decide whether it's worth maintaining that label.<br/><br/><b>Defining the activity</b>: Now, when attempting to define the activity, there are basically two approaches one can take. First, you can take a historical approach. That is, you can look at how the term has been used in the past. With this approach, pretty much anything that is a descendant of DnD is an RPG. This is includes computer games, and possibly some boardgames.<br/><br/>The second approach is, err... <i>qualitative.</i> You attempt to define the core of the activity as an activity. Some people like to say that it has something to do with "playing a role". Some people here says that it has to do with the recursiveness of the imaginative content. Whatever.<br/><br/>So, before a definition can be made, you have to decide what kind of criteria you're going to use. Both historical and qualitative approaches are valid, and they each make more sense for certain purposes. But obviously, each approach is going to include or exclude certain things that the other would leave out or embrace, respectively.                        </div>

                            This isn't the first time a thread like this has come up on this board (see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1440&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow">here</a> and its cousin <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1263&amp;page=1#Item_26" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  <br/><br/>I'm still not clear, from any of these threads, what effect anyone thinks it will have if the semiotics of the term RPG finally get nailed down. Will it mean you'll refuse to play Universalis because its excluded from your definition? Will it really help design games that are more fun? Really? <br/><br/>I like the comparison earlier in this thread to musical genres, because (as with punk rock) there are certainly activities you can point to and say "yes, this thing is squarely within the bounds of the term being discussed,"  but other examples may draw influence from it, or be on the edges of a perceived definition, and be up for discussion. But <strong> what actually comes of strongly defining the term?</strong>  Is it just a need for definition, on a personal level or something?  Because I'm not seeing the need. Some (so-called) RPGs are fun to me, others are not. Some things that are debateably RPGs are fun to me, others are not. Some things that are games but not RPGs are fun to me, others or not. What will a definition (even supposing one could be arrived at) do to help me have more fun? <br/><br/>I'm not really trying to throw cold water on it if people are enjoying the semantic game of trying to arrive at a definition. Go ahead, but I'd honestly like to know if there's more to this thread (and its predecessors)  or if its just an exercise. <br/><br/>Dave                        </div>

                            Why do I persist in responding to this question? Because I find the qualitative kind of definition useful - it seems to me to usefully enclose a set that has certain common structural features, such that I can look at a design and say "yeah, that's RPG-ish enough to appeal to me" or "that's trying to be an RPG, but it lacks a critical piece for my purposes." It's a handy heuristic of similarity. Recursion between fiction and mechanics = one thing, role assumption = another thing, generation of imaginative content through play = another thing... I think the more metrics we have to describe similarities &amp; differences between things in the general neighborhood of RPG, the more reliably we can identify what we do or don't enjoy, and the more we can develop a meaningful critical framework (of the "does it do what it sets out to do" variety).                        </div>

                            So when something fits in your set of common structural features, and is therefore an RPG to you, you like it? Independent of genre, etc?  That's fascinating to me, as I'm not like that at all.<br/><br/>I guess a problem I perceive is that when a game like Universalis, or Mechaton, or Battlelore - something not in the center of the RPG definition but that has elements related to it - when such a game is being evaluated it seems like more attention is focused on the RPG question and less on the "does it do what it sets out to do" or "is this fun and why" questions. <br/><br/>In other words, I believe I understand you but you haven't convinced me the question's important yet (to me, anyway). I should probably start another thread or withdraw from this one, as I feel I'll just be getting in the way of the rest of you.                        </div>

                            I've miscommunicated, Dave. No, it's not that "it hits my checklist of features, therefore I like it". It's that the more descriptive criteria I can define, the easier it is for me to evaluate how similar it is to other things. I find the domain enclosed by "is an RPG" a useful category with a meaningful difference from "is not an RPG" - even if that domain has fuzzy edges.                        </div>

                            I think one of the earlier posters hit it. No, it's not important to know what an RPG is from the POV of whether or not to include it as an activity. But it might be interesting to know what it is in terms of wrangling with how best to make one. Or even how to break out of the format.<br/>

<div class="QuoteText">I'm still not clear, from any of these threads, what effect anyone thinks it will have if the semiotics of the term RPG finally get nailed down. Will it mean you'll refuse to play Universalis because its excluded from your definition? Will it really help design games that are more fun? Really?</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
I actually have zero interest in whether something's an RPG, and I'm kicking myself for framing the original question in an ambigous way.<br/>
<br/>
I'm mainly interested in RPG-like activities.  Like, back in May, everyone on StoryGames was gaga over Impro.  "Holy crap!  You're playing a role... and making it up... but it's not a game... Weeeeeird!"  And apparently, Clinton and Remi and The Third One started doing impro, for fun, and it turns out that it really improved their play.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I suspect there are a lot of things that are very similar to RPG's, which either I might enjoy in their own right, or might enrich my play.  Methods of oral storytelling, for example, might produce interesting methods of play.<br/>
<br/>
There's no question that chat-based RPG's are immensely different from table-top RPG's in procedural terms; it would be interesting to see RPGs which take advantage of the chat format more robustly.<br/>
<br/>
And so on.<br/>
<br/>
So it's not so much as, "How do you define what an RPG is?" but rather, what ain't one, and what can we learn from it?                        </div>

You want "Near-RPG" coolness?  I'm totally in on that action.<br><br>Oral storytelling.  Straight-up.  It's got formula statements and events, opening with hooks, all sorts of loverly stuff.                        </br></br></div>

                            For me, knowing what isn't a role-playing game keeps me from misapplying RPG theory to it and being frustrated at the result.                        </div>

                            For what's worth, I DO believe this is an important question. I've thought alot about this question over the last year or so, and I've come to the conclusion that historically, we have NOT had a very clear understanding of "what it is we do". I believe coming to a clearer understanding will help us move forward, as it will help show us what direction we should move in to enhance and broaden our play.                        </div>
