Again, thanks for the thorough discussion of my game. I'm really appreciating listening to the analysis.<br><br>I listened yesterday and didn't jot down notes, so I'm working from memory. So, please bear with me.<br><br><b>RACE</b><br><br>Jesse is correct. The point of the Demographics (especially in conjunction with the geographic elements of the game) is to trigger that passive "pattern recognition" part of the mind, which can then be used for grist for storytelling, either by supporting or subverting the stereotype. And it's not always race, either. I've generally found that a particular game of <i>Dirty Secrets</i> will end up being about one of the Demographics, but you can never really predict it before the game starts. For example, one of our playtests had three generations of Chinese characters, which really ended up being about the Age Demographic, as the three generations represented the gradual integration of this immigrant family into the American culture.<br><br>There are a couple reasons for the organization of the Character cards around the board. One is to poke at some of the power relationships that I see in society at large. So, the Law is on top, and the authority tends to run down the board, through the various classes, and finally down to the ex-cons, who are often at the bottom of the political heap (e.g. social stigma, reduced rights in voting if convicted of a felony). Also, in general, the white population of the U.S. is the majority (though that is changing), and I wanted to note that in the divide across the left and right portions of the board. I will acknowledge that different local populations will be different; specifically, I've heard the L.A. black/Hispanic gang conflicts cited on a couple occasions as a counterpoint. So, yeah, it's not a perfect division, but I do think that it is often representative of the general political power held by certain groups. And yes, that's a stereotype. (I also like that the board division provokes this discussion.)<br><br>At the same time, the original reason for the division was much more pedestrian. Early playtests revealed that there was a <i>lot</i> of paper flying around on the table, and, without a system to help keep track of it all, the table quickly became very chaotic, making it difficult to locate the right Crime or Character card. So, some sort of filing system seemed necessary, simply to assist the players in administering the game. But hey, if you're going to do that, then why not tie even that administrative detail into the broader themes of the game?<br><br>And so we did.<br><br><br><b>VIOLENCE</b><br><br/>I find that Violence sequences are often as good for solving "writer's block" as Revelation sequences. I'll look at the Characters and decide, "Hmm. She shows up with a gun." Then, once the dust has settled, you're still left with a question: "Why did she start shooting?" Answering that question can be a productive method of pushing the story to the next stage.<br/><br/>As far as the dice risk to the Authority (or lack thereof) in Violence sequences, I have to say that I hadn't considered that particular set of rules interactions. The whole "moral dilemma" aspect I discovered in play and rather liked. (I <i>think</i> that we documented that in the Handbook...or maybe it was just implied in the example text.) And the dice refresh existed to give the Authority another method to refresh his dice against a strong Investigator. If you can't force a Reflection sequence by winning conflicts and you don't want to yield to the Investigator to regain dice in Investigation sequences...well, try to hurt the investigator and get those dice back!<br/><br/>Personally, I'm okay with the rules interactions as they stand, but I can see why Will wouldn't care for them.<br/><br/><br/><b>A SEGUE INTO THE DICE MECHANIC</b><br/><br/>I don't know if I've ever gone into this before in a public forum, so I'll mention it now. The underlying dice mechanic is supposed to function by analogy to the genre. Basically, the more dice you have, the more information you have to base your decisions on in the Liar's Dice mini-game. So, if I have 5 dice and you have 5 dice, I'm seeing half of the involved dice (and two of the three Violence dice). However, if I only have 3 dice and you have 5 dice, I'm seeing 37.5% of the dice, and you're seeing 62.5% of the dice, giving you an edge. Information superiority is king in the conflict mechanics of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, just like in the genre. The more you know, the better off you are.<br/><br/><br/><b>REVELATIONS AND REFLECTIONS</b><br/><br/>I tend to use Revelations sparingly in my games. They're like hot sauce; a little goes a long way. However, both Revelations and the Crime Grid "murder bingo" are my attempt to balance the two design goals of the game. On the one hand, I wanted a GM-less, low-prep game, because that's what I tend to like to play these days. On the other hand, I wanted a mystery game where the reveal was actually a reveal to the players. Thus the semi-randomness of both Revelations and the Crime Grid. My intent is that use of these mechanics provides the "What the...?" feeling that you get from reveals in the mystery genre.<br/><br/>Also, Reflection sequences are my favorite. Having your investigator visit his father's grave...awesome. That's exactly the kind of thing I intended for Reflections. By the way, IMHO, the proper soundtrack for a Reflection sequence is either <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RScZrvTebeA" rel="nofollow">"Blade Runner Blues"</a> by Vangelis or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg0cmhjdiLs" rel="nofollow">"Memories of Green"</a> by the same composer.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I've played my own game, and I'm starting to wonder if I need to remedy that somehow.<br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279340/#Comment_279340" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T12:51:54+00:00" title="July  5, 2010 12:51PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My issue wasn't with the authority refreshing dice if he one the violence scene and did three points to the investigator. It was if the investigator wins and choose to distribute three points to himself or must if there is a six point difference and only two characters in the scene. The authority should never get dice back after deliberately throwing a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
