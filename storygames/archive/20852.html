Anyway, my game is not a PVP game but it can come up occasionally. This is the one aspect of the game I'm having trouble with and could use some help with. For the sake of simplicity, how would you design a PVP scenario in a PbtA game with no turns? I can give more details about my game if necessary, but I think it will give me enough insight if we can come up with an elegant way in which PVP in a PbtA game would work and I can follow up with specifics if necessary. I think this could also be useful to other Story Gamers who might be looking for a way to incorperate PVP into their PbtA games.

In some ways the flow and adjudication of obstacles or confict are very similar in structure to a PbtA game, in other ways they are vastly different. I just used the PbtA example for simplicities sake and because I thought it would work to give me insight into my own game. Anyway, I was looking for a way to incorporate PVP without turns in a way that mantains fictional context, being that comes up in my game once in a while. I didn't know Vincent had come up with this. A modified version of this will work perfectly in my game! Case closed! It's so simple it's embarrassing I didn't come up with it myself <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thank you!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
