If anyone is interested, please let me know by whatever means you wish. <br/><br/>The game itself is a fast-and-loose, possibly somewhat fantastical, historical-fiction game, set at least ostensibly in post-Norman Invasion England. It centers around clan politics and the ironclad law of the Norman conquerors. The mechanics derive from <i>Otherkind</i> dice, with a few flourishes I've devised in order to focus play on the squabbling, allegiances, and rivalries of the clans, plus some stuff in there to focus on life under tyranny. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-- Zac                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
