But clearly it's impossible to railroad plot without stressing one fictive element or another.  The experience, the <i>story,</i> is emergent and happens on many levels: the plot level is only one of them.  Another is the thematic level, in which case (to get back to the point) the nature of a strong antagonist will <i>absolutely</i> determine or limit the nature of the theme.  It's a thematic rail.<br/><br/>Then again, let me quickly point out: <i>There's nothing inherently wrong with that.</i>  I don't think Rails are Bad.  They are tools, like you say.  I don't necessarily hear a pejorative when I hear the word "rail" or even "railroad".  The question involves artistic intent, grace, playstyle, player buy-in, and other factors.  (Yes I am aware that I also seem to be a minority in this respect.  But Catty asked for opinions, and that's mine.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000" title="johnthedm7000"><img alt="johnthedm7000" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">johnthedm7000</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437829/#Comment_437829" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T05:22:19+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  5:22AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I fail to see the difference between a GM doing an OSR sandbox or someone MCing apocalypse world and coming up with preexisting NPCs prior to play and the designers of a game including specific NPCs as part of a setting in and of itself. <br/><br/>That being said, I think I get where Asif is going with this. Because "canon" NPCs tend to be movers and shakers in their respective settings, there can be pressure (implicit or explicit as with OWOD's metaplot) for the GM to "maintain the status quo" and railroad to secure the NPC's safety and agency rather than playing to find out what happens next. <br/><br/>With that in mind, I would recommend that anyone considering putting "canon" NPCs in their game provide explicit instructions in the rulebook that canon details like that are meant to change, grow, and be destroyed in the course of play. Or as Vincent Baker put it, to be looked at through crosshairs.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437830/#Comment_437830" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T06:57:40+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  6:57AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to not understand what they were, I thought they were like \u201cexample NPCs\u201d.

It is atomic, obsequious, and scattered across many levels of design and performance.  Its ethics and practicality are simply matters of degree and artistic style.  Like GM functions, it may be divided up amongst players, it may be obscured by dissolution throughout the system in more or less obvious places, it can be atomized and tucked away on certain structural levels such that its influences are not perceived as obviously, and any given rail can be made mobile or swappable with different rails, but the use of rails cannot be completely removed or the world will not cohere.<br/><br/>An AW Front has a Countdown Clock which determines what the Front will do if the Players do nothing to affect it.  It will be unavoidable when it happens.  That is a conditional rail with a default setting of "On".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437835/#Comment_437835" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T07:54:23+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  7:54AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you then say that dice are the railroads of mechanics?

Because the game has a shared world and a metaplot. So say the kings and queens of countries do have their set entries and personalities. Including them into your games of course drives towards a certain theme, I would agree, and limits what the players can do to remain in the shared world. If they murder someone who is important for the metaplot the world they are playing in is to a degree different from other players. It often can be worked around.<br/>In the newer books they are giving a perspective for the NPCs not just a snapshot where they are now but what will happen with them and how they will change.<br/>In campaigns they usually put a little sign next to the NPC's description that tells you if they are important for the metaplot later, if you can do with them what you want or if they are considered dead after the campaign. Which is kinda helpful, so you know when you are stepping onto something.<br/>I never hestitated including an NPC I thought fitting into one of my games. I try to make them match the description as I play them, because of the shared world, which is part of the DSA experience. But my players did not try to murder kings that weren't expected to get murdered yet. And some small local person really isn't changing too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437843/#Comment_437843" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T09:34:24+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  9:34AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think of NPCs as fantastic gateways into the mythology of the setting, if the setting has one.

Known throughout the bayou as \u201cThe White King\u201d</i><br/>Trait: Enchanting<br/>* Humor his prey<br/>* Appear out of nowhere<br/>* Sink fangs into warm-blooded flesh and wait<br/>* Sun on a log<br/>* Dazzle with unearthly beauty<br/><br/>That's more than enough to go on for me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437851/#Comment_437851" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T16:20:56+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  4:20PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think their usefulness depends on the game. For example, the NPCs in Unknown Armies actually helped me conceptualize what an adept <i>was</i> and what they might look like. I think those NPCs were vital to my understanding of the game. Some of them are Big Deal Important Canon (which I dislike), but there's a lot of fun riff-raff in those books, and they illustrate the varied underground magick scene really well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437860/#Comment_437860" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T20:51:43+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  8:51PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never seen this done well (because all the attempts I saw were by immature teenagers, or horribly railroading GMs with pet NPCs), and I've never done this myself, preferring to make up NPCs which are imagined so as to play off the PCs' traits and themes.<br/><br/>But in theory I can't see why it couldn't be done.

I still think your definition of "rails" is so broad as to be meaningless, but, ignoring that, you make an interesting point in terms of how a powerfully conceived NPC, when introduced to a given game, forces into play certain thematic connotations and such.

(Also at some points writers with pet NPCs). Still there is the aspect of talking about them. "So did your characters like the Empress Rohaja? She seemed hella incompetent when we met her!" or "How did you kill that evil sorceror Xeraan? Wow! You let him live?!"<br/>So there are some fan favorite NPCs too and some that are pretty universally hated and in that way they are getting attention in publications. Because the authors know about it. It sometimes has more of a soap opera feeling. But that is okay, why not use the metaplot to have a little fun that way and it can all be introduced into the game if you want or well you can just take the outcome that is absolutely necessary for the world to kinda sorta resemble the shared one.<br/><br/>About themes being linked to preexisting NPCs, if they are allready known by the players (or even their characters) it can be a tool to support a theme that developed in play. By introducing those NPCs into it, that are strongly linked with one and fitting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437875/#Comment_437875" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T07:23:16+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  7:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>But in theory I can't see why it couldn't be done.

This actually reminds me of my own Apocalypse World experience, with a similar effect. (Ambergris showed up in that one.) And I thought that was really cool. Like, I remembered Meguey talking up another NPC (I think it was Dremmer) and her impressions of him, and that? That's really neat. That you can have a quasi-shared fiction between everyone, even if it's not actually in continuity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
