I've been eager to (a) introduce her to gaming, and (b) run Sorcerer, so it seems like a natural fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what I'm wondering about: my girlfriend is having a super-shitty year.  She's virtually the last surviving member of her family, and has to take care of some severely disabled relatives, and for various reasons it's been a nightmare these last eighteen months or so.  There are days when she just wants to give up.  Sometimes it's hard to go see movies, because if there's a girl character coping with horrendous family issues she identifies immediately and intensely, and (since girl characters coping with horrendous family issues rarely have an easy time of it in film) it's usually emotionally harrowing for her (e.g., <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow!  Under certain circumstances, it can be fun to escape your worries for a few hours and live vicariously through an imaginary person.  She enjoys a lot of fantasy and sci-fi stuff.  Even fairly intense stuff: there's a lot of awful family crap in the <i>Tomoe Gozen</i> series, but she loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as a possible GM for her, I'm a little leery about presenting particular conflicts, particularly in a Sorcerer face-stabby sort of way.  While it may be cathartic to confront some of her troubles, I don't want to sour a fun time, or (God forbid) make a difficult situation worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone gamed under similar circumstances--either as someone in a sometimes fragile state, or as the loved one or friend of another participant?  What's something to look out for?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Obviously I intend to have a discussion about what troubles her, and what doesn't.  And there will be some pretty clear discussions of Lines, Veils and that stuff.  But I'm wondering if there's anything else to keep in mind.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64482/#Comment_64482" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T17:48:25+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  5:48PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, people usually don't like dealing with things in a game that they're already unhappy about having to deal with in real life....especially if the sales pitch for gaming was "escape your worries for a few hours and live vicariously through an imaginary person."<br><br>So at a guess, the thing you're going to want to look out for is exactly the thing you already say you're leery about:  don't present a conflict if you have a feeling that it'll just be traumatic <i>to the player</i>.

First, think about what movies she's enjoyed going to see with you. Are they things which are light and engaging, with obvious plots and good escapist fun (whether it's explosions or comic romance)? That's probably a good clue for something to aim for in gaming. If she seems to primarily enjoy movies with shallow characters that don't lend themselves to the viewer identifying with them, then maybe you can look for games which are similar. (I can't think of any offhand, but I'm sure they're out there.)<br>\n<br>\nSecond, are you planning to do this as one-on-one gaming, or with a group of friends? In my experience the social aspect of hanging out with a group of supportive friends and having fun is the best thing that gaming can bring to a situation like this, regardless of what the subject matter of the game is. It might be best to stay away from games that have a lot of player-vs-player conflict, and aim for those where everybody works together to defeat the bad guy. Having more people also gives her the opportunity to just hang back and watch a little if things don't 'click' right away.<br>\n<br/>\nGood luck.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
