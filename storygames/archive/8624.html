It looked like a "Generic Indie" system, something I'd seen many times before: descriptors, additional narration, relationships. The style of writing, too, put me off.<br/><br/>However, I'm gradually admitting that, every time I play Houses of the Blooded, I have a <i>really fucking good time</i>. Moreover, I have a really fucking good time within the genre that the game aims for: bloody, romantic court politics.<br/><br/>I first played at Dragonmeet. The GM was some American guy in a hat and waistcoat, seemed really proud of the game, like he'd written it or something. Despite being a short session, it was intriguingly good: it took court politics and made it fun. At the time, I rather churlishly attributed this to the group rather than the game itself.<br/><br/>Then, last week, I played at Conception. This game was <i>absolutely</i> superb: really bloody court politics, lots of romance. I kept noticing little things the game did: for example, the mechanical bonus you get for a romance is one of the largest in the game. It constantly pushes you towards a particular style of play.<br/><br/>So I'm now fascinated by Houses of the Blooded. I think I've seriously underrated it. I realise, by the way, that this entire post reads as a back-handed compliment, but it's a back-handed compliment well intended: I'm now excited by Houses of the Blooded and wanting to play again.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190973/#Comment_190973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T04:44:33+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  4:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've just started what I hope will be a long term campaign.

It's a well thought out game for telling a particular type of story. If you go back and listen to his vid logs on the development of the game you can see how thoroughly Jarrod's 3 questions influence the structure of the game. Designers ought to get the PDF just to see how interlocked his design goals, mechanical structure and play work.

The Manuevers and Duel system is supposed to bring out the dramatich back and forth of feint and riposte in a duel, but I find that it does the opposite. It obstructs the narrative with too much rules. The same is to be said for the Blessings which are this crunchy "KWEL POWERZ" thing that feels out of place in the otherwise (exclusing the sub-systems) rather slim system. Of course a system for Romance on the other hand is an excellent incentive for players to get involved with that kind of play.<br/><br/>And as far as the book is concerned: It's a horrible mess. I've run half a dozen sessions by now and I'm still having a lot of trouble finding a rule when I need it. It's following no clearly discernible structure and it's a mess of fluff ("the ven are real!" - which kinda rubs me the wrong way) and crunch.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's a good game and I did have some fun with it but I'm not sure if the crunch brings out the setting feeling all that well. Too many subsystems seems to obstruct it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191070/#Comment_191070" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T15:25:56+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  3:25PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a really good time with the sub-systems.

We'll have a session for Season actions."</blockquote>Newp.  I never assumed that.  And of course you can jump forward by seasons or years if you want to.  But, in the introduction to the book, on page 9, under the heading "Time" it says:<br/>"This game is not about a constant push toward perfection. It is about doing everything you can in the time you have. There's a clock on your character, constantly ticking. That hour hand always moving toward midnight. It is always later than you think."<br/>This definitely implies that time is or should be a <i>concern</i> in the game.  That there should be something of an undertone of "Oh shit, my character's getting old!  I'm never going to complete my plans before I go into Solace!"  But if the only reason you'd reach solace before <i>years</i> of weekly play is to decide to skip over large chunks of in-game time on purpose... well... that clock isn't actually ticking all that fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191504/#Comment_191504" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-07T12:08:50+00:00" title="February  7, 2009 12:08PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh yeah, I agree that the Solace clock is more...inexorable than swift-approaching...but the point I'm making here is that you have two options here: you can look for ways to interpret the book to make it <em>less fun,</em> or you can look for ways to make it <em>more fun,</em> and I think the choice is pretty obvious.</p>\n<p>I'd also observe that Solace isn't just an issue for the PCs, and 'getting everything done while you still have time' might reasonably mean 'while the necessary allies and/or victims are still ambulatory.'</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191505/#Comment_191505" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-07T13:00:03+00:00" title="February  7, 2009  1:00PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>but the point I'm making here is that you have two options here: you can look for ways to interpret the book to make it<em>less fun,</em>or you can look for ways to make it<em>more fun,</em>and I think the choice is pretty obvious.</blockquote>Or you could tweak the aging rules to make it more fun.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193058/#Comment_193058" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T07:58:29+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  7:58AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to confirm a few things.<br/><br/>Roll a d6 each Year.

As in "seasons of the year" and also as in "seasons of a character's life."  It'll take about a full real-life year to finish a season of your character's life.  I think the game text also calls these chunks of time "phases" but (except for Solace) they're named after the seasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
