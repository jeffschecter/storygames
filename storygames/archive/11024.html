Everyone, including you, coughs up $23 or so ($20 per person plus tax. Far, far less if you use online retailers like my LGS "scifigenre.com", or Amazon). Twenty bucks ain't so bad. The game stays with you (the GM), so you can bone up on the rules.<br/><br/>Play a campaign over at the minimum like 4 sessions or so. The first session will be the throwaway of learning the rules, the next 4 will be your adventure/mini-campaign.<br/><br/>Re-evaluate. Did you enjoy it? Was it "enough"? If so, sell the game! List it on Craigslist or BoardGameGeek for less than the going rate. Looking at Amazon, I'd sell it (in great condition) for like $50 or so. <br/><br/>Split the remaining money up amongst the players.<br/><br/>Total investment in the game: $10. Not bad at all.<br/><br/>If some folks loved the game and some didn't, maybe propose a buy-out plan: Return $10 to each player who doesn't want to continue playing, coming from the pockets of the people who do. Maybe have a $10 buy-in for the next (replacement) player at the table.<br/><br/>Anyway, you can make it work if you try. After a campaign I've got in the works, I just might do the above myself early next year.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244418/#Comment_244418" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T13:02:38+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  1:02PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the make-or-break question being: Who, finally, gets to keep it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244421/#Comment_244421" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T13:04:29+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  1:04PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm to lazy to consider how this affects the math, but the game is set up for 1 GM and 3 players.

Rules, GM Guide/Bestiary/adventure, Magic Book, Religion Book, a metric buttload of cards (many printed double sided), a number of THICK chipboard standup figures with bases and heavy cardboard Stance Rings to put the bases in, a mess of the cardboard puzzle pieces to assemble stance tracks and progress tracks, and a ton of double sided, multi colored tracking tokens, plus the dice.  Which is a pretty goodly amount of stuff.<br/><br/>The cards include the action deck from which you select your powerz, a smaller size talent deck which you can slot your special abilities into your character sheet or the party sheet (to let everyone get the advantage of having you along), a Wound deck full of nasty criticals, an Insanity Deck (cuz this is WH after all), a Magic mishap deck (ditto), a deck of locations (like "dirt road" "copse of trees"), and a deck of special magic items (which is admittedly a bit unnecessary...how many parties are going to be walking around with Sigmar's Hammer...but perhaps a taste of a plan to release boosters of item cards in the future.)<br/><br/>I will note some disappointment with the dice.  They are of the very hard (feels like it would be brittle) kind of plastic, a little on the light side, and some of the dice in the demo set actually had flash that needed to be removed with a knife...which I have to say, I've never seen dice with flash before.  I'll also note, that while there are plenty of dice included to play, you will probably find yourself sharing a few (especially if everyone is maxing out the same stance and thus everybody is grabbing for red dice) so a dedicated group would likely find it convenient to get a pack of extra dice or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244635/#Comment_244635" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T10:41:10+00:00" title="December  2, 2009 10:41AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>a taste of a plan to release boosters of item cards in the future</blockquote>Red Alert! *BWOOOP* *BWOOOP* Red Alert!<br/><br/>Man... ya really think?

Full color image of an archetypical member of that career and all of the career like stuff you need to know.  This is nice because it saves having to copy all that stuff down on your character sheet and it means you don't have to look through a bunch of expansions for that career (no "dammit, was the Spell Singer class in the Players Handbook 3 or The Arcane Powers 4 book..." issues, you just take the new career cards and put them in the stack with the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a pad of 1/2 sized character sheet tear offs.  With so much info on the cards and career card, the actual character sheet is pretty small.  I initially thought the number of sheets provided was unrealistically large, but it seems the expectation is for you to start a new sheet with each career change. Still, nice to have the player sheets included in sufficient quantities with no need to copy or download anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was slightly mistaken on indicating that there was a deck of item cards, apparently there is only the one which was intended as an example of how you could make items of power.  But that's good, because it means there are more cards of the sort that are actually useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also 3 or 4 (I didn't count them) collapsed tuck boxes with colorful WH inspired decorations on them.  They are meant to store your character between sessions.  Career card, character sheet, action cards, tokens, your stance track, and your dice collection will all fit nicely inside the box.  I haven't tried, but it looks like the 4 tuck boxes will then fit nicely inside the game box.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also uncovered a printed out note indicating that the dice included in the game were not up to FFG's standards so they included a replacement pack for the d10s (the Red and Green Stance Dice), which I feel compelled to mention having highlighted the dice flaws above.  It doesn't look like my d10s were that bad, so "yay for extra dice".<br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping to find a wall sized map poster of the Old World hiding at the bottom of the box, but no such luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention that the box comes with a slip cover?  Yeah, it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244891/#Comment_244891" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T12:04:32+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 12:04PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy - and others that discussed leadnign the game out to the players that were buying it:<br>\n<br>\nOne issue with the choice to "Board-Gamerize*" this rpg is that it has Components that can not be lost. or rather canbe lost quite easily and there is no record of what they are. <br>\n<br>\nIf the game came with pages to copy and clip out, or a list and it recommened each player to make his own action card deck, I would be just as disappointed, but would not be as frusterated.

Just last night I was thinking, "This game SO needs multiple rulebook PDFs so that all folks can reference them" (in the same way I'll go to BGG and download the rules for boardgames and print them out so all the players can read them along together).
