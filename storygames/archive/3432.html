A player who was roleplaying a renegade (ex-muskateer) was woken by crashing sound and went to investigate. As the Chronicler (GM) I decided that we should find out if his character is successful in his investigation. We discussed why we thought his character might succeed, some reasons we thought that his character might fail, what would be interesting for the story, and he told us how his character was going to go about investigating the noise. After this brief discussion we all added various amounts of coloured beads to a bag (depending on what they thought should probably happen) and the player roleplaying the renegade drew three of them at random. The result of the draw was a failure with positive consequences. Which basically means that the player got to narrate how his character failed in his investigation, but something good happened for his character nevertheless. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the player narrated a scene where his character got lost and accidently stumbled in on a priest having sex with a boy.  At this point, I stepped in and used my authority as GM to veto the scene unless the player had a damn good reason for it. The player claimed he was going to blackmail the priest and rescue the boy. But it was pretty obvious to most of us at the table that the player wanted to narrate the scene because he thought it would be amusing to have such a shocking and controversial scene. As far as humour goes, I think that nothing is off limits. But there's a time and a place for all kinds of humour and this wasn't it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy decision to veto his narration resulted in a sulk that lasted for the rest of the session and soured the experience for some of the other players. It was as though I had stepped over the line by refusing to allow a player complete freedom in how he narrated his characters involvement in the scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules of my game states that the GM can veto players narration and story suggestions if they do no fit in with the setting, theme, or if they contradict facts established in earlier scenes. Although the GM has this veto, the GM cannot tell a player how to narrate their own characters involvement in the scene. There is also rules for changing the GM during play. This means if players feel the GM is abusing his/her authority or the GM or players just feel like having a change they can go ahead and get a new GM  from amongst the players at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping the players sense of humour aside, do I need to change my rules about GM's veto? I like the idea of players having freedom to narrate their own characters involvement in a scene. But I feel that if a player narrates an inapproriate scene (e.g. a laser cannon being used in a high fantasy setting) someone should be able to say that it is not allowed. <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I get rid of the GM's veto and give the players total narrative freedom?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77413/#Comment_77413" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T05:33:38+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  5:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GM veto isn't the issue here.

That's an important distinction. Veto is just saying "no". <b>No one</b> likes that. OTOH, fiat can be a powerful tool for good. I confess I don't see the humor in the example, but it seems like it could have been an interesting thread for the characters to explore. Knowing nothing about the setting, I'd look to <i>why</i> the priest was engaged in pedophilia. Was he possessed by a literal or figurative demon? It's also interesting that the player intended for his character to blackmail the priest (an unethical act, as opposed to killing him or turning him over to the authorities) and rescue the boy (an ethical act). I would have pushed very hard on that dichotomy. Make it difficult or even impossible for the character to do both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77421/#Comment_77421" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T06:45:19+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  6:45AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did talk it through with the rest of the players before vetoing it.

The humour the player was trying to derive from it was the shock value, e.g. laughing at the other players reactions. You know like when your a child and any swear word is hilarious because its taboo. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe priest being engaged in pedophilia was entirely concocted for the reasons I stated. Blackmailing the priest and rescuing the boy were excuses for the scene, but not reasons. I have made it clear in the rules that the motive is not the object and it is the object which should be of primary concern in most situations. But it occured to me that in this circumstance the motive did matter. It mattered because saying yes to it would open the gates to more silliness. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like your solution. It was certainly more elegant than mine. But even if I could redo the scene again, I still don't know if I would use the solution you put forth because I'm not at all convinced the player was interested in exploring that dichotomy. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, the setting is a fantasy city a few years before an uprising. The players roleplay characters that are supposed to defy corrupt authorities and in doing so inspire the revolution that will happen in the near future.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77436/#Comment_77436" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T08:03:05+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:03AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 8:03AM by Meserach.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MJGraham</cite>I did talk it through with the rest of the players before vetoing it.

Has anyone ever used this rule, in any of the playtests you've run? It seems really unlikely that players will remove <i>the GM who wrote the game they are currently playtesting</i> from the main role of authority, even if the rules technically allow it. Maybe in a finished game, this might be possible, but the social dynamic in a playtest situation seems like it would make this option more or less impossible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77676/#Comment_77676" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T23:18:58+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 11:18PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 11:22PM by noclue.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MJGraham</cite>I did talk it through with the rest of the players before vetoing it.

I would be surprised if they were actually comfortable, but its not really relevant. You were uncomfortable with the scene. That should be enough. They may have been able to deal better if you just said "Sorry folks, this theme is not something I'm comfortable roleplaying. Can we drift this away from pedophilia? How about necropilia?

Restrictions are safe. I don't think their discomfort is about wanting more narrative control. It is more likely about negotiating boundaries on social behavior.

I am so there. Tell me more about your game?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, what most people said is good. I think, though, that the problem is that you're thinking of yourself as the only "leader" in the game.<br/><br/><em>Every</em> player in your game should be able to step up and say "Woah, hold on, this is really squicking me in a bad, uncomfortable way. Time out. I have a problem here, so let's talk it over."<br/><br/>It shouldn't be a GM-only tool and a GM solution, because that requires the GM to read minds and know when other players are getting squicked. It should be something that's open to everyone, not as a tool <em>in the game as players</em> but as <em>human beings who have a right to feel safe and non-squicked while gaming.</em><br/><br/>I need to write a post, sometime, about my experience two game sessions ago being sexually harassed in-character. It's more a Knife Fight kinda post, but I'm not doing KF right now. The experience made me think, though, that there <em>should</em> be a "safeword" rule explicit in every roleplaying game group's social understanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
