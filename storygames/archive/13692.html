I'm thinking of post-apocalyptic scenarios - a modern setting, but the apoc itself is less relevant.  Maybe it's zombehs, maybe a plague, maybe the economy bottomed out and everything went to pot.  Now the protagonists are wandering around and looting and setting up safehouses and forming relationships with each other.<br/><br/>What are some common/uncommon events that could happen?  Examples: wandering (hit a bandit-staged roadblock, find a stash of stuff, encounter a new character, weather turns bad) or chilling (supplies are running low, floodwaters rise, foreboding dreams).  Think Oregon Trail, Night of the Living Dead, Sim City, Roadwarrior.  If anyone can recommend a sourcebook or gamebook with a nice list of Things That Can Happen To Travellers/Settlers that would be awesome - most RPGs focus on random encounters instead of the vagaries of fate and luck.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309732/#Comment_309732" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T10:28:17+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 10:28AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think about things that the players need and remember the rule of 3's.<br/><br/>The rule of 3's states that you're in trouble if you go:<br/>3 minutes without air<br/>3 hours without shelter (think hot, cold, wind, hail)<br/>3 days without water or sleep<br/>3 weeks without food                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309736/#Comment_309736" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T10:40:52+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 10:40AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Veav</cite>If anyone can recommend a sourcebook or gamebook with a nice list of Things That Can Happen To Travellers/Settlers that would be awesome</blockquote>\nHave your played played the game "Fallout 3"?<br/><br/>If not, then STEAL ALL THE IDEAS FROM FALLOUT 3.

If there aren't, could there be?<br/><br/>And, to take that to more of an extreme, you could ask your players directly exactly the types of things they want to see happen.<br/><br/>If none of this works, search through the various post apoc threads on RPG.net. There's lots of them, and lots of ideas there. But I would encourage you to start with your own and your players' interests first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309806/#Comment_309806" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T16:44:03+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  4:44PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Veav</cite>Now the protagonists are wandering around and looting and setting up safehouses and forming relationships with each other.
