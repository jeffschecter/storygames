I also think the subtleties of how a game uses dice is important. I hear the term \u201cdice bias\u201d tossed around, I haven\u2019t read enough of the archives to know what that means exactly. Could someone explain it to me?<br/>\n<br/>\nclearly story structure and chaos are kind of strange bed fellows, use dice incorrectly and your story  could rapidly shift genres.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I\u2019m interested if you feel the way dice are used can have positive effects on a player's ability to tell stories or a player's emotions at the table?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the angle of game design that focuses on a player's direct physical or mental activity (as opposed to Fictional activity). The different die types and methods of rolling really effect player activity. This school of thought is why mario plays the same story over and over. who cares, it's all about player activity. I think this angle is maybe lacking in story games? (not sure)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote about dice for <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.seedrpg.com" rel="nofollow">my blog</a> and I was wondering what people here thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tyler                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289791/#Comment_289791" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T08:30:29+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  8:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want dice to tell me what happens, not if something happens. That's about what it comes down to. I love that dice produce random results creating an unpredictable story, so I get the fun of discovering what happens just as I'm creating what happens. What I don't want is whiff - to attempt to do something and have the dice tell me it doesn't happen. At least if the GM says it doesn't happen, assuming you trust him you know there's probably a good reason. When I'm GMing if I say no it's because I've thought of something specifically that ties up and explains what has been happening and that messes with it, there's a certain amount of consistency required once certain events have been set in motion, so I assume that in general another GM would do the same thing, and so far as an adult I've found nothing to suggest that this isn't standard practice. Interestingly enough, along those lines, I find that when dice rules seem to be designed to compensate for "bad" players or GMs, it's the GM who ends up having to compensate for the bad dice rules.<br><br>So can dice have a positive effect - absolutely, but the way they're usually used they can have a negative effect, and if you randomly decide when to roll and when not to roll in a task based simulationist system it makes the game seem pointless, like you're using cheat codes intermittently in a video game. In a narrativist conflict resolution based system like HeroQuest though, GM fiat to just make the game progress in a positive fashion is assumed by the system.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289833/#Comment_289833" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T09:43:34+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:43AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want dice to be the creative spark in a game! This could be classed as random but also creative, Fiasco creates a moment in the game called the <b>Tilt </b>Here the dice are rolled and creative complications are added.<br/>\nI like the big visual scenes, complications which can appear from dice if used in that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI seen a film once were the two main characters male female had to escape from a hotel room four stories up. They manage to free them selves (I think from a bed) but were still manacled together (wrist chain wrist.) When the guard returns,while the door is being opened she lowers him out of the window, she follows but slips but he stops her fall and swings her to a hand hold.<br/>\nWell they fall and swing and lots of cool stuff which ends in them both sliding down a cable from the hotel.<br/>\nThe complication of the manacle was used to escape with good effect.<br/>\nThe use of the manacle in that way was the creative thinking of the characters. They could have tried to close-line the guard or depending on the genre cut a hand off Saw style. not nice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
