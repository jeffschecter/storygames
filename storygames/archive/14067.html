It was probably the single most concentrated dose of gaming I've had in my life (haven't been able to start any real games down here, or find a decent community for it), and it was probably the best means by which I learned a whole lot about both playing games, and running games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be heading up again this year, which will be swell, but I think my primary idea is to maybe set up scheduling a bit better, or pre-planning times for games. Even just a more formalised version of the loose "hey, we'll be running [game] at this time, put your name down if you want to play" system that was going on last year. As much fun as it was hanging around with everyone in the games room, it'd be cool to be able to have a time in my head as to when I'll be getting to play the latest indie sensation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322010/#Comment_322010" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T21:58:34+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  9:58PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it wouldn't hurt to have some more organized play.
