                    I posted this in another thread (Non-GenCon Awesome) where it would be easily overlooked and over at the official PTA forum at the Forge where I thought it wouldn't have been easily overlooked, but haven't gotten any replies, so I thought I'd throw my question here.<br/><br/>I'm interested in using Primetime Adventures for at least the first game session in my group's Shadowrun game.  I'm hoping to get some real juicy character development and see how the players want their characters to react with each other and others in the company they'll work for.  I'm interested in the letting other players take over narration, but I'm not certain how that would work in the game.  PTA appears to be a game where there's role-play, a conflict comes up, we resolve the conflict, then we role-play through the conflict, even though we already know how the conflict will play out.  <br/><br/>Here's the longer version of the post:<br/><br/>The introduction of PTA seemed to go okay with the group on Saturday. We finished up our D&amp;D game and started to talk about the SR game. It was a bit of a selling session -- two of the players in the group had grown up on the GM is god and we poor players only roll dice to see if we affect the game world in minute ways. One of these players is my wife and I sold her on the game system the night before. My pitch was about three points: I wanted a game where there was more gameplay input from the players, one were actions weren't so granular, and one where stakes are involved rather than "if I roll high, I hit the orc; low, I miss". PTA seems to have all these.<br/><br/>We're planning on doing the game using d20s for task resolution -- 1-10 gets a hit, 11-20 is a miss; high die indicates who has authority over a scene. Ties resolve by odd/even instead of hearts/diamonds. The player who didn't attend wants us to play using cards as a resolution mechanic because that's what it is in the book, but giving the players a radically different outlook on how to play was a hard enough sell that if I said, "oh, and I'll be taking your dice away" it would have ended in mutiny. (The player that wanted to use cards has an outlook on games and game systems that says one uses exactly what's in the printed rules.)<br/><br/>It's going to take us a little bit to get used to the narrative authority issue. (Even I am a little concerned with how that will play out.) They got stakes rather easily, but it took them a bit to get their heads around non-combat stakes. My example was of a US Marshall escorting a prisoner on a plane. The Marshall's issue was one of appearance: she wants to be seen as calm, cool, and professional. She's a person that's always in control. The prisoner somehow gets her pistol away from her. So now we go to Stakes on a Plane: If the Marshall wins, she slams the criminal down, gets her gun back, and looks damn classy doing so. If she loses, she still slams the criminal down, gets her gun back, but something happens that makes her look either incompetant or unprofessional while she does so. They all sort of got that no matter what she rolled, she'd still succeed in the combat action, but perhaps not in the issue action.<br/><br/>So, to that question.<br/><br/>Does anyone have Actual Play links that shows how the narrative authority works in the game? I've come across dozens of PTA AP, but they're all high-level AP posts that don't really show the post-conflict narration in detail enough that I can say, "Aha! That's how a game session would feel!" Right now, it seems like a player at the table suddenly becomes GM for a few minutes right after we resolve conflict, but it really doesn't matter because we've already found out how the stakes and conflict resolve.                </div>

                            This doesn't exactly answer your question, but the original PTA used d10s for resolution. Odds were successes, and narration went to the player with the highest die result. Tie-breaking was done by looking at the next-highest number. Cards were used for the revised edition due to being a bit easier to handle (they enable play in a moving car, for one), and easier to acquire.                        </div>

                            Hey, Tom, <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I feel your pain. Here's how we did it:<br/><br/>Basically, we role-played up to the conflict. After rolling the dice, however, (we were playing 1st ed), the player that won narration won narration. That means that player gets to say <i>everything</i> that everybody does, gets to add any revelations or plot twists, gets to add content, everything. For just a few moments (up to the point where the player leans back with an "i'm done" look on his/her face), everything that happens is his responsibility. Sure, the other players can offer suggestions and kibitz a little, as usual, and no one at the table was ever asshat enough to describe another character's action which that character's player strongly disagreed with.<br/><br/>Also, we didn't necessarily end the scene immediately after the "i'm done" moment. Sometimes, we'd get back to role-playing in the scene for just a little bit longer. At one time, there were actually two different conflict in the same scene.<br/><br/>This may seem a little shocking, but please bear in mind that this is how <i>we</i> did it It is by no means an "official" answer, but it worked rather well for us. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>J.                        </div>

                            I've been using "narration rights" more like "Game Moderator"-rights. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, once the cards are on the table, everbody throws in ideas and suggestions as to how this may play out. Especially how they envision their characters to deal with the situation. The player with narration rights gets to cherry-pick from the suggestions (including his own of course) and making sure the scene ends in a cool and fun matter, that everybody is excited about. <br/>
<br/>
It's the back-and-forth during the game (including what happens after a conflict) that make the game so much fun for me. But I've noticed that  a great number of gamers I've played this game with, had trouble getting into the right mindset. They'd usually defer to the GM-equivalent the first moment they could and just stop talking until they were encouraged to do speak up again. It's very weird.                        </div>

                            We play it like this:<br/>
<br/>
After setting the scene, there's free play for a while, until someone - usually the producer - calls for conflict.<br/>
We discuss the stakes. Sometimes this is very easy; sometimes we take up to five minutes to hash it out, especially for group conflicts.<br/>
We draw cards and make sure everyone knows who narrates what, and what stakes are won/lost.<br/>
Those who get narrative authority say what happens, how stakes are/won lost, and - note! - how the different traits are used.<br/>
The rest listen, give suggestions, chuck in fan mail, frown at stuff that doesn't work, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing about narrative authority is that you <i>don't have to make it all up yourself</i>; it can go like this:<br/>
<br/>
"Okay.. we run up to the cave, and there's the bear... Maria pulls out her bow... hm, now what? Any ideas?"<br/>
"How about that unicorn from last scene? he can arrive now?"<br/>
"Mmm... no, I don't want him in here yet."<br/>
"I know. There's two bears!"<br/>
"Yes, excellent! Okay, so we sneak in, taking care not to wake the bear. And then there's this growl..."                        </div>

<p>We play it much like JoÃ£o does.</p>
<p>Notice that if you <em>attend</em> to the TV metaphor, it helps - PTA gives you a lot of tools by using that metaphor with which to obtain player agreement to stuff and keep everyone imaginatively on the same page. Use strange cuts; describe the camerawork. Metaphors help us understand what is going on!</p>
<p>More importantly, the TV metaphor helps a lot with rehabilitating "my guy syndrome" sufferers.</p>
<p>Also pay attention to what Matthijs just said. When you win authority, you get to be the buck-stopper, but that doesn't mean that you are suddenly an island; if you talk to the other players, get their input, and so on, then you will get their buy-in, and also probably have better narration for it.</p>
