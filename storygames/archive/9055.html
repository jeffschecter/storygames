I've played Sorcerer a number of times, but its almost always been under the modern version with "demons" as actual demons, the group all tied together by some cabal or cult or whatever, and the situation has always been around some mystical-underground shake-up designed by the players' kickers.<br/><br/>Now that the assumptions are a little bit different, should I just let the situation come out of proposed kickers, or should I really have a situation built up?  Should I set everyone down, we kind of mash out setting details, and then ask - "what do you want to do?", or should I do something more like "Here's a rip-off of <i>Beyond the Black River</i> (or <i>Red Nails</i>, or insert whatever awesome REH story is on my mind at the time), why are your dudes there and what stakes do they have in this situation?"<br/><br/>Any advice is appreciated!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200320/#Comment_200320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T05:33:54+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  5:33AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Create a one-sheet, then build from the kickers.

Establish a look &amp; feel, probably in a few short phrases. This can be a single-person led thing or a group thing.<br/><br/>2. Make up characters. They are, by definition, far more detailed and vivid than the content of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. They should reach into the player's own fantasy-needs, consistent with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> but more about the player than about <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as a concept.<br/><br/>3. Using the character's Kickers, the GM arrives at a locale and scenario prep. Another way to look at this is that the character sheets help generate Situation, and the GM uses Situation to generate a detailed bit of Setting.<br/><br/>4. Play. Situation resolves and vast amount more of Setting is established. The characters also develop and perhaps change.</blockquote>\nBecause I ran a convention game, I deviated from this.  But if I were to run a more straight up game, that's what I would do.  As Kaare notes, it's Characters &gt; Kickers &gt; Situation prep.  But I really want to tap that part about "reaching into the player's own fantasy needs."  That's in the book, and I'd really love to give vent to the that in play some day.<br/><br/>Another note from Sorcerer &amp; Sword is that the situation is usually rather "local" -- like a Conan story.  It isn't, "There's a War of the Ring ranging across Middle Earth"... It's, "This event is happening on this coast/town/city" or whatever.  And then the next story moves the characters to another local.  But this will be influenced by the Characters' Kickers, of course.<br/><br/>Christopher                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
