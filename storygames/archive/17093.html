There's a deck for players skills, special abilities, equipment, etc. And I'm thinking there would probably be a GM deck with rules that help escalate the situation or bring twists into the plot. There could be cards with secrets the players have to keep from each other... my, so many cards that this could actually be a CCG, which is actually going beyond the original idea I had for this game, in a good way.<br/><br/>The contents of each player's card are more or less hacked from AW. That means, each card feature what happens when you roll a 12, a 2, a success and a miss with 2d6. I'm not using a difficulty number stated by the GM, instead dice are rolled against each other (using dice of 2 different colors for this) So, there aren't modifiers in the game either. So the card contents would look like this:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am the silence</span> (movement): You can move with such agility and stealth that your enemies doesn't nottice until it's too late<br/><br/><b>Double 6:</b> You can position exactly where you want, without calling attention.<br/><br/>Success: You get close to your target but the GM chooses one:<br/>-Somebody feels there's something fishy going on and will stay alert.<br/>-The place where you're now won't be safe for too long.<br/>-You've gotta move soon or your target would get out of reach.<br/><br/><b>Miss:</b> You can't reach your target and the GM chooses one:<br/>-Somebody feels your presence and walks towards where you are hiding.<br/>-There's no way to reach your target without calling attention.<br/>-You drop something important and recovering it will deffinitely call undesirable attention.<br/><br/><b>Failure:</b> You trip, drop or step on something that makes too much noise. If there was anybody around they definitely heard you.<br/><br/>Ok, so I'm wondering if you know of some other games like this, something I should definitely be hacking or if you have any interesting ideas for skills, equipment and other resources. Many thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
