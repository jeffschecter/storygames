Neutral Ground, a popular game space, closed down. We have nerdnyc's GGG but that's on specific fridays where we rent space. And with many lay offs, more and more groups are losing office spaces to play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've seen a huge influx of gaming groups in indoor public spaces. I've been playing random games at Citigroup Plaza on the occasional Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and at times there are easily 2-6 other different groups playing as well (usually playing D&amp;D; 4E or Pathfinder and there are also lots of knitting clubs).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur tables seem to attract lots of random people who don't know what roleplaying is to inquire what we are playing. I think when we play Dogs, the massive pools of dice usually attract people. Or maybe our loud gestures and expressions. Either way, people usually say: What are you doing? What are you playing? It looks like fun! Or it looks like you are having fun! It happened twice tonight (we pointed them to lumpley.com). And four times last week. Not including the other people playing D&amp;D; who wanted to know what we were playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt almost makes me want to organize (I'm already organizing so many things! ahhhr!) permanent weekly games in public spaces where when people ask what we are doing, we can say... sit down for a minute and find out!<br/>\n<br/>\nEach time people ask, I usually spurt out something like, it's a game where you play stories using dice like a boardgame. Or it's like improv but a game. I rarely describe the actual game (Dogs or otherwise)... it's a game where you act out teenage mormon virgin priest cowboys judging good people doing bad things for good reasons!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what attracts people mainly is that we appear to be friendly people socializing in fun ways and there are colorful things on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's a good way to hook or excite people?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221543/#Comment_221543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T22:05:11+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 10:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 10:11PM by ColinC.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say "We're using this game to make a story together.

I think playing in more public spaces would demystify the hobby in a potentially good way. Although I feel we would have to tone down the content in many cases. <br/><br/>I suspect many interested people are looking for people to hang out with as much as they are looking for games to play. The last few one day con events we ran, we stopped advertising because we were afraid of reaching the space's capacity of 90 people. Space is definitely an issue. Even if we started attracting too many people to our games in the indoor public spaces we use, they can kick us out :-(\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>I'd say what colin said, with the added *hand them copy of game you are playing* "take a flip through it." this gives them the ability to hover and appear to be  occupied while they listen in on what you're doing for a second. way less scary than actually pulling up a chair and commiting to listen for a signifigant span of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ColinC</cite>I'd say "We're using this game to make a story together.

I do agree that people often are more interested in fiction than the specific details of a die mechanic. But people are picky about their fiction the way they are picky about what movies they watch. I've seen many people turned off by the fictional content of Dogs or Mouse Guard. I'd want to convey the possibilities of the medium without associating it too closely with one specific fictional instance. Like how you would describe the experience of going to a movie theater without describing a specific movie or talking about how movies are made. Bu I might be wrong. It might be useful to use a fishing tactic... ask them what was the last good movie they saw (easier to answer than what is your favorite movie) and talk about a game's setting that matches that style. <br/><br/>What else can we do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221596/#Comment_221596" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T07:23:06+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  7:23AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're making up stories, the way kids do, but because we're adults we like things more complicated. Haha. So we use some rules to help us make up characters, set up fun situations for them, and then we figure out what happens. It's exciting! Sometimes it's tragic or funny or scary. <br/><br/>The dice? Oh, that helps make things more exciting because we don't know what will happen next.<br/><br/>It's more complicated than some games, like RISK or Monopoly, sure, but you can pick up the rules pretty quickly. Most people learn by jumping in and winging it. We're not competing against each other so you can't really lose.

So when we went to talk to the building management, we weren't sure whether to argue from first principles ("We weren't bothering nobody") or try to drive a wedge between us ("no we're not playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, ha ha, Dogs in the Vineyard is, like, a <i>Story</i> Game").<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of the people who have approached us have asked us if we're playing D&amp;D;, and I don't think we had a cogent answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that one woman was definitely thinking about buying <i>Dogs</i>, which made me take a look at the rules afterward to see how well they explain things to game-virgins.

For example, games where the audience has a powerful and entertaining role. Or we could tie games to relatable ideas. Maybe games that are set in the actual place we are playing. Or games that can help people build skills for job interviews, dating, asking for a raise, negotiating contracts or whatever. Just trying to think big and different.

Good to know!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed on the scale and order of things. I agree interest doesn't necessarily translate into participation which doesn't necessarily translate into spreading the hobby. But in the last 5 years many people who have attended our 1 day game event Recess were people who never gamed before that many of us met on subways, book stores, or comic shops. Talking to our local game stores, they often have people ask them where they can find people to play with. Complete Strategist tends to point them to nerdnyc and the meet-up website. But we've found that these people will attend events if we organize them but not organize games themselves. Space is also an issue. If we get huge interest, where do we direct people to?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last 2 years we've actually had to stop marketing our events! Hahahahaha. Because of the space limits!<br/>\n<br/>\nMainly guessing (and I suspect all these numbers are way too low)... I'd say we have easily over 1,000 active gamers in nyc. But probably over 2-5,000 inactive or former gamers. And many more people who have heard about it and would be interested. When I used to work in music, I was very open about gaming and many of the artists and fans would bombard me with questions about what roleplaying was and how it worked. A lot of my friends from various punk rock scenes have always wanted to game. Many of my sister\u2019s friends who love Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings have asked me frequently about gaming, You can tell that they want to play but are not sure how to take that first step. Just tapping into the existing comic book and wrestling fan base in NYC would probably produce terrifyingly large numbers. Hell, the local improv and theater scene would be ever larger! I know so many writing circles that have expressed interest in games like PTA. And I have theater friends that run games before their improv shows to warm up!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been reluctant to step up nerdnyc to the next level because although the potential interest is huge, space, time, and people willing to take lead and organize is very limited. And this interest doesn't necessarily translate into cash flow to run an organization. I bet we could inspire hundreds of people to play PTA and most wouldn't buy other games or visit a game store. I don\u2019t think interest is the obstacle. At least not in NYC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221802/#Comment_221802" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T09:29:25+00:00" title="July 31, 2009  9:29AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, I know Matt Wilson is also very eager to play more games in public.

Something familiar and accessible like some kind of game show or reality show.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Democritus</cite>I think it would be awesome if it would work without any props at all. Maybe some rock paper scissors or placing the card on a flat surface and just turning it for different states (like "tapping" (tm) )</blockquote>\nI lean towards this solution. If you really want a dice-like mechanic, just add check boxes to the cards labeled 1-6. Instead of rolling dice, just check off a box that hasn't been checked yet. When they're all checked, refresh and start over.<br/><br/>But I was really thinking of something more like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3520/3777114855_3da32d4031_m.jpg"/><br/><br/>A deck of four cards with the game's rules on the back and a different character on the front. A different emotional state, or some other story information, is labeled on each side.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2608/3777114873_87569f2561_m.jpg"/><br/><br/>When you have four players, different emotional states face each other so you can tell a story about each character interacting with each other while expressing those emotions.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2604/3777114901_2529be2f9f_m.jpg"/><br/><br/>When a story has been told for each pairing, you can rotate the card once in either direction of your choosing, thereby creating new types of interaction.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3572/3777918212_c9aed27445_m.jpg"/><br/><br/>You can keep turning your card until each side has been "touched" by the players to your left and right. After that, the story ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9979/what-do-i-say-when-random-people-ask-what-we-are-doing" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9979/what-do-i-say-when-random-people-ask-what-we-are-doing" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9979/what-do-i-say-when-random-people-ask-what-we-are-doing/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9979%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9979%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
