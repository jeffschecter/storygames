The idea behind putting the player stuff upfront (even if most game designers may be unaware of this) is that this is meant to give the GM an overview of the whole system she would have to understand and get the hang on, like a sorta test: "if you get past this section, now you understand the system enough to GM it". The second purpose behind this is that players only read the first part of the book and don't reach the GM only parts. Not that this is guaranteed to work but most of the time it does the trick.<br/><br/>In some japanese RPGs I've seen, there's actually a bunch of imortant GM related stuff upfront, like "The Golden Rule" in Double Cross, which is a list of things the GM should and shouldn't do with the game to keep the social contract from breaking. In Tenra Bansho there's the list of things that make you "win the game" as a GM or as a Player, and all these lists are about being a good team player, have fun and help everyone have fun. They actually state at the end: "If you did this things during the sesion, you can say you have mastered GMing/playing TBZ" If any GM related stuff should be put before than anything, is things like that. Also, the game principles, the philosophy behind it (How lethal is the game, how versatile are the characters, how much prep would I have to do, how to do it, what's the fun part of the game and how is all this related)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434461/#Comment_434461" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T09:36:34+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  9:36AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've written some of my own games this way, because it made sense for that game.

Often the things they think should be kept to DMs are really player needs, and vice versa. While I generally disliked 4th Edition D&amp;D this is one thing I think they achieved success with - the DM Guide was FINALLY a proper DM Guide.

I saw it as a practical place to start describing the game, because while yes, it's (a) right up front for players, it's also (b) a very important chunk of the system that the GM is gonna have to become familiar with.  Every other subsystem in the book will impact on these characters somehow, will jiggle these little numbers up and down...  So it makes sense to show the GM right away: "Here are the little numbers we will be jiggling".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434513/#Comment_434513" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T09:08:39+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  9:08AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in why the OP asks that question.

There are 5-7 players for every GM and it just seems more efficient to make the player section easier to reference. Up front is easier to reference.<br/><br/>If players don't need to reference the rules much, maybe start with a GM section first. How to pitch your game to players. How to help players make characters without using the text. It /is/ interesting that texts get written as player tools first, then GM tools second (and look at old D&amp;D books that attempt to split the rules into separate texts, to varying degrees of success).<br/><br/>I've seen texts that start with setting and then get into characters. That's not a bad way to go, either. Everyone cares about the setting. Some books start with system (pure system devoid of character or setting, like polyhedral dice or what is an RPG or required materials). It's usually only a couple pages, so maybe you forget it's there. Lots and lots of traditional game texts start with that. <br/><br/>You will also see differences in rules written as teaching texts vs. rules written as reference texts. A teaching text will take you step by step through the process of playing the game. Maybe that teaching-style game wants you to choose roles (GM, player), choose a setting, make characters, create a situation, then play from there. If so, the rules are going to mix GM and player stuff throughout the text. Most games are written as reference texts, though, so they're organized in a way that makes it easy to find the section you need. The "player section" is really the /character/ reference section. It gets used a lot in play, so put it up front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434610/#Comment_434610" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T10:29:24+00:00" title="June 30, 2014 10:29AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great point about texts trying to teach a procedure versus those trying to teach (say) a vivid setting.
