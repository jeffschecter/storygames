Jamie Fristrom ran this, and dang, that guy has this quiet sharpness. I played Amanda, a newly-turned vampire who was into breaching the lines of consent and gaining power from discomfort. She didn't understand what it meant to be a vampire, just that lately she wanted to open people up and drink from them. This was my first time playing a vampire, and I explored some ideas and behaviors that terrify me. Someone played a witch who started out playing private detective and ended up playing megalomaniac judge. Someone played an angel who fell into a complicated and not-entirely-safe submissive relationship with the witch.<br/><br/>This was easily the second-most-squeamish I've ever felt playing Monsterhearts, which makes it the third-most-squeamish I've ever felt playing a roleplaying game. Not themes I'd visit so thoroughly with most, but glad I could do so last night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399665/#Comment_399665" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T07:24:34+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  7:24AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did Fiasco with an internet group from this here forums.

Governor Hamlin Fraham aka Gov Bacon cowers in his office, escaping the reality of his doomed colony thanks to the psychotropic nibbles of the colony's chief medic Doctor Bedlam. Judge Advocate Judia Saux tries to prop up her fallen leader without overstepping her bounds. Meanwhile, her estranged father Cornall Saux is the victorious Dimber Damber of Mint Hill, with plans to lead the convicts out into the explosive landscape around them.

The GM liked this enough to rule that, every now and then, the origami figures moved. Apparently they were strong enough to help my co-worker with his bargain basement Iron Man suit lift lots of people in heavy chains. Well, I suppose, to be fair, these were the ones made from napkins on a cruise ship, so they may have been made of cloth.<br/><br/>Saturday, I played a nicely non-railroady Call of Cthulhu game. I mean, sure, the... well, I guess you can call it the villain, but that's kind of a matter of perspective, really. The villain was on a time table, but we could pretty much do whatever we wanted about that. The GM was actually surprised that the group didn't start drinking heavily early on or doing a lot more occult research. But the chemistry between the characters was a lot of fun, and I loved the pantomime of two of the players when one of them had utterly blown a Sneak roll. Definitely a game where failure was often as much fun as success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400690/#Comment_400690" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T12:27:14+00:00" title="December 13, 2012 12:27PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Dungeon World]<br/><br/>Our merry band of murderers arrives in a small oasis town in the middle of the desert.

Friend GMing the game.<br/><br/>I'm Vic "Lightning" Becker, Iron Hand (martial artist) in the style of the pointman from the game FEAR -- mega reflexes, but still competent with firearms.  Packing an MP5, a couple pistols, and my fists of steel.  Allies are a Tactical Commander and a 1337 H4x0r, with assault and battle rifles respectively.<br/><br/>We skydive in after our C-130 gets EMP'd and shot down, and engage a squad of thirteen Taliban troops packing rifles and pulwars, and win handily -- commander with her battle rifle, me throwing a charger sword-first into another charger -- after a Chinese war-mech comes out of the sand and our H4x0r takes control.  (The GM let her do it in one roll -- I'm going to have to explain more about the scope of rolls and multi-step tasks, as one turn is only supposed to last about 3 seconds!)  We rescue the rest of the team and get half a dozen more vehicles on our side.  We use the mechs to assault an Iranian missile base (which was overrun by Taliban), taking out a good dozen more mechs; our h4x0r by shooting them down in her own mech, me by jumping onto them and ripping the pilots out through the cockpits, and the rest of our SEAL team with AT4s.  The commander uses her abilities to pass her specialization in Demolitions onto the SEALS so they can take down the mechs.  Meanwhile, I kick in a window to evade a mass of gunfire (blowing all of my Badass Points to do so without getting gutted) and end up on my own in a silo, surrounded by a dozen Taliban.<br/><br/>I gun down four of them with my MP5, throw a few more out the window, smash a couple heads together, disarm a stealth specialist.  I survive mainly because my commander is on the line giving me encouragement -- she's spending Badass Points on me (another Commander ability) and throwing her Dodge specialization my way.  The h4x0r pulls up building schematics and isolates the position of the nuke we're supposed to disarm.<br/><br/>We do a pincer attack in a pair of elevators with our SEAL buddies along for the ride; half a dozen guys, including two automatic riflemen.  The riflemen lay down suppressive fire as I flashbang and disarm an enemy gunner, and then pounce on the opposing commander.  My Effortless Pin skill allows me to essentially stand on his throat as I hose down a few more enemies, while the commander engages soldiers and our h4x0r keeps the enemy infotech from disrupting our equipment (and the elevators!), as well as closing the missile silo's doors so that the nuke can't escape the base.  (If it blows, we all die, but at least it doesn't make it to its target.)  Eventually we finish off our opposition, and the commander (with seven seconds to go!) cuts the green wire and keeps the nuke from launching.<br/><br/>Total victory, no casualties, and SEAL Team 6 owes us a round.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401553/#Comment_401553" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-22T17:41:55+00:00" title="December 22, 2012  5:41PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Quiet Year, first time playing.

By the end of this session, Peter had gotten a girl with an eating disorder to promise him sex and when she went back on this he left her quite a mess in the forest. McKenzie was pushed by school bullies and her unrequited love for Lucien and unleashed her Darkest Self. Lucien fully gave over to the Demon whom he had a pact with, beat up a teacher and was jailed, raped his own mother and ended up in an epic battle with McKenzie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402009/#Comment_402009" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T22:22:53+00:00" title="December 28, 2012 10:22PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[The Quiet Year] <br/>My brother and I ate some medicinal brownies</blockquote>\nThis should be part of the official game prep.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402211/#Comment_402211" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T20:58:26+00:00" title="December 30, 2012  8:58PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played <a href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">@Zachary_Wolf</a> 's <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17759/world-of-dungeons-hack-streets-of-mos-eisley-playset#Item_47" rel="nofollow">Star Worlds</a> World of Dungeons hack.<br/><br/>Given our tastes in sci-fi, our game was more like two parts <i>Firefly </i>to one part <i>Star Wars</i>.  We set the game after the rise of the Empire before the construction of the first Death Star.<br/><br/>Our antiheroes in this tale are Xero Hu, a drop out from the Jedi academy who still has some control over the force and Dorne Silas, a disillusioned ex-soldier for the rebellion.  Both were short on creds, especially Dorne who has an unhealthy fondness for tech that hurts.  They met up with Gella Kain, a flamboyant fixer who holds private rooms in Chalmun\u2019s Spaceport Cantina.  She had been asked to broker a job for one of the Upper Class families of Tatooine.  An Imperial revue led by General Bernon Ti Rhea was coming planetside and the C\xe1vi family wanted to curry favor by greeting them with an extravagant skyfire show.  The other family wanted this display to reflect poorly on the C\xe1vis. The C\xe1vis run a vanity moisture farm in the wastes.  Instead of selling the water like the mom and pop or corporate farms do, the C\xe1vis use it to grow an incredibly showy garden.  They call their plantation the Oasis. Sabotage one of the idle rich\u2019s shows of vanity?  For 750 credits each, why not?<br/><br/>Our antiheroes hit the Mo\u2019Moolee Rah Market to look for something that would help them get an in with the C\xe1vis.  They found it in spades; the seeds of the rare D'Artagnan tree.  This would be the perfect pretense for getting into the Oasis. After a bit of a\u2026 uh\u2026 run in with some of the stall keepers, Xeno persuaded the owner of the seeds to sell them below cost with the premise that if the C\xe1vis like the plants they will buy the rest of the stock at twice the price.  A quick change of clothes, a little hot-wiring of a land speeder and the duo were on their way.<br/><br/>Gaina C\xe1vi was so enthused at the prospect of growing the trees in time for his celebration that he let several details of it slip; certainly enough to give Xero and Dorne the ammunition they need.  Turns out that the skyfire was going to be created by Avix D\xe1vila and her family.  Again posing as people far above their class, the pair were able to bluff their way into Avix\u2019s good graces and convince her they wanted to put on a skyfire show superior to that of their friendly rival Gaina C\xe1vi.  She agreed to give them a tour of the workshop, during which they plan to commit their sabotage.  That\u2019s, unfortunately, where we had to break for the night.<br/><br/>- - - <br/><br/>Some of my favorite bits of this were the details we invented, like Karin \u2013 a 100 proof liquor distilled from the larva of desert slugs.  The really nasty stuff has a living larva in it; at least until it drowns in the alcohol.  You\u2019re supposed to drink it before then.  Xero drank his and slowly sucked the larva through his teeth, thoroughly impressing Gella Kain.   I also really enjoyed the centerpiece of Gella\u2019s private room.  She had a large, clear glass vase full of something like the aurora borealis, except it also emitted heat.  When Dorne accidentally brought up a sore subject, the light in the vase became a single pinpoint and the room became noticeably colder.  That kind of stuff makes the game for me.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402228/#Comment_402228" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T22:02:23+00:00" title="December 30, 2012 10:02PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtesting World of Dungeon Crawls, a 0-level DCC-style hack of World of Dungeons.<br/><br/>Five players; fifteen "brave" but incompetent proto-adventurers. Sages, cutpurses, armorers...the like. Descending down a well inside of a ruined tower to rescue one of their young nephews from an uncertain fate. On a snowy evening. With werewolves about in the trees.<br/><br/>The group immediately splits up with five of them going down into the caverns and leaving the other ten out in the cold. The five run into six brigands guarding a large cavern lit by a cooking fire with a spit-roasting giant crab over it. There is a steep drop off into the cavern with a thin set of rough-hewn stairs leading down on one side. Several PCs throw caltrops down towards the brigands, but someone muffs their roll and the baker trips and falls down the stairs as caltrops go flying everywhere.<br/><br/>His partner following him sees two brigands running at the baker with spears at the ready. He exclaims "I will roll down the stairs and crash into them!" Fails his roll as well and ends up tumbling over 1d6 caltrops, each doing 1 pt of damage. Two PCs down, 13 to go.<br/><br/>"Well at least that's six caltrops we won't have to worry about finding now."<br/><br/>There were many more ignomious deaths like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
