So I wrote up a town and would invite comments or ideas to increase the juiciness of it:<br/><br/><b>COLBY</b><br/>Ten years ago the Adams family came west, Faithful from back east.  The family patriarch was driven by a vision of settling far to the south, in a secret valley shielded by the desert.  They didn't find it, but they did find Mountain People on the war path, driven to violence by the treaty incursions of the Territorial Authority.  The entire family was massacred except Lorenzo, who was left for dead, and Olive, who was taken captive at age thirteen.  She lived as a slave among the southern Mountain People for five years.  During her captivity her face was tattooed - five vertical bands on her chin in deep blue cactus ink.  When finally recovered, Olive was re-united with Lorenzo, who had become Steward of Colby and taken a bride in the interim.<br/><br/><b>SOMETHING'S WRONG</b><br/>Sister Olive, a former captive of the Mountain People, is quietly teaching converts to hate themselves and their kin.  Suspicion and bigotry are on the rise.<br/><br/><b>PRIDE</b><br/>Brother John L. refuses to marry Sister Olive, despite pressure from her brother, the Steward.  John L. is repulsed by her appearance and by her past - he has a fairly good idea what her captors must have done to her, and he doesn't want "damaged goods", even the sister of a Steward.  Besides, he's in love with Unity.<br/><br/>Lorenzo is using his position as Steward as power - to force John L. to marry his sister - rather than responsibility.<br/><br/>Olive and Lorenzo insist that John L. love Olive or, failing that, that he marry her anyway to better her lot in life.  <br/><br/><b>INJUSTICE</b><br/>Olive can't really fend for herself in Colby - she has to rely on her brother to put food on the table. She wants to be a wife and mother but can't, because no eligible man will have her.<br/><br/>John L. and Unity can't be together, even though they are in love.<br/><br/><b>SINS</b><br/>Violence, soon - John L. is going to go up the mountain and kill the Mountain People's "medicine witch".  <br/><br/>Apostasy - Olive's cult has veered a little wide of the Faith's mark concerning love and compassion.  Because her religion classes are not taught in English, no one in Colby knows what she's up to.<br/><br/>Disunity - Olive is glad that Unity is going to die.  <br/><br/><b>DEMONIC ATTACKS</b><br/>Sister Unity is suffering from a mysterious illness and will soon die.  John L. thinks it's Mountain People witchery to punish her for converting, and nobody really disagrees.  <br/><br/>Over time, the Mountain People - including converts - are going to suffer, and those who cause the suffering are going to prosper.<br/><br/><b>FALSE DOCTRINE</b><br/>MOUNTAIN PEOPLE ARE THE ENEMY OF THE KING OF LIFE.<br/><br/><b>CORRUPT WORSHIP</b><br/>Olive preaches the converts hatred and self-loathing in their own tongue during "special services", and no one knows but the cultists themselves.  <br/><br/><b>FALSE PRIESTHOOD</b><br/>Olive leads the tiny cult and is perfectly happy to see one of her own cultists whither and die, all in accordance with the King of Life's plan for the Mountain People.<br/><br/><b>SORCERY</b><br/>There's power in hate.  It spreads like a weed.  It's infecting others, like John L., who is hot to go "teach the savages a lesson" for bewitching Unity.  <br/><br/><b>HATE AND MURDER</b><br/>Hatred as thick as clay, built up over torturous years, murder soon to follow.  John L. is ready to go up in the hills the day the Dogs arrive.  <br/><br/>(Continued)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109480/#Comment_109480" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T13:19:26+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  1:19PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>WHAT DO THE TOWNSPEOPLE WANT FROM THE DOGS?</b><br/>Olive wants her "shameful marks" removed.<br/><br/>Lorenzo wants the Dogs to marry Olive to John L.

It is a bad match - she's far from worthy of his affection and they can't even communicate.

Other than that, it seems pretty solid.  <br/><br/>(I also like Dog towns to involve sexual misconduct, but I'm not sure you need it here.)<br/><br/>I'm curious about why you chose to have some of the named townspeople not speak English -- are you thinking of having some business with an unreliable interpreter, or is it just for versimilitude.<br/><br/>I can't help thinking of my first Dogs character, who was a halfblood and never really knew his Mountain People father.

Perhaps the dogs run across the aftermath of such a decision made by one of the profits and ancients (I think it would be important for the decision to be made by somebody higher up the food chain than the dogs).  Now the dogs must choose whether the previous edict is doctrine or is not valid because it was made without adequate knowledge of the situation.

You asked for what jumped out at me, so here goes. Ignore at will.<br/><br/>One of my thoughts is that Lorenzo wants John L. to marry Olive to better her lot in life, but Olive wants John L. to marry her to stop him from diluting the blood of the faithful. She's too pissed to feel sorry for herself right now.<br/><br/>You could easily turn John L.'s anger at the Mountain Folk into anger at and suspicion of Pete Stars and his heathen ways. He knows Pete loves Unity. He knows Pete is burning with hatred and jealousy. That heats things up to awful pretty quick.<br/><br/>I want to know more about this Pete Stars who thinks the Dogs will turn him into a white man. What's he willing to do to get what he wants? What's he willing to do to stop John L. from getting Unity? Does he think Unity would love him if he were white?<br/><br/>I want more from Faith and/or Unity too. Not sure what. Unity wanting to die seems to tame. I want her to be a mountain woman who spoke out in opposition to Olive and her cult of hatred, only no one believed her. Unity speaks good English. John L. loves her not Olive. I think that tension could be built up. If she wasn't so sick, Olive wouldn't be able to have her way. <br/><br/>Any of those thoughts useable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109522/#Comment_109522" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T00:25:03+00:00" title="November 25, 2007 12:25AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>Perhaps the dogs run across the aftermath of such a decision made by one of the profits and ancients (I think it would be important for the decision to be made by somebody higher up the food chain than the dogs).</blockquote>\nOooh, neat. I like the idea of Dogs in conflict with a decision made by one of the prophets and ancients. And make that decision just patently wrong headed so the Dogs can't in good conscience agree with it.

I'd made her sympathetic in the initial scene where they met and I guess they took that to heart.  John L. got talked out of going up the mountain to kill some folks and eventually was made the new Steward and got to marry his sweetheart.<br/><br/>Earlier in the game they were convinced he should marry Olive, and had a conflict where they talked him into it.  "You're a rich man, John L., you can maybe have two wives."  And I was just licking my chops.  *Everybody* tried to get them to solemnize that marriage immediately, but they were too cautious.<br/><br/>( I added this town as<a href="http://meekmok.com/sassy/dogs/resources.html" rel="nofollow"> January Branch</a> to my collection.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109667/#Comment_109667" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T11:44:23+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 11:44AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do the Dogs converse with the townsfolk that can't speak English?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109670/#Comment_109670" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T11:50:58+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 11:50AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>How do the Dogs converse with the townsfolk that can't speak English?</blockquote>\nWith Olive translating, which was really fun.  At one point the Dogs sanctimoniously refused Faith's request for a divorce, and Olive made a sarcastic crack in the Mountain people language, and they both laughed.  It was interesting to see them depend on someone they didn't really trust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109710/#Comment_109710" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T16:07:48+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  4:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thought that occurred to me over the weekend: I've noticed that my Dogs towns often get much better when I go back through and make sure that the female NPC's have just as much agency and stuff to do as the males.  This has become one of my pre-flight checks when running this game, actually.  Either the cowboy setting or my own unconscious sexism leads me to letting the female townsfolk off easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
