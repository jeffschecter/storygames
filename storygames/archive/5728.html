I'm unsure of how I like that, but it seems to work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint&amp;Sinner</cite>Maybe have them spend Hope to work at odds.<br/><br/>Is this too pricey?</blockquote>\n"Spend" is the wrong word, I think.  "Lose."  (For one, you can't spend what you don't have, and I wouldn't want to say "you can't fight because there's no Hope in your cup.")<br/><br/>That, and "lose" is negative language which, I think, would reinforce the right vibe.  But, given that there might not be Hope to lose, I might look at the flip side -- Despair is gained.  Special coins of Despair that don't turn into Coins of hope.  For every person involved, one of these coins is added.<br/><br/>Unlike Joe's idea, this colors PVP as an extremely negative thing, and, I think, maybe dangerous if playing in a group where one person wants to push PVP action (which I've seen with some folks having mind control Madness Talents.)<br/><br/>Along with that: no spending of Hope to add to your successes -- that way, the playing field is level.  You could, if you still want to color PVP without making it potentially as devastating as what I say above, have it so that no one can spend Hope until some time after said PVP thing -- based on time, adventure, or making amends, something like that.  That way, the currency isn't altered, just the ability to spend it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128105/#Comment_128105" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T13:48:20+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  1:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, how would I do this?<br/><br/>Right now, my thoughts run like this:<br/><br/>- If they're going at it with each other, they're making their own Pain.  No need to get the GM in there, save that he could use the opportunity to spend some Despair to make the PvP fight go poorly.  So no Pain dice as a factor.<br/><br/>- Players must combine their Exhaustion and Madness pools to determine what dominates.  They do NOT combine their Discipline pools for this determination.  <br/><br/>So, let's say I have 3 Exhaustion, 3 Discipline and 2 madness.  My foe has 3 discipline, 2 exhaustion, 4 madness.  We're at odds, so we roll.<br/><br/>I get:<br/><br/><img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> 3 4 6<br/>E: 3 5 5 <br/>M: 4 6<br/><br/>I have three successes.<br/><br/>He gets:<br/><br/><img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> 6 2 1<br/>E: 3 6<br/>M: 2 2 5<br/><br/>He gets 5 successes.<br/><br/>My opponent beats me and gets whatever he's after.  BUT, each of us has to compare our separate Discipline pools to our combined Exhaustion and Madness pools to determine dominance. Those combined pools are:<br/><br/>M: 6 5 4 2 2<br/>E: 6 5 5 3 3<br/><br/>Exhaustion's the stronger of the two (6 5 5 instead of 6 5 4 )<br/><br/>I compare to my Discipline, 6-4-3, and see that 6-5-5 beats it, so Exhaustion dominated me (look at my original roll: if this was a standard conflict, Discipline would have dominated, modulo Pain).<br/><br/>He compares to his Discipline, 6-2-1, and also gets beat by Exhaustion (which in this case isn't different from what it would have been like for him individually, but that's of little import).<br/><br/>Interestingly, this maps pretty closely to how I would probably rewrite the player cooperation rules today: instead of allowing helpers to contribute their Discipline, I'd instead ask them to choose whether they're helping with Exhaustion or Madness.  (Alternately, I'd simply have each helper roll their full pool and deal with the consequences on their own, able to contribute half of their successes to the help-ee, I guess.  Regardless, I'm not satisfied with the Discipline-combining mode the text currently suggests, these days.)<br/><br/>Ultimately, the aesthetic of DRYH is that <i>you are your own worst enemy</i>.  Efforts to increase your success also push you further down its wicked "death spiral".<br/><br/>So when players collide or cooperate, that effect should be magnified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128345/#Comment_128345" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T00:45:10+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did lots of PVP in our DRYH game last weekend.

The GM could spend despair, but didn't roll. Of course, Pain couldn't dominate, but the fact that both PCs were taking fallout made it pretty effective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143961/#Comment_143961" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T10:32:07+00:00" title="May 14, 2008 10:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry to resurrect this but having gone back to a few more games (some with the Delta Green mods set in the Mad World) I'm still concerned about the  resolution phase. What if both players say "I unload a clip into you until you're dead, dead, dead" or something equally final.  With nightmares (and other squamous/Chthonic monsters) I've never had problems with an icky endgame. With player on player though, I'm not so comfortable. Do you limit the death/damage (ie. no describing killing blows or set up some social contract beforehand) or do you do something else?

Does one want something from the other? Is one stopping the other from doing something? Does one just want to harm or injure the other - will they settle for crippling? See if they are willing to accept these stakes and then move on from there, see if you can find something more interesting to the story then a fight to the death. If they are really set on killing the other after that, then roll the dice and have the loser make a new character. Just make sure everyone at the table is having fun, and that the fight to the death made the story better.<br/><br/>- C                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
