Nearly half the print run is gone already, either to people who preordered or retailers. It's deeply exciting.<br/><br/>The book itself is, I think, looking rather beautiful. (This is an old photograph, actually, but it shows the book really well).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/A%20Taste%20For%20Murder%20proof%20picture.JPG" width="450"/><br/><br/>So, it's now released. If you'd like to buy the book, you can <a href="http://games.indie-rpgs.com/unstore/game/78" rel="nofollow">get it from the Unstore</a> for $20, plus shipping and handling. There are still some jars of chutney too. Say if you'd like one.<br/><br/>If you'd like to buy the PDF, you can <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/81" rel="nofollow">get that from the Unstore</a>, too, for $10. You guys will get your chutney in electronic form: simply <a href="http://www.self-sufficient.co.uk/OtherImages/caramelised-red-onion-relish.jpg" rel="nofollow">download it</a>.<br/><br/>If, having read the PDF, you would like the book, you can <a href="http://games.indie-rpgs.com/unstore/game/82" rel="nofollow">upgrade to the print version</a>, for $10 plus shipping and handling. Put simply, you send me the difference between the PDF and print prices and I'll send you the book. (You should get the book. It is pretty. But I understand if you'd like to see the PDF before buying it.)<br/><br/>(I'm also thinking of an .epub version. Tell me if you want this.)<br/><br/>And there you go.<br/><br/>People who preordered: thank you very much for your support. I really appreciate it. The last book was posted on Saturday. If they haven't arrived by the end of next week or there's some kind of problem, get in touch. I put something extra into <i>almost every envelope</i> (and then I ran out, so apologies to the final few). Let me know when you get the books. It'll make me happy.<br/><br/>Thanks again and I hope you enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275958/#Comment_275958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T12:21:37+00:00" title="June 14, 2010 12:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bravo, Graham.

Or that is a rule that is in effect only for influence scenes? What if the investigation fail? He has to move an influence die?<br/><br/>5) The inspector roll the detective dice even in influence scenes?<br/><br/>6) Page 34, on a successful investigation, "the group fills in the first empty box". This means that the player, with the advice of the group, choose what to write, or that the other players tell him what his character was keeping secret? <br/><br/>7) Red Herring: if the red herring was not entertaining enough and the investigation succeeds, the investigated character has to make another confession in the same side scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277112/#Comment_277112" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T11:45:04+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 11:45AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2010 12:03PM by Graham.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1) Page 11.

If you've already had "the garden" as a location, you can still have "by the duck pond" or "on the lawn". If you've already had "the drawing room" as a location, you can still have "by the fireplace" or "in the bay window", even though those are part of the drawing room. If you've already had "the stables", you can still have "the hayloft" or "behind the stables".<br/><br/>Just set each scene somewhere new. It needn't be <i>very</i> new: an old location, used in a new way, will do fine. Perhaps you decide "the moonlight garden" is different from "the garden". That'll do me.<br/><br/>(Don't sweat blood over this. This rule just gives you some fresh scenery for each scene.)\n<blockquote>2) the Black Die Circle list "bloodletting" as something to "portray" in a scene. During the game we played this with people hitting each other or cutting themselves with knives or running into a rose bush, but how can someone "portray best" a bloodletting?</blockquote>\nIt's up to you. Personally, I'd give the die to whoever entertained me most with their bloodletting.<br/><br/>(I do agree that "portray" doesn't seem the right word, when used in relation to "bloodletting".)\n<blockquote>3) When people write the name of the character they want to die, they must answer that question as characters or as players (I mean: they should choose the character their character hates more, or the characters that they think would make for a better story?)</blockquote>\nCrucially, either. It's deliberately unspecified. You might vote for someone whom your character hates. You might vote for someone because their death would make a good story. Or you might vote tactically, because someone has lots of Influence Dice over you.<br/><br/>There's a deliberate blurring of characters and players, here. Vote in whichever way you want.\n<blockquote>4) Investigation: when someone win an investigation, he can take a die from the investigated character as if he had win a influence scene? Or that is a rule that is in effect only for influence scenes? What if the investigation fail? He has to move an influence die?</blockquote>\nNo, Investigations don't affect influence dice.\n<blockquote>5) The inspector roll the detective dice even in influence scenes?</blockquote>\nYes. Everyone always takes part in every roll.\n<blockquote>6) Page 34, on a successful investigation, "the group fills in the first empty box". This means that the player, with the advice of the group, choose what to write, or that the other players tell him what his character was keeping secret? </blockquote>\nIt's up to the group.<br/><br/>See the section "On Tennis". There are a few things, in A Taste For Murder, that are left to the group to resolve. Here, the rules tell you the group should decide, but they don't quite explain <i>how</i> to decide. It's deliberate. It depends on the dynamic of the individual group.<br/><br/>So perhaps you'll come to a consensus. Perhaps you'll allow the investigated player a veto. Perhaps the most enthusiastic player will sway everyone else. The decision will work differently in every group.\n<blockquote>7) Red Herring: if the red herring was not entertaining enough and the investigation succeeds, the investigated character has to make another confession in the same side scene?</blockquote>\nYes. Probably, the dialogue goes like this:<br/><br/><i>Investigated character: Blah blah blah Red Herring!<br/>Investigator: I don't believe that for a moment.<br/>Investigated character: Curses, you saw through me. OK, then. Blah blah blah Real Reason.</i><br/><br/>I hope that helps! I apologise for answering "It's up to you" so many times, but it really is, and it's deliberate.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
