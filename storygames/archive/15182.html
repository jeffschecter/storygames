Consider also that they are a mainstream form of LARP, specifically.  I've heard about many games where people take it as an opportunity to dress in vintage clothing, people are acting as their characters not just narrating for them.  Many also fit into a dinner party format, though tea time or a cocktail party could work just as easily.   I think the fact that they piggyback on an acceptable form of social gathering helps their mainstream appeal.  The real challenges will be finding other exciting things, besides a murder, that could happen in a fixed setting and/or finding ways to bridge from the LARP format into a story telling format.  Perhaps negotiations (I could see something like Burning Wheel's The Sword where players decide what to do with a novel object) or espionage (thinking about the find-your-partner mechanics in the board game Incognito).  Kagematsu might make for a compelling tea time scenario (nominally in the village tea house).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345059/#Comment_345059" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T12:55:35+00:00" title="October  6, 2011 12:55PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An important thing to consider about those types of games. They drive story through structure rather than through characterization.<br/><br/>In other words, your character is more "a person who has this resource (clue, etc)" rather than "a person who feels this way about these sorts of things".<br/><br/>In other other words, they are structured more or less as a board game. People have interactions that are driven by the formulaic structures of the set up, rather than by the feelings, emotions, etc. of their character.<br/><br/>Not that this is a condemnation, by any means. It's just an analysis.<br/><br/>I've been playing in a larp called Starship Valkyrie that does the same thing. The details of who your character is and their background and how they feel and all that is only as relevant as you want to make it. For the most part, your character is a selection of skills. The situation drives the drama. The ship is being attacked. Someone has been hurt. We need to get the doctor over here to treat them because they're the only one on the ship right now who has the skill to do that. But the doctor is busy with something else right now. And we're still being attacked. 2 consoles just got damaged, so we need to get the Engineers in here to fix them. And we need to launch the fighter ships to go out and help. But there's a few different targets, so we need to decide on a course of action quickly so we can get them launched and out there. And there's something weird happening and we need the Science folks to figure it out. And where's the Doctor, isn't she done yet? We have wounded here!<br/><br/>It's very situation driven. And my wife, who gets very shy about roleplaying and characterization, has no problem diving in and playing a Doctor. Cause she knows what she's supposed to do - she's supposed to react to the situation and fill her role on the ship. And any characterization stuff she feels like adding on top of that is just flavor - it's not the driving action of the game.<br/><br/>That sort of model makes things very easy for people who aren't comfortable with roleplaying to get involved, because the characterization, which they feel unsure about, is not the driving force.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345083/#Comment_345083" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T15:29:24+00:00" title="October  6, 2011  3:29PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2011 3:30PM by Graham.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>What are the similarities and differences?

I don't think that eliminates roleplaying from these games. What eliminates roleplaying is that player action cannot alter the direction of the story. It's closer to acting.<br/><br/>Though, it gives me an idea. I wonder what would happen if you played your character guilty as fuck. "Yeah I did it" would probably break the game for other players (especially since there's often a law enforcement character), but I wonder how close you can get to that and make it fun.\n<blockquote>However, they are proto-LARPs in that people like to costume and use silly accents and joke around about the scenario and speculate about the outcome and so on, so I can see someone who is interested in one getting interested in a roleplaying LARP too.</blockquote>\nThat might be the closest in game terms. Although I would never play a LARP, and I do play hosted mysteries. I think it's a good potential gateway into roleplay gaming in general.  <br/><br/>It's also something to think about for creating something that is intentionally a proto-LARP or proto-RPG. Like does Montsegur 1244 fit into the in-between space more than strictly being an RPG?<br/><br/>The biggest problem we have playing hosted mysteries is that once you play a scenario, you're done with it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gravity</cite>I think the threshold to get into our games (even Fiasco as a product) is way too high, and the awareness/marketing is minimal, but the _activity_ of story-gaming appeals a whole lot.</blockquote>\nPrecisely. If there's anything I've learned from making social and mobile games for two years is that the biggest barrier to entry is simplicity followed shortly by accessibility. Desire and interest in games is close to last place.<br/><br/>Edit: The difference between simplicity and accessibility is this. Simplicity is about the game rules (HERO vs Fiasco). Accessibility is about the game's creative direction or theme (being an orc warlock vs being a farmer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345717/#Comment_345717" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T15:58:47+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  3:58PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Though, it gives me an idea.
