I talked with my normal group and we decided that it would start this summer. Since then I've spent a lot of time pouring over the book, making sure that I understand mechanics and that I am comfortable with running the game the way that is described in the MC section. The problem I am having, after two sessions, is that my group does not seem to be embracing the style and flavor of the game. We talked about creating characters with real motivations and goals, and I'm finding (two sessions in) that their characters don't really seem to have much thought put into them (none of them have given me anything in the way of a back story that I could use), for instance the Hocus still has yet to give us any idea of what their cult's principles are (which is making it very hard to draw them into anything). As a result they are acting like a D&amp;D; group in a post apocalyptic setting. I'm not sure how to draw them into the game, any ideas or advice that anyone could offer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329781/#Comment_329781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T18:46:17+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  6:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 6:46PM by Ross_Cowman.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi T-rex,<br/>I can help, but I need to know more about how you are MCing.

It should still be fun. So they kill some badguys, get some barter, buy some gear. That's your opportunity to make the badguy's friends mad, or destabilize the region now that the badguys are gone, to have the merchants they barter with become the npc in the pc-npc-pc triangles, and to activate the gear's downsides.<br/><br/>You say "very difficult to draw them into anything" ... with AW, you shouldn't have to. You have your cult front or whatever. The pc's don't care. So you tick down the countdown clock on its threats. The threats happen. Cultists attack, convert your Hocus's followers, whatever.<br/><br/>Are you making your beginning-of-session rolls? The hocus's followers &amp; fortunes roll will often create gameplay for you - they're in want. How does that interact with the threats on the home front?<br/><br/>Highlight weird or their worst stat. Then they'll want to open their brains and fail rolls to get the xp. And that's your opportunity to make moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329784/#Comment_329784" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T18:59:42+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  6:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 7:04PM by Brennen Reece.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe your group should try Dungeon World.

But the responses I got were really generic in a lot of ways, for example our Gunlugger's response to "How did you become a gunlugger/who taught you to shoot?" was something along the lines of "my father taught me to shoot, but he died when I was a little kid." And the Hocus's response to my questions about her cult (I tried a few different leading questions) came back almost universally with responses of "I'm not sure, I haven't really thought about it much." And as the Emperor said I thought it was a strange choice, especially as she has been trying to use her moves (specifically Augury) in ways that I thought were more consistent with what a Brainer would have done. An example of that is during a chase she used <i>isolate or protect something from the psychic maelstrom</i> to try and disrupt someone's concentration while they were driving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329807/#Comment_329807" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T20:53:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  8:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See if she wants to switch to the Brainer.

Especially as one of the few building blocks that our Hocus gave me was that she really was not one to see individuals. This kind of works along with the one of the negative aspects of her cult is that they sort of own her instead of the other way around. It could possibly work to draw her in, using her own people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Gunlugger should prove easy enough to pull into things though. He is obsessed with weapons and in the first session he got into an altercation with one of the holding's guards which ended with him killing the guard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other character that has been proving a difficulty is the Battlebabe. The player is one of those that GM's and MC's loathe. A distracted gamer who does other things at the same time as she games. The issue with her is that she decided that she wanted to be a battlebabe, and doesn't really want to trade on her looks. This is not really an issue until we find out that she also doesn't want to use the badass shotgun that she has. And while I want to get her invested in the fiction, I don't want to seem like I am picking on her by having NPCs constantly forcing her hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it is seeming, as I think about things more, is that with the PCs not taking authorship of certain things (like their relationships with people in the holding) I may just have to take it into my own hands to a degree, if only to get them started, and see what happens from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329821/#Comment_329821" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T23:19:24+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 11:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the battlebabe, I found when I played one that it took a little while for me to work out what my motivations were. in fact, the description you have there could have described by first three sessions pretty well.

The player gets to decide who that character is. You get to be a fan of that character and see what they do. <br/>I don't assume your Battlebabe is a killer, or your Gunlugger loves guns, or I know how any playbook "is" just cause I played or MC'd one before. <br/><br/>Theres this other thing, I'm having a hard time putting it into words, but maybe y'all can help me here. I'm building off of John Harper's definition of <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2011/05/apocalypse-world-guide-to-hard-moves.html#comments" rel="nofollow">Soft Moves and Hard Moves</a><br/>In the first session you spend lots of time asking establishing questions, you might say something like,<br/><br/>"So Always, where do you live?"  or <br/>"So Kray, you said you wear athletic gear? Where you scrounge that?<br/>I like to think of these as soft moves, you're setting something up but you are letting the PCs put the pieces together. Even something like,<br/>"So Grandma, how do you feel about the Bonerats?" is still really this same kind of soft move. The point is I haven't decided what the Bonerats are. It could be some gang, it could be some wierd thing that inhabits the malestrom, hell maybe Grandma's body guard is reffered to as The Bonerats.<br/><br/>compare that to<br/>"So Always, how long have you been in the slave trade?" or<br/>"So Kray, who did you kill to get that jumpsuit?"<br/>"So Grandma, how long has it been since the Bonerats carried off Dremmer?"<br/><br/><br/>these are all hard moves. They establish things in the fiction that are irrevocable. <br/><br/>My point here being, know when you're making hard moves and use them with care. You should use hard moves when someone hands you an opportunity like a missed roll, or when if follows logically from the fiction.<br/>If you open up 1st session making hard moves off the bat, you'll never find out what their Apocalypse World looks like.  <br/><br/>does that make sense? any thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329968/#Comment_329968" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T12:13:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 12:13PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to engrave Johnstone's post on a bronze plaque and hang it over the game table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329981/#Comment_329981" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T12:38:16+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 12:38PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans, Ross, Johnstone... great answers!

Where does the gunlugger get the ammunition for his big gun?  What kind of house does the hocus live in?   Who is the battlebabe's best friend? <br/><br/>I'd also be inclined, with a group like that, to point out that the rules don't really allow the MC to take charge.  They encourage a reactive style: the MC makes things happen in response to player moves.

A couple months back I said, "You know, it's kind of rude to bring another form of entertainment to a roleplaying game and spend most of the session distracted."  And she looked at me and said, "We're not going to have this discussion."  And I said, "Okay, we aren't."  I haven't run a game since; in mid-August she's moving to Lebanon, so I'm just being all conflict-avoidant until then.<br><br>But it sounds like your players aren't invested in the game at all.  Your gunlugger doesn't seem to realize that the point of the game is relationships with other characters.  Your fundamental problem seems to be not that they don't know what to do in AW, but that the things they need to do to make AW fun are not things they want to do.  These are out of game problems - forcing them to do the things that make AW fun is not going to make anyone happy if it's not the kind of game they want to play.  So it's probably time to sit them down and say, "Look, this game is about *social interactions* between the characters.  If you don't want to interact with other characters to the point that you make invulnerable indestructible loners or you distract yourself with laptops and Facebook, we're probably better off playing Munchkin."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330144/#Comment_330144" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T22:59:51+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 10:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ouch, I always ask folks to turn off their cell phones before games.

My entire group consists of college students and some of my players are taking classes over the summer (insane IMO because they condense 16 weeks of information into 4.) and they tend to be plunking away at papers. Like Chirstopher said, the Gunlugger is not really a problem. He does tend to build characters who are "lone wolves" but allows them to be drawn into things if it is interesting, and having the holder start denying access to resources is just the sort of thing to get him drawn in. I actually have gotten a decent amount of cool interaction out of him. Also he seems to have it stuck in his mind that since he has sweet guns, that any problem he runs into can be solved with a bullet. I plan to have those two things, at least, make his life difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it looks like there is going to be a couple weeks of downtime due to travel plans everyone has coming up, so I will probably sit down with everyone at a time when I can get them together for a few minutes and reiterate some of the things which they seem not to understand. A podcast I listen to ( The Jank Cast) had an episode on what it means to be a GM and on of the casters brought up the point that they had to tell their AW group a couple of times in the first few sessions that the rules done really give the MC a way to make things happen if the characters don't take matters into their own hands and make moves. All I can do if they refuse to make moves is start stacking up timers and let them tick away until the characters will be forced to do something as the world goes up in flames.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_330149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330149/#Comment_330149" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T00:21:19+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 12:21AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>... so they can figure out who their characters are through actions, rather than thinking about their pasts.</blockquote>Good advice!

The problem I am having is not that they cannot engage when things get rolling, they are more than capable of reacting to things which are happening around them. What I am seeing though, began with the first session. They came to the table without having put thought into what kinds of characters they wanted to play or what they might do with them. So when I remind them that the second half is essentially me following them around for a day, they looked at me blankly. I've talked with them about the fact that I am not coming to the table with a preplanned campaign. However, as soon as the curtains opened and the spotlight switched on they got stage-fright. I ended up spending a good portion of the session listening to "I don't know" "How should I know?" and "Isn't that something the GM comes up with?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me like I am having to railroad in order to have anything at all happen. A perfect example of this comes from the Hocus in the group. As I said before, there is (as of yet) no real description or delineation of the cult's beliefs. So I injected a situation, one of her followers (a pro scrouger called Grome) comes stumbling into the Mongolian BBQ that the cult lives in, having the shit thoroughly kicked out of him. He relays that Tum Tum, the only child among the followers, was forcefully taken from him by holders who said that the cult was going to get the kid killed (giving insight that the cult has been doing crazy/stupid things).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hocus shrugged and asked what he expected her to do. It took Grome pulling her bodily from the cult's abode to get her to even attempt to look for the kid. Though as soon as she agreed to try and find Tum Tum, the player looked at me and asked how the hell she was supposed to find the kid. I'm not sure if this is a problem of players not knowing how to/feeling comfortable with coming up with things on the fly. Or it there is something that I am missing which would allow me to make things fun for them, while not breaking the spirit of the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330162/#Comment_330162" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T05:17:59+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  5:17AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like you need to playa  different game.

When I first introduced this type of play to my group they fluctuated between taking over the game (awesome!) and kinda lounging around not knowing what to do (kinda slow). <br><br>If your players aren't sure what to do, try to give them a little bit of both styles of running the game (a little trad a little indie for lack of better terms). Create some specific scenes and threats and "talk" during the MC part of the conversation that are a little more guided. Sometimes players need conflict to discover who their characters are, there's nothing wrong with a little action at the beginning of the game (direct action, like a challenge, or a fight). When you engage your players, make sure its something their character is interested in (look at their relationships, their style, the playbook they chose). Maybe re-establish those first session questions to be more pointed like people recommended above. I think it's <i>how</i> you ask the question that makes it work. Guided, specific questions help give good boundaries for creativity to blossom. Johnstone's questions are excellent, and the difference between soft moves and hard moves are good guides too.<br/><br/>The example you gave with the child asking for help... maybe the player just didn't think her character would want to save a child? That's intense, why would she feel that way? Maybe it felt too forced? Not doing something is a move too, when she doesn't go after the child you can always respond with consequences, maybe the player would enjoy that? You could just ask her OOC, hey, is this not something you're interested in? If not, why? An email in between sessions might get a clearer picture for you as to what she would like to do in the game, what sorts of trouble she sees her character getting in to. Do you have scenes where the PC's all sit around having breakfast? Or a hardhold meeting? Kinda intro scenes to get the In Character rollin? Those are great low pressure ways for players to get in character and for you to see what interests them and go from there. Play around with a couple different approaches and see what you get. I wouldn't give up yet!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330177/#Comment_330177" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T07:31:22+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  7:31AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Start a countdown clock, at midnight, the child shows up crying with a satchel strapped to her.

That's missing the entire point, I think.  This is APOCALYPSE World, not Badasses hanging out at the biker bar world.  The PCs motivations are simple...food, shelter, survival.  Fronts are things the GM invents for the purpose of threatening food, shelter, and survival.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don't need proactive players.  You need 1) establish where food shelter and survival comes from for each character.  2) create fronts that take those things away.  3) wait for the players to do something about it...or die of exposure and starvation.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnstone's questions above aren't about deep inner meaning.  They're about identifying the name of the person that the Gunlugger gets his food from, and what the Gunlugger has to do to earn his keep.  If the player doesn't want to participate in helping you flesh that out...fine...you flesh it out, tell him how it is.  Frame a scene where Doghead is telling him to go fuck up some people for him or else he'll cut off his meat ration, then sit back and see how the character reacts.  No matter what he does...that's the story...maybe he goes and fucks up those people, so now you have the reactions of their friends to throw back at him.  Maybe he tells Doghead to fuck off, so now he's starving...and here come some guy tied into one of your fronts who just happens to have some food to share.  Or maybe he goes after Doghead to get the food for himself...awesome...especially since that probably threatens a whole lot of people's status quo.  Doesn't matter.  Point is, its "do something or starve to death".  If he does nothing, you Hard Move his ass with some harm and move on to the next player.<br/>\n<br/>\nReactive players are gold in AW.  You don't need to figure out how to "hook" the player or pique the character's interest.  Hooks are easy...food, water, breathable air, the means to acquire and keep the same.  Dealing with people who want to share what you have, dealing with fuckers who want to take it from you.  Easy peasey stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAW mechanically works like this.<br/>\n1) GM establishes some threat that is going to fuck the character up<br/>\n2) GM gives player a chance to announce how they are going to respond to that threat (i.e. make a move).<br/>\n3) If the player shrugs and does nothing, GM proceeds to fuck the character up.<br/>\n<br/>\nRinse, repeat, continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice, there's no point in that cycle that says "GM waits for players to do something".  AW is not some hippie indie game.  There's absolutely no "system mandated PCs decide what they want to do" stuff.  AW is about as old school traditional as you can get.  Who gives a fuck what your PCs want.  Metaphorically speaking your job is to point a gun at their head and see what they do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe questions you ask your players have nothing...NOTHING...to do with what the players want.  Fuck that shit right in the ear.  The questions serve only to draw forth details.  "Who do you get your water from" is only important in so far as it puts a name and a character sketch to an NPC so you can now view them through cross hairs better.  They aren't flags or any of other collaborative stuff that goes on in other game.  Use the question to populate your world with characters...give THOSE characters an agenda...tie them into your fronts...figure out how your NPCs are going to act and react to stuff.  Then just make sure that all of that threatens to steamroller right over the PCs...and see what they do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's what I'm saying, this:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">We talked about creating characters with real motivations and goals</div>\n</blockquote>\nis wrong.<br/>\nThat's YOU playing the game wrong.  There's nothing in any of the play books that says "now create real motivations and goals"  You go around, you ask the Hx questions to establish some past history between the character.  You ask a few leading questions to populate the game world with NPCs you can reincorporate later...then YOU go create Fronts and YOU start the fuckery and YOU ask the players how they are reacting to your fuckery...and then you play from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously.  AW is not some touchy feely hippie indie game.  Its old school.  If your players are sitting around waiting for you to do something...that's because they're SUPPOSED to be sitting around waiting for you to do something...now go do it.  You don't need to draw them into anything.  Simply threaten to take away what they already have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher" title="Christopher"><img alt="Christopher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher">Christopher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330196/#Comment_330196" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T09:27:18+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  9:27AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the issue can be that some MCs feel all bad when they start to close doors on reactive players.<br/>\n<br/>\nVlad's advice is good, especially for early sessions.

Even though you can find the basic die mechanic on page 100 of the first edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Players Handbook, it's not exactly old school, with perhaps the most important difference being exactly those questions the MC is supposed to ask.<br><br>The core conceit of old school games is that the players (through their characters) explore an unfamiliar environment that is prepared by the referee/DM/GM. Who your character is or was before play doesn't really matter, because it has no connection to what you are exploring--only the stuff that happens to him/her during play (in the GM's environment) matters. In AW, the characters exist in an environment that is already (at least somewhat) familiar to them. It's easy to play a character in an unfamiliar environment: somebody else tells you what your character sees and then you explore. But how do you play a character in an environment they are familiar with? You've got three options:<br><br>1. You can become familiar with it during play. This is what inevitably happens--you explore some unfamiliar place and then it becomes familiar.<br><br>2. The GM can explain it to you, or you can read the setting book or whatever. Still not particularly ideal, especially if the GM can't explain it properly or doesn't read or remember the same parts of the setting bible as the players.<br><br>3. Or the third option, which is that the players can make it up. "Your character lives where, exactly? And what's it like there?" If this is ever suggested as an option in any old school game, or any game written in the 20th century even, I haven't seen it, and if this is a technique that was used in the early days of rpgs, I haven't heard of it (maybe there's something similar in Ars Magica, although that collective covenant creation stuff is pre-play). But this is what the questions in AW are for. These characters live in a world that is familiar to them because they live in it. They're not venturing into some unknown territory. So the players need a hand in sketching that environment out. Like Ralph says, it's not about motivations and goals and what players bring to the table <i>necessarily</i> (although it can be), but it IS about how those characters live. And then the MC threatens that life. Yes, the questions and answers stuff means the players take some of the weight off the MC, but it also means that since they're making that stuff up themselves, they're more than likely to be invested in it, so when you start to take it away, they'll want to fight for it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330223/#Comment_330223" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T11:01:26+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 11:01AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristansaurus-Rex</cite>Also he seems to have it stuck in his mind that since he has sweet guns, that any problem he runs into can be solved with a bullet.

Don't set up expectations for what you expect the players to do.  Present them with situations:  Grome comes in in a froth because Tum Tum has been kidnapped.  There's your situation.  What the players do with it is completely up to them.  If the hocus doesn't care?

Instead, what would have happened if you'd let her lack of interest stand?  Grome realizes that she's not leader material, and starts pulling people away from her cult.  Or Grome has a revelation: the Leader does not think children are important, which means that the end of the world is at hand.  <br><br>But fundamentally, if the players don't want to engage or participate, there's really nothing you can do to make them.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330270/#Comment_330270" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T14:09:30+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  2:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Charlton">@Charlton</a>...TOTALLY.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving Grome interpret the Hocus's disregard for the life of the child as being inspired revelation would be brilliant.  A session or two later (depending on how full the event queue was at the time) I'd totally start to work that into fabric of the cult / hold.<br/>\n<br/>\n"As you're walking through the hold you come across one of your followers preaching to a group of parents, encouraging them to abandon their children for they have no value.

Yeah, we used to have a guy here who could make shoes. But you shot him."<br>"Yeah, we used to have a guy who knew a safe route to that holding up in the hills, but you shot him."<br>"Yeah, we used to have somebody who could probably treat those wounds, but you shot her."</br></br></blockquote>\nAwesome.<br>Actually, you don't even need to make a list and cross off, right? Any time he needs something that'll just happen to be somebody he already shot.<br><br>I think it's actually pretty crucial to make a list and cross things off it and then only respond with that line when the PCs choose that particular thing at a later date. This is not a game where you manipulate the fiction to challenge the characters, this is a game where you are faithful to the fiction and the fiction inevitably ends up challenging the characters, because it is the fucking post-apocalypse. If the PC automatically shoots whoever they needed the most, no matter who they shoot or what it turns out they need later, that's not the result of a consistent fictional world, that's meta-narrative control, and it also looks a lot more like 'I am punishing you for shooting that guy' and a lot less like 'yep that guy you shot was a person who did stuff.'<br><br>I think Ralph pretty much nailed it in terms of the expectations on what MCs and PCs do, but for me the warning flag was not that the Hocus didn't want to save the kid -- it was that once the Hocus' player decided that, okay, she was going to save the kid... she had no idea how to do it, and looked at the MC expecting him to provide an answer. That's not about reactive players, that's about not understanding or not being willing to engage with the fiction or the system. It's pretty difficult to imagine that this player cannot think of a single method by which they might track this kid down, given how straightforward the situation was.<br><br>Then again this might just relate to the fact that they didn't want to save the kid in the first place, which reaction others have commented on at length. It's not surprising that a railroaded player will expect the MC to continue to lay the tracks for them -- if it was so important for YOU that her character go find this kid, then presumably YOU should have an idea how that was going to happen.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330282/#Comment_330282" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T14:53:01+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  2:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 2:54PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Valamir">@Valamir</a>: Ralph, you are preaching the good shit here. Great stuff!<br><br>I will share one tiny word of caution to the new MCs out there: It's your job to play the Threats of the world, to look for where the PCs are vulnerable, etc. as Ralph, Johnstone and others have said. But also to look at your NPCs through crosshairs and to be fans of the PCs! Don't lose sight of that.<br><br>I've seen a couple MCs go overboard with the "hit them where they're weak" instruction and turn the game into a series of horrible punishments.<br><br/>Ralph isn't advocating that! I just wanted to say it for the record. "Sometimes, give them exactly what they hoped for." Yes, even when they fuck it up and do the wrong thing. Sometimes even then.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Issues with my Apocalypse World group. - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14486/issues-with-my-apocalypse-world-group/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Issues with my Apocalypse World group. - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14486/issues-with-my-apocalypse-world-group/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Great caveat.

warlord) sending his badass assassin chick to my hardhold to put the screws to me.  Based on Seth's loving description, this was his super-cool, gonna-have-fun-with-this-one NPC...I think she may have even been a front or a key element to one.  Up from my office window I see her accosting my guards to get into our parking garage compound.  I take the long rifle down off my wall, hand it to one of my loyal gangers and say "take that bitch out" (or something similarly action hero-y).  It was 3/4 what my guy would do, and 1/4 a meta test of Seth as MC.<br/><br/>I could see Seth kind of working...but, but, but...and could almost watch him reading down his mental list of MC instructions.  A moment later he got to the one about crosshairs, and bang, just like that his beloved NPC (who'd had all of 5 seconds of screen time at that point) dead.<br/><br/>Which was all good, cuz the complication simply shifted from "how are we going to deal with Tum Tum's right hand assassin chick" to "how are we going to deal with the fall out from gacking Tum Tum's right hand assassin chick"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristansaurus-Rex" title="Tristansaurus-Rex"><img alt="Tristansaurus-Rex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristansaurus-Rex">Tristansaurus-Rex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330314/#Comment_330314" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T17:41:02+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  5:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, there is a lot of good advice here.

Why do I say that?  Because I've played a couple of games of AW now (as a player, not MC) and I noticed in our first game that one player didn't get it. He was always looking for the MC to guide him or set up a situation. He played the hardholder and every time he had to make a decision he would either ask 'What would (characters name) do' or he would send his gang to sort it. Slowly loosing his authority and, unlike the rest of us not getting any experience. He never really understood that he was his character.<br/><br/>Thing is - he needs the planned, guided structure of D&amp;D to interact with. I really want to run AW for our Thursday night group - but I know 3 of the long-term D&amp;Ders just won't get it. They need all those maps and miniatures and wargame tactics and shit to have a good game. That's what D&amp;D has done to them. <br/><br/>I don't think any of the incredibly really good advice given so far is going to help you get your players in to AW because it's not D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marqos" title="marqos"><img alt="marqos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/850/nXOPCJBZCOJ7Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marqos">marqos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384256/#Comment_384256" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T16:10:04+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  4:10PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to take a second to thank Evil Genius for necro-ing this thread.

They had been running the same campaign once a month for 7 years, and they had all gotten very dependent on riding the DMs rails. To point that, in game, when I realized we had stumbled upon a way to skip to the end of an entire adventure segment, the players rallied up and refused to follow through-- specifically citing that did not want to fuck with the DMs plans. I was totally floored.
