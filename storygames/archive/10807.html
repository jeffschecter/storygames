There were three of us (1 GM and 2 players), which seems a bit small for HotB, but next week we'll have 1-2 more.<br/><br/><b>Player Characters</b><br/><br/><i>Vlachette Fyx</i> (as in, \u201cmachete fikes\u201d). Vlachette\u2014meaning \u201cA Mirror's Cruelty\u201d\u2014is Blooded of the Serpent, with a weakness in the Virtue of Courage. As one might expect of a Serpent, he's got his share of sorcerous secrets. But he's not too secretive: he's fairly a flirt and a gossip, going after already-married people to get his Romance kicks.<br/><i><br/>Alexensis Deka</i> (as in, \u201cAlex-en-sis day-kah\u201d). Alexensis\u2014meaning \u201cKeeper of Secrets\u201d\u2014is Blooded of the Elk and keeps things far closer to the chest than our Serpent. His entire family is dead. By his own hand. He's a member of the forbidden revenge cult of Ikhalu, but as play begins he is disillusioned with the cult.<br/><br/>\tPlay begins with the two Barons (both a little older than typical starting characters\u2014what has held them to only a paltry barony?) opening the door to the coming-out-to-society party of the newly Blooded Lord Van Adrente, a young, sickly Wolf with sharp teeth. Literally. They had been sent to the party by their Count, ordered to get Van to sign a contract. They were greeted at the door by Van's Seneschal, a man tall as a mountain, thin as a twig, and very, very creepy. As soon as I defined that, the players asked for Wisdom risks, the result being that we found out Alexensis had been Van's personal guard during a period of shame/mourning over his family, and that the Seneschal owed Alexensis a favor.<br/>\tAs they entered the grand foyer of the party, the Lady of the house, Lara, comes sweeping down the steps, her husband in tow. As she stops in front of the dark marble fountain, A&amp;V approach her and the Lord and make a Wisdom risk to see what they already know about the pair. Turns out, the Marquise slept with Vlachette and her husband knows about it. The Lord's name is Carnasso (\u201cMy Flavor is Grape\u201d), and the reason he doesn't call for a duel with Vlachette right then and there is because he needs to continue to trade with the Fyx. In fact, Vlachette's family has provided the copious wine  that is flowing at the party right now.<br/>\tAt this point, The Lady announces the entrance of her son, and he appears at the top of the stairs, walking down and coughing. As he comes down, V&amp;C make Cunning risks to determine if they can suss out what his sickness is. They determine: It's hereditary and certainly fatal if left uncured. Alexensis walks over and yells to the crowd for a toast to the good Lord. They toast him and clap just genially enough before turning back to their circles and their drinks. He is the occasion for the party, but it is not his party. He knows this.<br/>\tAs Van is distracted, Vlachette slips a note in his pocket that says, \u201cDo not trust Alexensis.\u201d Alexensis begins speaking to Van of a cure for his ailment, and as they repair to a back room at Van's request, Alexensis determines (Wisdom risk) that he knows how to cure Van. They sit down in front of a fire, and as Alexensis desperately tries to convince Van that he's going to die if nothing is done, Van laughs him off, throws the note he's found in his pocket in Alexensis' face, and says, \u201cThis is a joke.\u201d<br/>\tMeanwhile, Vlachette is searching the crown (Cunning risk) for a drunk, any drunk. The player failed the roll, which meant I as GM determined he did find a drunk, and I got to say who (awesome!). It was a sloppily obese man ranting at some women while standing at the table and slurping down greasy chicken (this was my favorite NPC to play all night. Fantastic fun). Vlachette convinced him (I think without a risk\u2014my bad as GM) that Alexensis slept with his daughter, and pointed him in the right direction.<br/>\tJust as it sinks in to Van that he really does have a deadly illness (his old guard Alexensis wouldn't lie, would he?), and as he agrees (Cunning risk) to go to his room, and take what is given to him, the drunk obese man bursts in (Style point given by Vlachette's player to define this), challenging Alexensis to a duel. Van melts away to the back of the room, and as Obese man stalks off to the main foyer, Alexensis follows.<br/>\tIt should be known that Alexensis doesn't carry a sword. Which is strange, passing strange, for a Blooded ven. No matter: Vlachette gives Alexensis his sword. Alexensis calls the Seneschal over, and calls in his favor (turns out it's a favor in which the Seneschal owes his life to Alexensis\u2014some risk was involved here but I don't remember which) to have the S deliver a huge dose of the Ikhalu's Milk poison to Van. Alexensis prepares himself to face Obese man, who is standing in front of the fountain, wavering back and forth with a bottle of wine in one hand and a stick-thin rapier in the other. He yells and points his sword at Alexensis, but blubbers and falls down drunk as the Seneschal shrieks for the Lady of the House (Style point spent by the player to place that well-timed shriek). She rushes up, the party stops, and her wall-shaking sobs can be heard as Lord Carnasso flies down the stairs and throws the party out, grabbing Alexensis and having the Seneschal grab Vlachette. They are led upstairs, into a bare room with the Seneschal. Alexensis notes how loud the Lady's screams are, at which point Alexensis' player Compels Vlachette's Aspect Court Gossip (compel: talks about inappropriate things at inappropriate times), and Vlachette player has V say, brilliantly, \u201cShe's not screaming as loud as she did last night,\u201d at which point Carnasso enters and hears this (b/c of a Style point spent by A's player). He rages at Vlachette, but ends it simply with a \u201cNot. Now.\u201d He proceeds to question Alexensis, determines his innocence (at least that's what he says), and frees the pair to inspect the body.<br/>\tAs they enter the room they make a Cunning risk to see a hidden suicide note and Alexensis' little book of herbology &amp; poison that he apparently left with Van.<br/>\tThe Lady Lara enters, and Vlachette embraces her. She has him kiss his wrist and when he vows to have revenge on the one that did this to her son, she has a servant draw up and has V sign a contract in blood (not a Sorcerous Blood contract, which I meant to do but didn't know the rules off the top of my head\u2014a player called me on the fact that it wasn't really a Sorcerous Blood Contract) to complete his vow of revenge. She sits down next to Alexensis, finds his book, flips through it, and hands it back to him: \u201cBest not to just leave things lying about, hmm?\u201d she says, and leaves. The suicide isn't mentioned.<br/>\tAs A&amp;V finally leave the house, Carnasso stops them and gives the Seneschal to Alexensis as a gift to procure his silence on the matter of his son's death. Alexensis gladly accepts. Vlachette is ignored.<br/>----<br/>...and that ended it, pretty much, the only postscript being Alexensis' player saying he told one of his roadmen to \u201ctake care\u201d of the Seneschal, whom of course he does not trust. Does he get \u201ctaken care of?\u201d Hmm, we'll see.<br/>\tThe players also pretty much ignored seeking a contract for their Count. That'll probably come back to bite their asses. I have no clue why Alexensis killed Van, other than that he's a murder-hate machine. I want to see where that goes. I wish I had gotten Vlachette's player in on more action\u2014I felt like he got a little short shrift in this game. But perhaps I was simply pushing too hard for them to be in the same place at the same time doing the same thing. At the end, when Carnasso was herding people out, it didn't make any sense for him to need to keep Vlachette there, but he did, because I was afraid of cutting him out of the action. If he had been kicked out, perhaps something cooler could have happened, like Vlachette breaking in the Master Bedroom balcony to steal away Lady Lara in her grief. Anyway.<br/><br/>I had fantastic, great fun. The most fun I've had in my (short) roleplaying career.<br/><br/>Niggles:<br/><br/>1.I wasn't giving out enough Style. I wasn't giving out paltry amounts, but it was hard to give it out when most of the \u201cHell yeah, awesome!\u201d moments that the players contributed were contributed because they spent a Style point per the \u201cEstablish simple facts\u201d rule. It felt weird to give them back the Style they just spent. Were those \u201cfacts\u201d (an NPC jumping in at an opportune time, etc) too much for the \u201cEstablish simple facts\u201d rule? I'm not sure we're getting the spirit of the law correct here. I hesitate to smack those moments down, though, because they, as gamers can't help but say on the internet, \u201cbrought the awesome\u201d.<br/>2.Aspects weren't used as much as I thought they would be, considering each character had 4. This isn't really a problem, as it's the beginning of the game and we're still really working through the system. There were a couple cool moments with a tag and a Compels, though.<br/><br/>Hmm, if I think of more I'll amend this post. Thoughts, comments, and questions welcome!<br/><br/>P.S. After feeling like I needed to explicate every detail, I'm not sure that AP needs to be this long or detailed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239936/#Comment_239936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T14:30:21+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  2:30PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who hopes to start running HotB soon, I found this really helpful for starting to envision what I want the game to look and feel like. I, too, am a little worried that I won't be giving out style fast enough, especially since I'll be using the larp rules, which are style point hogs. The "free point per 15 minutes" rule suggested in the larp doesn't sit right, in part because I doubt people will be wearing watches, and checking cellphones to get the time just breaks the feel of the game.<br/><br/>Perhaps something involving toasts or taking a drink from a servant and getting a style point or two at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239943/#Comment_239943" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T15:20:05+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  3:20PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>As someone who hopes to start running HotB soon, I found this really helpful for starting to envision what I want the game to look and feel like.</blockquote>\nI'm glad!
