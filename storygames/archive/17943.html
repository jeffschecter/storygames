They've been on my mind for a week or two now, and I think this is probably the best place on the Internet to come and get these particular ideas dissected and picked apart, which they're in need of, as I'm not sure if I'm saying anything new, or even saying anything old in a new way, but I might be saying something quite interesting. So, here goes - and please, do your worstest.<br/><br/>I'd like to propose that there's an umbrella style of gaming I'll call <b>fiction-oriented gaming</b>, although you could just call it <b>fluffy</b> gaming if you'd like (fluff as opposed to crunch), and that this fiction-oriented gaming (F.O.G.) embraces not just storygames of the Forge-ish variety*, but also other styles of play, including conventionally GM'd freeform games, a significant proportion of LARP and a significant proportion of indisputably trad tabletop games, especially those where immersion [by which I always mean immersion in character] is valued.<br/><br/>Some core propositions:-<br/>~A~ all roleplaying games and storygames involve fiction (in the sense of things imagined and unreal), but not all roleplayers are involved in actively/deliberately/consciously telling a story (or even necessarily in telling a story at all), nor does the fiction emerging from their games necessarily have storylike qualities such as theme/premise, plot, structure and so on --- so you have to be very cautious about equating the "fiction" in roleplaying games and storygames with "story" --- "fiction" and "story" are not exactly coterminous --- they are <b>subtly</b> different concepts, and the subtleties matter.<br/>~B~ fiction-oriented games are games where fiction is at the heart of the gamers' gaming experience [contrast, for instance, games of pure hack-n-slash, or games heavily focused on probabalistic modelling] --- and by no means all fiction-oriented games are storygames of the Forge-ish variety.<br/>~C~ in particular, having fiction reliably at the heart of your gaming experience doesn't necessarily mean that every player at the table needs to have some institutionalised role in actively putting fiction at the heart of the gaming experience (e.g. shared narrative authority or aspects of your character's personality/beliefs that give big bonuses / automatic effects when they're brought into play) --- it could be that all present, or only the GM, or the GM and some assistant GMs have that function; it could be hard-wired into the rules to some extent; it could be a combination of these things. It is absolutely a non sequitur to suppose that simply because one particular player, or most of the players, have no specific role in actively putting fiction at the heart of the game, then the game won't have fiction at its heart to the fullest extent reasonably conceivable. A trad GM is perfectly adequate for the task, and can bring fiction to the heart of the game while leaving broad scope to the player characters to be the main influence on what actually happens.<br/><br/>Reasoning:-<br/><br/>There are at least 5 things I can think of that you can do with the fiction in RPGs/storygames:-<br/>(1) contribute to its creation by human agency;<br/>(2) contribute to its creation by applying rules and dice \u2013 this covers mechanics generally, not just probabilistic modelling;<br/>(3) explore it, in the sense of finding out more about it, pushing on its various buttons to see what happens;<br/>(4) feel as if you\u2019re a part of it \u2013 the central case of this is immersion;<br/>(5) use it to make the stakes of combat or other challenges seem greater.<br/><br/>Forge-ish games* tend to emphasise (1) above all else. I've said elsewhere that there's an element of (2) in there, and on reflection there's maybe some of (5) as well. I'm not denying, for a moment, that for some gamers (4) works best in storygames of the Forge-ish variety. But truly Forge-ish games, I contend, generally speaking aren't designed with (4) in mind. They're designed for (1) with maybe a bit of (2) and (5) thrown in. They may work great for some people for (4), but it's a side-effect, not the main purpose of the design.<br/><br/>But games that emphasise (3) and (4) also have fiction at their heart. Not necessarily story in any meaningful sense, but fiction, for sure. The gamers who play them value fiction over, for instance, challenge or probabalistic modelling. I for instance love to have complex fiction in my RPGs for its own sake, and I'm talking really about the complexity of the fiction, not the complexity of the rules (though there is a minor, indirect relationship between the two). And Forge-ish storygames tend to be less than optimal for (4) for many gamers, and are on the whole totally unsuited to (3), in my admittedly relatively limited experience.<br/><br/>The really fundamental point of this post is that whilst there are many things that tend to divide a certain segment of immersively-oriented trad gamers from a certain segment of Forge-ish storygamers, fiction-oriented gaming is a very important thing we all have in common (speaking as an immersively-oriented trad gamer myself). And that point has practical importance, because my experiences so far tend to suggest that although there may be gaming experiences that work for the trad lot but not for the storygamers, or vice-versa, it's eminently feasible for the same fiction to serve both groups' preferences at the same time at the same table - it just takes careful thought regarding how you structure the game. Indeed, I've found my own gaming experiences as an immersively-oriented trad gamer to be definitely enlivened by having a storygamer present, even though I wouldn't enjoy doing what they were doing their way as much as I enjoy doing my thing my way. And I really think that there's potential for the converse to be true too:- even though my preferred style of gaming is very individualistic and ego-centric, having a gamer like me at the table can work very well for storygamers, IMHO.<br/><br/>I've written up a rougher, possibly more contentious, definitely more self-indulgent exegesis on the same topic <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=100&amp;t=14893&amp;p=159880#p159792" rel="nofollow">here</a> for anyone who may be interested.<br/><br/>* <i>which tend to be narrow, focused games with an emphasis on shared narrative authority because the people who play them tend to value collective, collaborative creativity, often with an egalitarian twist in the sense of power-sharing between GM and players, so that a player's ideas brought to the table won't be "stifled" by the dreaded Viking Hat GM.

I've been looking up a lot of player styles, from Roger Caillois' four patterns of play and Bart Stewart's four player types to Mark Rosewater's Spike-Timmy-Johnny in Magic the Gathering and the ancient Greek's four temperaments. This is what I've come up with.<br/><br/>STYLES OF GAMING<br/><i>Expression:</i> Expressing who you are as a gamer through the game.<br/><del><i>Immersion:</i> Getting lost within an specific area of the game.</del> ([edit] 13-02-2012, when reading <a href="http://biobreak.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/guestbloggermania10-what-is-immersion/" rel="nofollow">this and</a> <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/?p=514" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, I came to the conclusion that immersion is an emergent state when several areas of the game or parts within one certain area interact.)<br/><i>Exploration:</i> Explore the options in the area.<br/><i>Competition:</i> Beat the others or the game itself.<br/><br/>AREAS OF THE GAME<br/>Person? (Not the PC, but the player itself)<br/>Group<br/><del>Premise</del> Meaning? ([edit] 11-02-2012, when reading <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134922/what_is_a_game_an_excerpt_from_.php?page=5" rel="nofollow">this article</a>)<br/>Setting<br/>Mechanics<br/>Fiction<br/><br/>What the different areas stands for is unimportant for this thread, and I will leave it open for more options in both categories. What's important to this thread is what happens if you combine fiction with the styles of gaming. How the player can express itself in the story by showing acting skills or bring creative ideas to the table, or how the player gets itself lost (immerse) within the story and forget time and place while playing, how the player can explore the fiction as it reveals itself through play or how the player can beat the others by achieving the character's goals or getting the player's ideas through, possibly by blocking other participants.<br/><br/>So what do I want to say with this? Mostly that the five points that you wrote isn't just about fiction, but something related to fiction. To me, it seems like it's just point 3-4 in your list (explore and immerse in fiction) that has anything to do with it. The rest belongs to different areas. Sure, game mechanics may affect the fiction, but that's more of an exploration of what the game mechanics can do.<br/><br/>I could also talk about how structures control the areas of the game (like social contract = structure for the group), but that's material for another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405724/#Comment_405724" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T06:42:20+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  6:42AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2013 6:43AM by omnifray.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Mostly that the five points that you wrote isn't just about fiction, but something related to fiction.

(1) basically is creative contribution to the fiction, in other words it's the active moulding of the fiction, done according to the standards of fiction existing in the player's mind. This keeps it very faithful to the genre, to what's believable or to whatever else matters to the player. Whereas (2), due to wonky or over-simplified or excessively detailed rules, can either screw up the fiction horribly or completely take over the centre-stage pushing fiction to the fringes. I don't see how you can assert that Story Now [<i>I hate that term, btw, as it's extremely loaded</i>] has nothing to do with fiction. Story Now is all about fiction. The point of my thread is partly that Story Now isn't the <b>*ONLY*</b> way of putting fiction to centre-stage in RPGs/storygames, but I would definitely accept that it's <b>*A*</b> way of doing so, and I don't really understand how you can intend to dispute that.<br/><br/>I'm also having trouble with the idea that premise can arise in any meaningful way outside the context of the fiction. Perhaps you can explain further?<br/><br/>I've been on the other side of a similar debate recently, arguing that "characters" are separate to "story". But really it seems to me that the wider fiction is so integral to the premise that you can't really have the premise without the fiction, and the premise would be totally meaningless without the fiction as a context. Whereas the characters still have some substance outside their primary context.<br/><br/>Edited to add:- isn't premise basically, at its core, something along the lines of the <b>*meaning*</b> players assign to whole swathes of the fiction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405732/#Comment_405732" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T08:27:08+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  8:27AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2013 8:29AM by Rickard.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't see how you can assert that Story Now [<i>I hate that term, btw, as it's extremely loaded</i>] has nothing to do with fiction. Story Now is all about fiction.</blockquote>\nI haven't said that Story Now had nothing to do with fiction. I just said that premise in the Story Now meaning - \xbb...is a thumbnail synopsis of your play. [examples follow, including "Egotism leads to loss of friends."\xab - is the strongest thing in Story Now. I do agree with what you said that premise is not the only way of creating fiction. Just as premise can create fiction, so can group, mechanics and setting ... and vice versa.<br/><br/>But does premise has to create fiction? No, not if you go beyond roleplaying games. I never said that, which I should have, but my categorisation doesn't just include roleplaying games. I believe that one must step outside what's considered roleplaying games to be able to evolve them.<br/><br/>Anyway, does premise has to create fiction? Take a look at Brenda Brathwaite's <a href="http://www.gamestm.co.uk/discuss/brenda-brathwaites-train/" rel="nofollow">Train</a>, where you play against an opponent who's going to deliver some tokens the fastest by train to an end station. Half-through the game, the game reveals that the trains are going to Auschwitz. Are you blindly going to follow the rules? That's the game's premise, which can give an understanding of the blind obedience during the WWII.<br/><br/>I think the difference between our opinions is that you're looking at the end result, where I look at the parts that create the end result. That said, what I'm writing is a theory under development. I'm not even sure if premise or mechanics should be there in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405734/#Comment_405734" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T09:03:51+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  9:03AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've nowt to say in response but if anyone should have a better idea for what to call Fiction-Oriented Gaming than that particular name, please let me know in this thread :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405737/#Comment_405737" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T10:34:33+00:00" title="February  8, 2013 10:34AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2013 10:34AM by omnifray.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Link to a poll I've started about this on TBP <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?674892-Fluff-versus-Crunch-Fiction-Oriented-Gaming-versus-System-Mattering" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I appreciate the irony of my using the title of an Edwards essay to refer to the antithesis of storygaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405740/#Comment_405740" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T10:50:42+00:00" title="February  8, 2013 10:50AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure this fits my experience.

(<i>Which is not a derogatory comment, coming from me. I identify as an immersively-oriented trad gamer myself, not a storygamer.</i>)<br/><br/>Anyway, the *World games may be storyish, but Montsegur 1244 they ain't, and OctaNe they ain't either.<br/><br/>How are NPCs in a "proper" trad game <b>not</b> killable?? If you give it stats, the players can try to kill it. I mean, in AD&amp;D 1st edition players would occasionally try to take out Orcus, or even Thor FHS.<br/><br/>But if due to the way the mechanics work the system imposes no real constraints on what the players can do, you're not exploring the fiction from within, you're creating it from outside, IMHO. And it also robs the way you affect the world of "meaningfulness", IMHO, and this time very much YMMV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405745/#Comment_405745" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T12:04:28+00:00" title="February  8, 2013 12:04PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand: <a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/im-beginning-to-doubt-your-commitment_25.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/im-beginning-to-doubt-your-commitment_25.html</a><br/><br/>Why do you say the mechanics impose no constraints on the player or character?

Remember, I was playing a *hack* of DW, not pure DW. I think a lot came down to the fact that it was GM'd in a relatively trad style. A reasonably good relatively trad style.\n<blockquote>Why do you say the mechanics impose no constraints on the player or character? I don't think it's a valid move in Apocalypse world for a Gunlugger to fly, unless the existence of something like a helicopter backpack has been established for example.</blockquote>\nActually I'm not sure that I was saying that the mechanics impose no constraints on PCs in *World games. On the contrary, my description of the *World hack I played as relatively trad implies (to me, at least) that there were indeed constraints on the player characters [not the only feature of trad play, and definitely not incompatible with storygaming, but definitely a regular feature of pretty much all trad play I've seen]. And for the record, it definitely felt as if there were constraints on the PCs in the game I played.\n<blockquote>Also, if the theory is that no storygame is X, I'm not sure how useful it is to say that all the ones that don't fit are not really story games.<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote>It sounds like "fiction-oriented gaming" and "story games" are the same thing...</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">@FigureFour</a>, I'm guessing that either we're using very different definitions of storygames, or you've never seen good fiction-oriented trad gaming. <br/><br/>To me, a storygame in the primary sense of the word is a game that emphasises "our story" over "my character", a game where what the players are primarily focused on is their collective creativity, and a game with an egalitarian distribution of narrative authority, or at least more egalitarian than AD&amp;D 1st edition.<br/><br/>Some people do use the word "storygame" as if it meant "fiction-oriented RPG". My point is that there is fiction-oriented RPG play out there that's nothing like storygaming in the primary sense of the word I gave two sentences ago. If you want to call those fiction-oriented RPGs storygames because they're fiction-oriented, well, I don't like that use of the term, but fair enough, let's not argue semantics. If on the other hand you don't believe me when I say that there's a lot of fiction-oriented RPG play out there that's nothing like storygaming in the primary sense - then maybe your experience of trad RPGs has been limited to things like WotC D&amp;D (3rd ed., 3.5, 4e), Pathfinder, that kind of thing. Maybe you've mainly seen trad games focused on simulation in the sense of probabalistic modelling, or challenge/tactics. A lot of trad gaming has very little in common with that style of play, and it's definitely trad, has existed since the dawn of the hobby and is very different to storygaming in the primary sense of the word.<br/><br/>The point of this thread, of course, is that although there is that huge element of difference, there is also *some* common ground that we can build on.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/summerdown">@summerdown</a>, as I say, I think different people use the word "storygame" in different ways. Some people use it in the sense of Forge-inspired storygames especially of the GM-less variety or at least with shared narrative authority. Some use it to mean fiction-oriented RPGs. And some people wrongly believe that you can't have a fiction-oriented game without at least having hardwired mechanical support for characters' beliefs, social conflict mechanics and that sort of thing. To those people it may be difficult to see a distinction between storygames in the primary sense of the word and fiction-oriented RPGs, but how do they explain the experience of countless trad gamers interested first and foremost in the fiction but who prefer not to have personality mechanics or social conflict mechanics?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405784/#Comment_405784" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T07:55:30+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  7:55AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And some people wrongly believe that you can't have a fiction-oriented game without at least having hardwired mechanical support for characters' beliefs, social conflict mechanics and that sort of thing.

In Forge terms, it's a preferred Technical Agenda. In other words, two people both like to play games that create interesting fiction or stories, and one finds that what you're calling "story game mechanics" helps them achieve that better, whereas another prefers the feeling of playing in a more "trad" style (e.g. Call of Cthulhu, which is clearly not designed either for reality simulation or strategical competition). They have the same (or similar) goals, but like using different mechanics to get there.<br/><br/>The only particular important distinction I can see is that "Narrativist" (or Story Now) play, as defined by Ron Edwards, is <i>very</i> hard to pull off without certain mechanics. Not impossible, of course, but very very difficult. So if that's your definition of "story game", you're going to lean harder in that direction, most likely.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405788/#Comment_405788" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T09:28:02+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  9:28AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2013 9:28AM by omnifray.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, I think the starting point is that there are important differences in what people find "interesting" in/about/to do with the fiction at hand. Some find that their interest is in the creation of interesting fiction, in the theme/premise being explored and above all in their own creative contribution as part of a creative group jointly responsible for the fiction. Others care not a jot about their creative contribution as part of a creative group, but value the experience of living the fiction, or of experimenting <b>within</b> its bounds and confines. Call of Cthulhu, I would say, is intended to encourage fiction-oriented trad gaming, though BRP generally speaking IMHO, YMMV, from my relatively limited experience of it has a little bit of the curse of the probabalistic model about it, not that I particularly mind that. But many people play CoC because they want to be drawn into the horror of the situation, and not because they want to have any hand in moulding it. They have a fundamentally different attitude to the fiction than someone playing, say, OctaNe.<br/><br/>The above notwithstanding, I am optimistic about finding new ways to have the same plate of fiction feed some very different diners who appreciate it in very different ways at the same table. The storygamer is like a restaurant critic who wants to produce a polished piece as a reaction to the meal. The immersively-oriented trad gamer is more like a gourmet eater who just wants to gorge himself on the finest food available and is less fussed about creating witty, readable prose drawing on the technical niceties of the chef's accomplishments and the variety of ingredients. Then there are other trad gamers who are experimental eaters, who spend the meal experimenting with whether this mouthful goes best with this or that other mouthful, and which wine balances it best. Those are the ones more focused on exploration and less on creation or experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405792/#Comment_405792" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T09:56:13+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  9:56AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, did this go down last night?

That's cause there's not a lot of other places to discuss those sorts of things, so folks interested in that tended to gravitate here: Beyond that, exploring cool new ways to play any sort of game is a welcome topic here.

You didn't hear it from me. You heard it from the admin of this site! Maybe I'm misinterpreting the phrase, taking it out of context, but to me, that sentence there strongly implies that "dirty hippie games" tend to be the ones that prioritise "our story" over "my character", whatever that means. Personally, I think it can bear quite a sensible meaning. Games where the focus is on the collective creative agenda and not on the individual immersive experience. Which chimes nicely with the way that "dirty hippie" games are all about egalitarian collaboration, and immersively-oriented trad games (my preferred type) are all about individualistic, ego-centric indulgence of character, regardless of its impact on a creative agenda that may or may not even exist in any meaningful sense for the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405809/#Comment_405809" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T15:40:01+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  3:40PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you just plain ignore all of the "or"s in that sentence?<br/><br/>'smaller press games... like roleplaying games that focus more on relationships, <b>or</b> story-building, <b>or</b> on "our story" over "my character".

I believe "or" can sometimes be conjunctive, sometimes disjunctive, sometimes ambiguous. It would be absurd to contend that a game that focuses more on relationships can't also be one that focuses more on story-building or that focuses on "our story" over "my character". On the contrary, a more natural reading of the post is that the writer associated those three things very much together in his mind.\n<blockquote>And as you show, the whole section starts with "A Story Game is another word for Role Playing Game".</blockquote>\nI not only quoted it in full but, in the interests of full and frank disclosure, specifically adverted to that point in my comment. However my feeling is that the RPG/storygame community as a whole does not always use "storygame" as coterminous with "RPG". The trouble is that the word gets used in different ways, often even by the same people.<br/><br/>The way I read the Story_Games post the writer is trying to be inclusive as far as the general use of the forum is concerned, so that everyone feels welcome and able to join / speak up, but at the same time the writer is trying to emphasise that the *real* focus of the site (though other topics are welcome) is on storygames in a narrower sense. After all, there's a reason why the site's called "story-games" and not the more widely used term "RPGs". And the reason is that whilst in some sense the word "storygame" can bear a wider meaning, it tends to have certain specific connotations, of "hippy indie" gaming, of Forge-inspired games, of games with shared narrative authority or which are even GMless.\n<blockquote>At this point I'm really starting to become convinced that you are willfully misinterpreting other's statements and disingenuously redefining terms.</blockquote>\nYou simply can't justify that assertion, given the way I quoted the Story_Games post at length and specifically adverted to the part of it that was contrary to my interpretation of it. I can't understand how anyone could dispute that the word "storygames" has different connotations to the word "RPGs", not in the sense that they can't cover the same territory, but in the sense that the word "storygames" tends to be associated with certain styles of play. It may bear a core meaning and a wider meaning, but it's the core meaning that's interesting. Also it's a value-laden term because it implies that "story" is the focus of the game, which for many RPGs and for many fiction-oriented RPGs it's not, so using it as a synonym for "RPG" is liable to lead to confusion.\n<blockquote> Why are you doing this?</blockquote>\nWhat are you going to ask me next - have I stopped beating my wife yet?\n<blockquote>That said, I'd still like to know (from anyone, really) what examples of story games actually emphasize "our story" over "my character."

OctaNe and Montsegur 1244 are pretty good examples IMHO. OctaNe because there's no real potential for in-character dialogue but plenty for narration (mind you I only have one game to go off, and I've never read the rules, so it may be down to how it was GM'd/facilitated). Montsegur 1244 because of all the chopping and changing of characters and roles for the sake of the game and the "story".\n<blockquote><br/>Well, Universalis is almost the definition of "dirty hippy" and isn't at all "egalitarian collaboration," and in a great many ways it's (at least whenever I've played it) very much "individualistic, ego-centric indulgence of x", where x can be character, theme, "story", or whatever, but very much in the individualistic and ego-centric jazz, and to hell with creative agenda in a great many cases. </blockquote>\nDon't know it.

The fiction is just a backdrop to a lot of dice-rolling and adding and subtracting. Not saying it can't be tactically interesting or that the participants don't have fun, but fiction most definitely isn't at the heart of the players' experience of the game in any meaningful sense. The fiction is just a mechanic for presenting a variety of challenges. It isn't enjoyed for its own sake. It's a means to an end, whereas in immersively-oriented trad gaming (which you could also do with D&amp;D 3.5, of course, though more easily with AD&amp;D) the fiction is an end in itself. Where this differs from storygaming in the core sense is that it's the experience of the fiction, rather than its creation, that immersively-oriented trad gaming focuses on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405835/#Comment_405835" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T04:55:57+00:00" title="February 10, 2013  4:55AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, that's why I said 'hack-and-slash AD&amp;D' instead of just 'AD&amp;D'.

The fiction is merely a mechanical tool. The players aren't primarily thinking about what the game is actually simulating, but only about *how* it's simulating it, and how to manipulate that simulation for maximum damage to the enemy and minimum damage to self. It's a glorified game of chess. You call Chess-pieces by evocative names, King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, and the way a knight moves simulates a horse jumping, and the way a bishop moves maybe simulates the difference between the spiritual and the temporal, but your focus isn't on the fictional elements, it's on how they're represented technically. Whilst in some abstract sense the simulation is entirely and in its whole being a simulation of fiction, what matters isn't the abstract concept of the game, but the players' experience of the game. And the players' experience of the game is one of moving pieces around a chess board, not one of thinking primarily in terms of fiction. In a purely hack-n-slash RPG, or let's rather call it a wargame, sure, the players occasionally think in fictional terms, but as a form of tactical thinking. They may appeal to what's believable to justify certain interpretations of the rules. But they're just as likely, no, more likely to be thinking about how different bonuses add to the dice, and selecting combinations of feats and manoeuvres according to what gives the best advantage on the dice, and in that sense, I suppose, contrary to what I said before, it's meta. They're thinking from outside of their character and outside of the fiction about how to manipulate the workings of a machine for best tactical advantage. This style of play, I contend, has fiction at its periphery, not at its centre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405840/#Comment_405840" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T06:10:41+00:00" title="February 10, 2013  6:10AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... storygamers are too many chiefs and not enough indians who are all fighting to be GM, and storygames aren't RPGs.

Who cares what I think does or doesn't count as an RPG. Obviously the word RPG is a word, thus, a part of language. Language is a convention for communication. It bears whatever meaning is attributed to it in communication. CHIEFS is my game and if I want to call it not an RPG then isn't that up to me? Everything else is semantics. If you're going to press me on it, I would say the most obvious etymologically sound sense of "roleplaying game" [though obviously not the only sense in which the term is used] is a game where the central point is to play the role of a character, rather than something else, such as constructing a story. A few years ago it was my belief that tabletop RPGs (of which I was and remain a great fan) were universally really games of storytelling and not really games of roleplaying. Now I feel differently. Now I feel that most tabletop RPGs and probably most of what most people would call storygames really are games of roleplaying. <br/><br/>There might be one or two fringe cases of storygames where it's harder to say for sure. OctaNe is probably the best example I can think of, although you can certainly make a case for OctaNe or Mouse Guard being an RPG, and the case is probably much stronger for Fiasco or Montsegur 1244 where you can spend more or less the whole time actually roleplaying. All I would say is that in any RPG/storygame, if you've got narrative authority and you're narrating what your character's doing, not engaging in dialogue, not performing an illocutionary act in simply choosing your character's actions, but actually engaging in storytelling about what your character's doing, then at that exact instant, you're storytelling and not really roleplaying. Not that one activity is necessarily more valid or more fun than the other. And that certainly doesn't mean that at other times during the game you're not roleplaying, and doesn't mean that the game necessarily isn't a roleplaying game, or more about roleplaying than about storytelling. So, it's more a question of different shades of grey, rather than black and white. <br/><br/>In the same way, many an RPG verges into wargame territory on occasions, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's actually stopped being an RPG, but then again, there may come a point when they do. How much of a game has to be spent with players saying "I'll move my fighter 4 squares forwards" and "My fighter's got 26 hitpoints left so I'll use a surge" before it's more about the wargaming than it is about the roleplaying? Answer:- how long is a piece of string? <br/><br/>For the record, many of my favourite gaming experiences have been dungeoncrawls, both LARP and, in at least one instance I can think of, tabletop. They weren't played in what I would think of as a purely hack-n-slash way, but there was a very great amount of combat in all of them.<br/><br/>None of this has anything to do with there being One True Way. In fact, if you've been following my posts enough to justify your little rant, you'll know that I think that immersion is a very much individual psychological phenomenon, which works differently for different people. Therefore, even in terms of immersively-oriented trad roleplay, there can't be One True Way, however much I might like mine. And then it would just be silly beyond words to suggest that because what someone enjoys is *not* immersion, but something else, that that is not "legitimate". Enjoyment is, after all, merely a question of fact, and within certainly very broadly set bounds (e.g. risk of harm to others), to each his own.<br/><br/>I don't think I've accused anyone of persecuting me in relation to this particular topic. The main ad hominem thing I have to say is that there are some posters who seem more curious about and interested in my personal psychological quirks than the truth or falsehood of my ideas. And interesting though it is for me to introspectively analyse my many foibles, I really feel it gains nothing for the online RPG community as a whole, and should probably stop.<br/><br/>I don't really understand why you feel the need to be so defensive about whether certain styles of play should or shouldn't be classed as roleplaying. In short, I think you're being hypersensitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405849/#Comment_405849" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T09:01:45+00:00" title="February 10, 2013  9:01AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2013 9:08AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What I'm saying is that in a game of that latter type, the *players* are focused on numbers, dice and rules. </blockquote>\n...which are all expressing things about a fictional character in a fictional situation!

I'm not interested in some purely behavioural study based wholly on external observation and purporting to classify what gamers do in specific situations and provide an anatomy of roleplaying techniques. What I'm interested in is what the gamers are actually getting out of the fiction - what they're actually enjoying about it. If you don't believe that we can gain at least some modest insight into that by asking people how they feel about different aspects of gaming or by asking them what they enjoy about it and by relying on gamers' self-reported experiences, we're not going to get anywhere.<br/><br/>Let me give this as an illustration. You could have two players, A and B, sitting at the same table, playing what looks from the outside like a hack-n-slashy wargame. Player A is rolling the dice and just thinking about the numbers, the position of the miniatures, the advantages this feat or that feat gives etc. Only from a very dry, technical perspective can that be linked to the fiction. Player B on the other hand is actually immersed in character, and/or alternatively/additionally is thinking about narrative elements like the way that the use of poison is a betrayal of his character's principles but a sacrifice he's willing to make to get revenge on his beloved's murderer, etc. Player B is getting Fiction-Oriented Gaming out of this set-up. Player A isn't.<br/><br/>Plenty of times I've been immersed in character in MET-LARP combat notwithstanding its obscene crunchiness (obscene by the standards of LARP - not by the standards of tabletop). I'm sure there were others present who, unhappily as they would see it, were too tripped up by the mechanical/numerical details to be able to enjoy the fiction. After all, there've probably been occasions when I too have found MET-LARP combat counter-immersive.<br/><br/>So yes, what I'm interested is very much the enjoyment that the player is getting out of the game. What are they enjoying about it and why? If gaming theory doesn't try to address that question, then I don't really see what the point of it is, save at best as an exercise in commercial exploitation of ideas (e.g. theorise about what will cause the most number of sales).<br/><br/>What is the point for instance of assertions like the rather dubious assertion that incoherent games produce dysfunctional play, if dysfunctional play is not unenjoyable? The ONLY thing that fundamentally matters about roleplaying games / storygames and varies wildly from group to group and game to game is the fun they provide. We have to get to the heart of that fun. And if theory isn't getting us there, then let's stop theorising and just get on with playing.<br/><br/>I have no time for descriptions of playstyles that aren't anchored in and don't address what makes the game fun for players or why they play the way they do. And the least unreliable of all the unreliable guides to that is self-reported experience, IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405855/#Comment_405855" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T11:44:50+00:00" title="February 10, 2013 11:44AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2013 11:47AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't ask me what the point of those assertions are, ask someone who believes in them.

Yes, some people are more interested in the mechanical "bits" of a game even when they are divorced from "the fiction" (whatever that is). Yes, some people like to create a cool story even if it's not coloured in with lots of fictional details. Yes, some people like to "immerse" selfishly in a character, and don't care if either of those two first things happen. We all have our preferences, can't argue with that.<br/><br/>I'm not so sure what new understanding this gives us, however. The distinction between "story game" and "fiction-oriented game" seems very thin to me, if it even is something we can agree on at all (as JDCorley points out).<br/><br/>You'll also notice that there is a slight subtext of "my way is the best way to play, the REAL roleplaying" (which has a lot to do with your use of the word "roleplaying" to mean, basically, how you like to play - there's no special need to assume that the activity of "roleplaying" is necessarily connected to immersion or "fiction-firstness", after all).

I don't intend this as a slight on wargames or hack-n-slash in RPGs. What I mean to do is illustrate that a fictional framework in which the mechanics are set doesn't make a mechanical exercise into an exercise with fiction at the heart of the gamers' experience. The advantages of D&amp;D feats make sense, by and large, by means of simple arithmetic. Would you regard a conventional game of Warhammer Fantasy Battle as more similar to a roleplaying game or to Monopoly? Surely Monopoly, right? It's a game with fiction but it doesn't put fiction at the heart of the players' gaming experience. [Obviously that must vary from player to player, but I'm talking about generalities here.] And some dungeoncrawls are basically a very small-scale version of Warhammer Fantasy Battle with slightly different mechanics.\n<blockquote>Back to the drawing board, try again.  Maybe you are looking for emotional investment? Some players play with emotional investment into character action and some do not?</blockquote>\nWell you could be playing a purely fiction-oriented game and not feel invested in the character or what they're doing because you've only just started playing or because you don't feel satisfied with the character or because you just don't feel affective empathy towards your fictional character. Doesn't sound like great fiction-oriented gaming, but I think it's still technically in the same box.<br/><br/>Anyway if you're so sure that I'm wrong with my concept, maybe you can try to help me out with this:- what is it that immersively-oriented trad roleplaying games and Forge-inspired storygames of the less immersive variety have in common with each other and not with a game of Warhammer Fantasy Battle or *purely* hack-n-slash dungeoncrawling? I accept that emotional investment in character action is a reasonable stab at it but I don't think it's the whole truth. Besides which "character action" is really basically just the central aspect of the fiction from the point of view of the gamers' experience. So you might as well talk about emotional investment in the fiction, which is a hair's breadth I suppose from saying that the gamers have the fiction at the heart of their gaming experience, and on that interpretation of what you've said, you end up meaning virtually (not exactly) the same as what I explained in the OP.\n<blockquote>And what does immersion have to do with this? I'm looking back at the OP and it doesn't seem to have anything to do with immersion.

If you want to call OctaNe or a purely hack-n-slash session of D&amp;D 4e or even a game of WHFB roleplaying, it doesn't hurt anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405869/#Comment_405869" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T13:21:08+00:00" title="February 10, 2013  1:21PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recommend taking the time, Omnifray.<br/><br/>I really, really do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405872/#Comment_405872" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T13:45:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2013  1:45PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Anyway if you're so sure that I'm wrong with my concept, maybe you can try to help me out with this:- what is it that immersively-oriented trad roleplaying games and Forge-inspired storygames of the less immersive variety have in common with each other and not with a game of Warhammer Fantasy Battle or *purely* hack-n-slash dungeoncrawling?

While they may exist in the trad game, their use may well be largely ignored or simplified to make them much "lumpier".<br/><br/>Or not. Trad games are all over the place with rules, mechanics, and player attitudes towards their consistent use. <br/><br/>A given group seeking Immersionist Fun may find they really enjoy digging in and using the full rules for one sort of activity, and completely skip over another whole section of rules for a different activity in favor of discussion/first person character play.<br/><br/>I was surprised in some prior discussions with Immersionist Fun loving folks who noted they used some rules which I was sure I'd never, ever want to use if I personally was looking for Imm-Fun. Didn't distract them even a little bit, and they even found my suggestion that such rules-use seemed wildly at odds with Imm-fun seeking to be completely absurd.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>With exceptions, neither type is terribly "game-y". Players tend to be playing more to see what happens next than some sort of victory for their character. Both styles of play also tend towards functionally keeping the actual players in the game and active.

At least not a distinction that moves one to being more like a wargame.  (Also we do not agree on what "immersion" means so I won't go into that again, just remember that last time we discussed it we did not agree at all.)</blockquote>\nHuh? You don't think there's a useful way to distinguish hack-n-slash dungeoncrawls, other "trad" RPGs and Forge-inspired storygames? Really??<br/><br/>As for the immersion thing, others have commented (see later in this post).\n<blockquote><br/>In general, they both tend to move away from interest in finely grained mechanics of the Physics Simulation variety. ...<br/><br/>Or not. ... <br/><br/>A given group seeking Immersionist Fun may find they really enjoy digging in and using the full rules for one sort of activity, and completely skip over another whole section of rules for a different activity in favor of discussion/first person character play.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>With exceptions, neither type is terribly "game-y".</blockquote>\nI think that's all pretty much on the money. As for the inconsistent use of complex rules for some things and simple for others, I think there's method in their madness. It's a combination of avoiding mechanics they find dissociative and feeling at ease with mechanics they are very familiar with. Familiarity undoubtedly helps complex rules fade into the background psychologically, though it's by no means the alpha and omega of that particular story.\n<blockquote>it's often rare for a character to die unless it somehow fits with what the controlling player themself wants, although immersionists seem to want at least the illusion of that possibility to make the tense scenes feel more threatening and desperate.<br/><br/>( From what I can tell, in practical terms, immersionists functionally want a tiny, miniscule chance that their character could die at any moment in a reasonable circumstance, but one that never is actually likely to come up. ...)</blockquote>\nI think that's broadly right. In immersively-oriented games where character death is very frequent, it may be easy to restore a dead character to life, or they may have some kind of reincarnation/rebirth ability. Now, the Pundit would argue that we have to man up and take the risk of character death on the chin. I guess there needs to be enough risk of death for the immersively-oriented player to suspend their disbelief that the risks are as real as they would be if the fictional situation were real. Where that threshold lies varies from player to player. In my forthcoming game Soul's Calling, there is potential for very high risks of death, but there are many tricks for minimising that risk. Combat can be run by GM-arbitration with a little bit of dice-rolling mixed in. If you use the hard rules for combat, the GM can give you re-rolls for Fate (it's his call when this happens in the basic edition of the game). Beyond that, it's up to the GM to be aware of the probabilities and give the players a reasonable chance of seeking out enemies their characters can slay, or parlaying or avoiding combat. I'm relying to an extent on players being as cautious as their characters would, if they knew death to be a real risk. But I've also got a great trick for raising the dead. (In-fiction sadly. If I manage it in real life I'll let you know.)\n<blockquote><br/>Oh, I absolutely agree that there other ways to be involved deeply in a game, and cognitive flow is as good an an umbrella term as any for all of them collectively.<br/><br/>I just feel that we should all agree to simply let the folks who want to describe "1st person in-character, in-setting fun" plain have the term <i>Immersion</i> to describe that in the short-hand, without people nit-picking them to death over the existence of other sorts of fun that you can be immersed in.<br/></blockquote>\nExactly. This is very important to me, because storygamers have the term storygame to communicate quickly and conveniently that a particular game is of the "hippy indie" / "narrative" variety, and wowzer, they have those extra words for it too. Whereas immersively-oriented gamers have only the word "immersion".<br/><br/>In the interests of fairness, it's only right to observe that a few years ago I would have felt that it was reasonable to use the word "immersion" in other senses. But for me the clincher is this. "Deep engagement" with a game or "committed involvement" in a game or "emotional attachment" to play - these things are really just synonymous with "fun" of a "non-casual" variety. The vast majority of games, with the exclusion of a few explicitly Beer &amp; Pretzels-oriented games, are designed to at least be capable of being played in a deeply committed way. There's really no need for a special term for such games. Insofar as a player is deeply committed to a particular aspect of a game, or deeply engaged with it, or emotionally attached to it, what really matters is the aspect of the game they're engaged with - tactics, story, system/mechanics, real-world social interaction, whatever. Only in the case of immersion in character is there really a strong need for specific terminology, and that's partly because "character-focused" would be interpreted by a lot of people as meaning essentially "character-driven, story-focused, narrativist". The immersive roleplayer is character-focused, but he's unlikely to be a storygamer, though some of them are, inasmuch as some people find their immersion [in character] primarily in storygaming, and game with an equal love of both.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405926/#Comment_405926" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T09:16:06+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  9:16AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, I thought storygames meant Forge-based games, but the last couple of months I've discovered that the term seems like a result from all these endless (and to me pointless) "This is not a roleplaying game" discussions, where the term is more including than some people's interpretation of \xbbroleplaying games\xab.

He would certainly not regard RPGs as storygames. To him the two are mutually exclusive. As you acknowledge, the debate over what is or isn't an RPG doesn't add much value to anything. I certainly don't think that "storygame" is considered by many people to be a *wider* term than RPG. Some people use it to mean RPGs concerning fiction with storylike qualities, or essentially fiction-oriented RPGs. Some use it to mean RPGs in general, at least some of the time. But for most people I think it means Forge games and their ilk, or perhaps fiction-oriented RPGs.<br/><br/>* and entirely deliberately controversial, not to mention deliberately offensive (much though I personally like a lot of what he does, I don't think his attitude towards storygamers is remotely reasonable)\n<blockquote>There are heaps of other words for loosing-yourself-into-the-character-immersion, where \xbbmethod acting\xab is the most common one.</blockquote>\nMethod acting is I suppose one instance of the professional use of immersion, by trained actors and actresses, to produce art.

It's shorthand for "feeling as if you're present in the game-world" I guess, which is virtually synonymous (from the point of view of most immersive gamers' experience, maybe not all) with immersion [in character] if only because the only way for you to be present in the game-world would normally be as your character. But the use of the word "presence" would be misunderstood / is too obscure. How would you use it in context? "This game creates presence"? I suppose maybe "This game is intended to give you a feeling of being present in the game-world as your character", but woah, what a mouthful.<br/><br/>"Immersion" is still the only suitable term.\n<blockquote>"...of so many gamers"? Can you give a number? My impression is that it's mostly LARP gamers that talk about immersion. Beyond Role and Play is LARP theory, for example.</blockquote>\nWell my polls on TBP have had well over a hundred people voting for options that apply only for immersion in character. Some of them may have mis-voted, but surely not most. And it's exceptionally rare for a poll on TBP to get more than about 300 votes, so if we're looking at what proportion of gamers immerse enough to care about and articulate it then... I'm guessing - 40% to 50% of gamers enthusiastic enough about gaming to use Internet forums? Maybe 10% to 20% of gamers generally? And that's only for immersion in character recognised as such by the gamer. I contend that many gamers experience light levels of immersion without ever really analysing it or being able to articulate how it enhances their gaming experience. That would be another 10% to 20% of gamers generally (maybe 5% of those enthusiastic enough to use Internet forums). So I would say, at a guess, a third of gamers experience some level of enjoyment from immersion in character, though maybe only half of those (a sixth of all gamers) could articulate it, and these proportions are higher for those who care enough about RPGs to participate in online forum discussions. Obviously, I'm conscious that this is educated guesswork, not hard facts. But the whole existence of theRPGSite is basically predicated on two things - immersion and freedom of expression without caring about causing offence. That's a pretty reasonable indication by itself that this playstyle has a committed following.\n<blockquote>What I've showed with my links is that immersion exist in other forms.

Where that's not the case, we don't need a separate concept of immersion. Why not? Take "losing yourself in the story". This is surely promoted by exactly the same things that promote enjoyable "story" for that player. "Losing yourself in the strategy" - this is surely promoted by whatever makes for enjoyable strategy. There is no need for separate terms in gaming theory. Because games that do these things appeal not just to players who lose themselves in the story or strategy as the case may be, but also to gamers who game for the story or strategy without losing themselves in it. There is no material or systematically analysable difference between how such games must operate if they are to best appeal to those who love losing themselves in those games and how they must operate if they are to appeal to those who either don't lose themselves in those games or don't care whether they do or not. Counter-examples, please, if I am wrong. <br/><br/>In almost the same way, for immersion-in-character, the single defining feature is that you feel somewhat as if you are your character, you suspend your disbelief in being them. Whether you do so to the point of "losing yourself" in the character or to a milder level is again more or less irrelevant from the point of view of game-design. The game designer's task is the same whether s/he wants to appeal to those gamers who lose themselves in being the character or to those gamers who like to feel somewhat as if they are their character without necessarily losing themselves in the character. The importance of immersion as a concept from a game-design, game-advertising or game-organising point of view is not the "losing yourself" but rather the "feeling somewhat as if you are your character" even if that may be to a lighter level where you DON'T lose yourself in it. It's the aim of identification-with-character* that's important in practical terms, not the depth of it.<br/><br/>* "identification" in the sense of seeing the character as an extension of self, or seeing the self as an extension of the character, or seeing self and character as unified... not "identification" in the sense of "perceiving similarity between"\n<blockquote>Well, the character sheet can still say "greedy", is that what you're asking?

But let me take a stab at illustrating how central the character is to immersion, and how peripheral the world is. Once you have the character, you get to know them like an imaginary friend. They are then there for you to immerse into because you've created that construct for yourself in your mind. You don't need to think hard about the game-world in its different aspects. Simply close your eyes, imagine being your character in a vague, undefined environment and dwell on your character's burning drives and motivations. Sure, these drives/motivations exist in a context, but that context doesn't need more than the vaguest definition for immersion to begin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405964/#Comment_405964" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T16:47:56+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  4:47PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for a quick reference:\n<blockquote>I certainly don't think that "storygame" is considered by many people to be a *wider* term than RPG. </blockquote>\nI've met lots of people who do. I am one of those: to me "story game" is a broader term than "roleplaying game", that's the way the term makes the most sense to me. It's a game that's based on or creates a sensible narrative of some kind, and where that narrative is important to the gameplay. So that's not a non-existent interpretation of the term.

Can this meaningfully be called a storygame?<br/><br/>Obviously some people might say it can't be meaningfully called an RPG, but you are technically playing the role of your character, just in a very pawn-like, remote way. And, it's D&amp;D. I mean, it's the grandfather of all roleplaying games, or at least has a reasonable claim to be.

This conclusion made me change my first post in this thread.</blockquote>\nComplicated. I would say too complicated to be of interest outside obscure threads like this one.<br/><br/>For me the point is this. OK so the word "immersion" literally connotes "being plunged into", and if we wanted to use the word purely in the broadest literal sense you could be "plunged into" the game in the sense of engrossment/flow or "plunged into" the fiction in the sense of suspension of disbelief. But when we talk about immersive roleplaying games, by and large we're all talking about games that focus on suspension of disbelief in being the character. For some people that suspension of disbelief may be very heightened, with deep engrossment not just in the game but in the suspension of disbelief itself, such as to lead the gamer to experience physiological reactions to fictional stimuli. (I've been there.)  So that is a triple-plunging:- you're suspending disbelief; you're engrossed; you're engrossed in suspending disbelief. But we all know that suspension of disbelief in being the character tends, for many gamers, to be peculiarly likely to lead to that triple-plunging. And the whole reason why it's so important to so many gamers is that that likelihood is (for them, not for everyone) so keen. And the key ingredient in that process is the suspension of disbelief in being the character.<br/><br/>The association between suspension of disbelief and engrossment is merely an association, though a close one. <br/><br/>If a game delivers on suspension of disbelief (for Person A), then it will deliver (for Person A) what a person typically expects/seeks in a game of immersive roleplay. Person A might be the sort to experience deep or light engrossment in that experience of suspended disbelief, but in either event, will be able to find what they're seeking in the game. Because, as far as general game design goes, the same tools deliver suspension of disbelief, whether you are deeply or lightly engrossed therein. Those tools do vary somewhat from gamer to gamer, but the same tools that produce light engrossment in suspension of disbelief also produce heavier engrossment for the same gamer, if applied with greater intensity.<br/><br/>And if that isn't gobbledegook, then I've never posted gobbledegook on the Internet in all my life!!!\n<blockquote><blockquote>Huh?

Would you consider this hypothetical game you're describing a roleplaying game?<br/><br/>I wouldn't. I would call it a board game.<br/><br/>However, I know that I can't really defend this point of view: it's a personal opinion on my part. And it's a fine line.<br/><br/>If you consider what you've described (something like the "Heroquest" board game) a roleplaying game, then for you there are games which are "roleplaying games" but not "story games". That's fine with me! <br/><br/>But it doesn't discount all those "story games" which are not RPGs. It just means they are two overlapping terms.<br/><br/>And that is just *my* use of the term "story game".

Why didn't you make this clearer before?<br/><br/>Weird, though, that you would therefore apparently seem to regard Call of Cthulhu or Vampire: the Masquerade as closer to being a Forge game than to being a trad RPG. Very weird.\n<blockquote>I have no idea what this has to do with the topic of "fiction-first" games, now we're classifying gamers again? Uh great I guess, here we go again.</blockquote>\nClearly, almost any classification of games implies the potential, at least, for classifying gamers. In this case it's a question of gamers' preferences versus the experience of playing certain games. The two may align. Of course, an individual gamer's preferences may vary with the phases of the moon, but generally it's just a handy mental shortcut to use the game for the gamer and the gamer for the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406478/#Comment_406478" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T20:05:00+00:00" title="February 17, 2013  8:05PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this all might make more sense if you can give some examples of games which are RPGs but are not "fiction-first".<br/><br/>What does such a game look like, and what makes you qualify as "not fiction-first"?<br/><br/>The next step will be to look at "Forge-inspired games", and see if they have any of these features.

Why didn't you make this clearer before?</blockquote>\nBecause it didn't have anything to do with your OP? Your OP still fails to differentiate between story-game play of Vampire and hack-and-slash play of Vampire. They are both equally fiction-first.  You have not explained in the least why hack-and-slash play is not fiction-first.  It has to be. A "+2 greatsword", a cool part of my AD&amp;D hack-and-slash play in college, is something that entirely exists in the fiction, and my play was greatly concerned with its fictional effectiveness, situation and deployment. Tactics in a fictional situation are fiction.\n<blockquote>Weird, though, that you would therefore apparently seem to regard Call of Cthulhu or Vampire: the Masquerade as closer to being a Forge game than to being a trad RPG. Very weird.</blockquote>\nVampire and Call of Cthulhu are more like Sorcerer, Don't Rest Your Head and tremulus than they are like GURPS, BESM, Universalis, or Primetime Adventures. GURPS, BESM, Universalis and Primetime Adventures are more like each other than they are like Vampire or Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Forge games are just (for the most part) regular RPGs.  Nobody can ever prove differently because "regular RPGs" was always such a gigantically diverse category by the time the Forge came along. (PS play was even more diverse than texts, so the same principle applies to that).<br/><br/>(Every so often a really weird "near-RPG" one comes across like Penny For My Thoughts, but it's VERY rare, and happens just as much outside Forge thought and before the Forge came along, so they can't really be said to be "Forge games".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17943/friday-topic-fiction-oriented-gaming" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17943/friday-topic-fiction-oriented-gaming" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17943/friday-topic-fiction-oriented-gaming/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17943%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17943%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
