That means that the discounted price of $29.95 will also be ending. When the softcover ships, the regular price of $32.95 goes into effect.

I'm not familiar with the original though Brett - how do they compare? What's different between them? And do you have any actual play posts using either the new or the old versions? I'm sure folks around here would be interested in seeing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brettmb" title="brettmb"><img alt="brettmb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brettmb">brettmb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89163/#Comment_89163" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T11:50:45+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 11:50AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After taking control of the project, I organized the Revised version in a more intuitive fashion, including an easier to follow layout. We also added a history of the pulps as well as some new material, while cleaning up the writing. The new cover by Jeremy McHugh also complements his interior artwork from the original, and we used some other, terrific pulp art.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the thing about the games I publish is that they typically reach the casual, lapsed, and "no time to talk" gamers (this includes the college professors using Coyote Trail in the classrooms). Two-Fisted Tales is actually a departure from the other games as it is more involved (the other games are intended as pick-up and diversionary games, and for those with short attention spans). Because of this, they are busy playing rather than recording their activities or spending much time on the web, so actual play accounts are far and few between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89639/#Comment_89639" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T01:27:23+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  1:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: brettmb</cite>Because of this, they are busy playing rather than recording their activities or spending much time on the web, so actual play accounts are far and few between.</blockquote>\nThat's a shame - I'd love to hear how Coyote Trail gets used in classrooms!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
