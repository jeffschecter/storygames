                    A French LARPer friend of mine tells me that they use actual practical puzzles in their LARPs. <br/>
<br/>
For example, when you want to pick a lock, they make you solve one of those wire puzzle things, where you have to disentangle two shaped wires from each other. To crack a safe, you solve a sliding block puzzle. To find a file, you solve an anagram.<br/>
<br/>
I like this. And I think it might solve a problem I have in my Meat Loaf game. At the moment, to repair or modify a bike, you have to wait for 2 minutes by the bike. It's dull. Instead, I could give them sliding block puzzles (or similar). Solve the puzzle and you've repaired the bike.<br/>
<br/>
Does this sound interesting? Do any other games work like this? Any potential pitfalls?<br/>
<br/>

                            The main pitfall is that you're then counting on the mental acuity of the player instead of the character.  If my character is a safecracker, but I can't figure out the wire puzzle, then that's a problem.  Other than that, it sounds like it'd be a great idea.

                            Just a thought about the bike thing. What if you bought a pack of big nuts &amp; bolts (like <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.screwfix.com/app/sfd/cat/pro.jsp?cId=101810&amp;ts=13914&amp;id=83569" rel="nofollow">these</a>, or from B&amp;Q or something), and put ten or so around each bike (maybe in a bag, so bits don't get lost and that it wasn't easy to tell the state of the bike from just a quick look).<br/>
<br/>
If somebody wants to sabotage the bike they have to undo all ten bolts. And to repair it, you have to tighten them all up again. Before each race, a GM checks the bag and sees how many are loose to determine if the bike is damaged?<br/>
<br/>
Not really a puzzle, but it's something to do whilst/instead of waiting.                        </div>

                            When I ran Super Console at a convention, I used Jenga, a small jigsaw puzzle, a game of Set, and good ol' Towers of Hanoi (via baby stacking cups) to simulate in-game puzzles. The advantage there is that, in a console RPG, it <i>is</i> the player's intelligence you're testing with your puzzles.<br><br>Isbo's idea about scaling by difficult is a good one, though sometimes people have greater skills with different types of puzzle. I could see an old Masquerade game (with the chunky skills and RPS resolution) allowing you to choose which puzzle you wanted to do if you tied the shoot, and choosing the easier one if you won. This means you need a large selection of puzzles, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.                        </br></br></div>

                            I love the bolts-in-a-bag idea.  There are lots of variations on this theme, but the idea of having an activity that will take an average dude the amount of time you want (two minutes in this case) but that can be done faster or slower, is way more fun than standing there.  Personally I'd provide bolts of varying sizes, or require a certain number of washers on each pair, etc.                        </div>

                            I like the bag of bolts idea.<br>
<br>
Here's a variation:<br/>
<br/>
There are ten bolts and nuts in the bag, with numbers 1-10 painted on them..  When people get things to install on their bike, they get washers to thread on the bolts, to represent those installations.  The washers have particular places they need to be installed, and are painted colors.  Everything has to be tightened finger-tight or the bike won't work right.  <br/>
<br/>
Judges keep a book of the rules about what is installed where.  When you run a race, a judge compares the bolts in the bag to his list of legal configurations, and applies bonuses and penalties to the race based on the state of the bolts and washers.  If you can slip a piece of paper between bolt and nut, then the bolt is not tight.                        </br></br></div>

                            I really like the bag o' bolts. It ties in nicely with the tactile and the time of the in-game actions.<br/><br/>You might also want to tie the bag to the bike (what represents a bike? A real motorcycle?) to prevent people from wandering off with it. I also love the image of maybe several people slowly tinkering with the bag: Alice changes one bolt, then runs off; Bob saunters along next, changes a second blot, and gives the go-ahead to Eve, etc.<br/><br/>I think you might want to color-code the nuts and bolts instead of painting numbers. Simply moving the yellow nut to the red washer is enough to give penalties to the yellow and the red stats, and it doesn't take much time to see where something's amiss.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            Is it wrong to want the bag of bolts to be slathered in grease so that the mechanics quickly acquire a patina of black?<br/>
<br/>
Couldn't hurt to have a strip of aluminum with holes in it bolt the washers to.<br/>
<br/>
And if you wanted to get back into the puzzle realm, you could have a set of rules that describe a baseline bike and bonuses and penalties for certain modifications.    Then give certain subsets of the rules to characters who are good at fixing/breaking bikes.  Anyone can monkey with the bolts and hope it has some effect, but the better you know how it works the better you can expect to effect the bike.                        </div>

Certain people will be good at somethings, and not others.  <br/><br/>It means your characters tend to be more tightly bound to what you yourself can feasibly portray, but on the up-side the rules system <i>can</i> (if you wish)  be made to be much less intrusive.  <br/><br/>One system I play in uses WYSIWYG rules to a large extent.  By default, its understood that no rule is necessary to interract with something / someone.  <br/><br/>You want to persuade someone to your cause?  Ok, go ahead and convince them.  But you're not very good at verbal commmunication as a player?  Maybe you'd be better off trying something else, cos their ain't any "social interraction" rules.  <br/><br/>You want to decode the secret message?  Go ahead and decode it for real, there is no "crack code" skill.  You personally don't know how to decode codes?  Learning how is your only option.  <br/><br/>You want to be the best warrior in the world?  Take fencing lessons or kendo or something, because there is no "skilled warrior" trait, and yes there are players out there who are olympic fencers, and yes they will hand you your ass.<br/><br/>Lots of Table Top roleplayers find this difficult to deal with, as they are not used to the idea that certain character concepts may not work, simply because they themselves cannot feasibly pull it off.<br/><br/>I don't think this kind of thing is appropriate in all LARP games, but using challenges to the player rather than the character can be very fun in my experience.  It depends on context I guess.  <br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

                            Lots of LARP games involve real-world skill.  In SOLAR, if you want to be a good spellcaster, you need to have a good throwing arm, and if you want to be a good fighter you need to be agile.                        </div>

That's a fair point. Yes, the things I'll use it for won't be things that'll break the game if they fail.<br/><br/>I still like the nuts and bolts and I'll go with them.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            These are some neat ideas.<br/><br/>And, of course, if you've got a pre-designed plot (which makes me grimace even to type it) don't put anything there that will keep the plot from going through.<br/><br/>(PS: What's the point of playing through if you know the plot will happen anyway? I leave that as an exercise to the reader. Hint: it's a trick question. Hint: OK, here's the answer: I think it's a dumb way to structure games.)                        </div>

                            Hmm. What's the point of re-reading a novel where you already know the plot, having read it before?<br/>

                            Yeah, Joshua, I'm calling you out on that one.  Knowing the ending is just one parameter.  How you arrive there may be unique and compelling time after time.                        </div>
