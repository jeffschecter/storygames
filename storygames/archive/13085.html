If you are a game designer, there is much to absorb and enjoy.<br/><br/>I love the way special actions are handled - there's a single monolithic deck of cool things characters can do, and everyone chooses from that deck. This meant that my badass dwarf would be the only guy biting people's ears off, because I took the "get personal and smash them in the face" card whose name I forget. Built-in niche and color protection.<br/><br/>I love the notion of stances - you can be aggressive or conservative, and this is reflected in the duality of many components - the above-mentioned cards have red sides and green sides, with varying effects based on your stance. Your dice pool is not-so-subtly impacted by stance as well, which is really cool.<br/><br/>Although it didn't get any play in our first session, I really like the idea of a party sheet - we're "swords for hire", we get a special custom move, and we can attach talents (or something) to the card for community use. And of course we suffer stress as a group. It's a very clever way to reinforce teamwork.<br/><br/>I was really skeptical about the array of funny dice, but in play it gets really interesting, and seems to be well thought out. More play will tell, but so far it is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Have you played? What interesting mechanics and emergent properties have you observed? What works and what doesn't? Anybody playing this in a long-term way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294892/#Comment_294892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T07:54:20+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  7:54AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It got a lot of smack similar to D&amp;D 4E when it came out ("It's a boardgame!" "2nd edition is perfectly fine!" etc.). I was really intrigued by it and I really liked everything they have shown, but I have to admit the high price tag was what put me off. It's around 90euro in my LGS (which is something like 120$) and the postage for shipping the big box is atrocious.<br/><br/>For I while I was really seriously considering buying it anyway, but the various threads on the game convinced me not to do it. The main complaints seem to be the large amounts of fiddly bits (cards, tokens, sheets) which can be easily lost and are hard to replace (not to mention that there is only a limited number of them in the original game and you have to buy the expansion set if you want more players etc. - same goes for the custom dice which would be a pain in the ass to replace, and they're pricy if you want each player to have his own set. I know you can make them yourself, but eh.<br/><br/>I know the book was also criticized for lacking an index (I think) and being poorly organized. There were some other complaints, but nothing significant I guess.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it seems like a very cool game by all accounts. I would like to play it, but we've got a ton of games going on anyway, and it seems like the kind of deal that would require a lot of investment from everyone (and if it turns out we wouldn't like it, it would be a real pain to our wallets (by comparison, I can get almost six complete indie games for the same price, or 12+ if we're talking pdfs)).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294894/#Comment_294894" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T08:04:00+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  8:04AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of our Janus people tried it (among them Luca and Flavio) for several sessions.

The game suffers from typical Fantasy Flight over-production: too many bits to fiddle with, too many rules that don't add much to the game, etc. However, once we finally figured out the rules, things ran relatively smoothly.<br/><br/>That being said, I feel like there's a really good game hidden inside WFRP, the dice mechanic being the core of it. Remove the cards, remove the specific effects, even remove some of the types of dice (you really only need stat, challenge, fortune, and misfortune for the system to work). In the end you have this really neat narrative mechanic that produces not only success or failure, but also independently produces strokes of good or bad luck. Further change it such that the rolls were conflict resolution, rather than task resolution, and the game would flow much more quickly, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294941/#Comment_294941" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T11:08:08+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 11:08AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played it twice a while back and liked it well enough.

I'm actually going to be a guest on Trapcast Jenn's Jennisodes along with her and the rest of my group to talk about the game, so I have definitely been thinking about this game a lot. Here are some of my thoughts.<br><br>The Dice Mechanic is fantastic. The way that a success can also have unintended side-effects in a real and mechanical way is beautiful and wonderfully handles the themes of humor and violence of WF fiction. <br><br>I really liked the "before and after" in-the-moment rewards. If a player narrates some cool things when setting up his action, the GM gives him some extra dice. If the player desribes a cool outcome for his dice roll, the GM gives the group some fortune points.<br><br>This game has by far the most involving and fun combat that I've ever played. The way the action cards can easily add to or change the environment is bad ass. The wound cards are tactile and fun. <br><br>Niche protection like a son of a bitch.  Every card is a statement. "This is how my dude is awesome." <br><br>The game takes a lot of work from the GM to be interresting outside of combat. It's not that the game stops working outside of combat, it's just that it doesn't have the traction that it has in combat. That's really where bringing in those tracking tokens and building a meter comes in handy.<br><br>The presentation of some aspects of the game, especially advancement, is handled poorly. <br><br>The Play Advice doesn't really appeal to me but I also think that in parts it actually doesn't supply good advice for playing the game. The tension meter on the Party Sheet is a wondeful tool once I let my players control it. They were the sole arbiters of the meter moving and it really became a great way to track the way the party feels from scene to scene. The book suggests using the tension meter to slap wandering or argumentative players back in to line by punishing the entire party. So, so wrong headed.<br><br/>More ideas are on their way. I'm playing hookey from work to comment here.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294982/#Comment_294982" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T12:40:27+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 12:40PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a GM, I fucking loved putting delay tokens on people's basic actions.<br/><br/>Almost as much as I love the orc attack where he kills goblins and snotlings along the way for bonuses to cutting down his opponent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294989/#Comment_294989" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:06:44+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:06PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I know you're mostly looking for positive stuff, but as a GM (in the game Walton mentioned) I actually felt pretty let down by all those rules.

I've been having a great time - far more roleplaying is being seen, less prep time on my part.<br/>\n<br/>\nSession reports are here:<br/>\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=165&amp;efcid=3&amp;efidt=353613<br/>\nand<br/>\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=165&amp;efcid=3&amp;efidt=353836<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the game does support more than 3 players.  The original box has materials for 3 + GM but rules are not so limited.  An "adventurer's toolkit" adds materials for a 4th Player (or 5th if you buy 2).  Of course certain "not respectful of IP" processes would do that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad:  yes rules are badly organized and the electronic pdf version is heavily layered and so slow loading (but you can cut and paste into a wordprocessor and organize to your heart's content).  Company is coming out with hardback editions of rules with more explanations and that's pretty much a direct response to widespread trashing of their initial organization (the company has actually gone to trouble of splitting upcoming hardbacks into "just the current rules better organized, you don't have to buy if you're happy with them" and "these ones have new rules and stuff in them").<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not as bad as it might be since what players need to know is mostly on cards facing them.  I gave players a summary of character creation process and other than that none of them have rules or have needed to know them.  I'm the only one who has the full ruleset and none of them have needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers have made points about cool dice mechanic etc.  I like the way "board game concepts" have been used for great effect on table top.  You like long table of critical wounds - instead of rolling, here's a deck of cards, instead of writing down the wound's effect, just take the card and put it by your character sheeet.  Ditto table of magical miscasts, table of temporary or not-so-temporary mental aberrations, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is like an "orrery" of many moving parts bewildering at first but becomes intuitive and is indeed handy for GM to use to reflect different things or player to suggest "hey can I do this if I spend fatigue or take a misfortune die on roll".<br/>\n<br/>\nI find the actual chits that come with game for tracking not visually distinct enough for my taste (what can I say my group has been gaming 25 years since university, we''re entering our bi-focal years) so have replaced them with coloured "gaming stones".<br/>\n<br/>\nI too like the "every character unique" aspect of character creation (it doesn't have to be played that way but that's essentially the default approach, if you take the "Winning Smile" action, then you're the only PC with a "Winning Smile").<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been running converted earlier edition games or prepped scenarioes treating them as sandboxes so far but the "handling ease" on GM side is making me very comfortable to eventually just let it go wherever players want.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294993/#Comment_294993" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:20:54+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:20PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My NJ group has been playing a few sessions, and we're having a great time.<br/><br/>I dissagree that the rolling is slow. I feel like you get into a groove of understanding with it. Figuing out what has happened based on what your dice say is a pretty rich element. I like the sooth-saying feel of it. <br/><br/>There's some form factor things that i don't love, but i'll stay positive. <br/><br/>We're playing adventures right out of the box.

We just did two players + GM, and all the fights went smoothly.  We ended up racking up a lot of insanities, which I wasn't really expecting.  <br/><br/>As Jason mentioned, the group identity/card with a special power socket was a really cool innovation.  Probably my favorite element.  Having a way to directly share some of your special powers with other group members opens up some nice options. (We're sneaking in, I'll swap my "extra fortune die on all Stealth rolls" into the group spot.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a lot of the social powers were incoherent.  They had references to something like a compel that we could find anywhere in the rules, during or after the game.  The out-of-combat rules over all were equally incoherent.  Some buffs are clearly only useful out of combat, and intended to last some duration marked by delay tokens.  But the rules for how these delay tokens went away out of combat weren't even a little bit clear.  Any of the logical interpretations made some powers (esp healing) waay to good and other powers pointless, or vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295040/#Comment_295040" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T16:25:48+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  4:25PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Kevin or Eppy, I want you to run this for me one day!</blockquote>\nI'd love to make that happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295041/#Comment_295041" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T16:34:04+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  4:34PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Invite me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295044/#Comment_295044" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T16:55:57+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  4:55PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately I've not been able to get more than a session or two played with a pick up group at YOFLGS.  Even more unfortunately they were run by a dedicated WHF2 GM who was quite vocal in his expectation that he wouldn't like 3E and would be going back to 2E as soon as he proved that 3E sucked to his players who wanted to try it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I was able to glean a few things I really really loved.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the dice are the awesome.  I'd totally love to run all kinds of crazy sword opera or pulp adventure hacks with just the dice.  An index card with a cheat sheet for what the symbols mean on one side (the interpretive meaning not the "spend to activate power" meaning) on one side and a brief hack of rules for how to build a die pool on the other for each player and you could literally play a pick up game in any setting you want with just those index cards and a bag of dice.  Maximum Droolage.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) the cards i initially thought were worrisome (from the fiddly perspective) then I liked them because they helped organize things without having to scrawl lots of details on a character sheet, then I really fell in love with them.  Not from play but from collecting and reading them.  In many ways the cards serve a similar function to the Life Path entries of Burning Wheel...except you're custom creating your own path from the cards you chose ad hoc.  But each one of those cards...like a life path entry...is a little nugget of pure setting gold.  From the title on the card to the type of effects it has.  Its not just a power...its a statement, "in this world this kind of thing happens...often enough we put it on a card".  And when you take that card and attach it to your character you're saying "yeah...this kind of thing happens...and its people like me that do it..."<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the cards start to make alot more sense once you pick up the expansions.  Not that the expansions are necessary, but I really didn't grok how they all interacted with each other until I'd seen enough cards to say "oh...I get it...basic actions over there these actions over here, the different categories..cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the rest of the bits and tokens and progress tracks and such I didn't get to see used in valid play.  But I'd really really really love to try this game with a group of people that were both totally into story game play and totally into groking and enjoying dancing with mechanics, because I think there's a ton of using the the mechanics to enhance play that can go on here with the right combination of interest and skill set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295054/#Comment_295054" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T17:48:34+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  5:48PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoyed playing it.

I can squint at it and see a fun game, though. Bring in some GM techniques you've honed elsewhere and it should be good to go.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295068/#Comment_295068" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T18:55:51+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  6:55PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran it a few times. Really enjoyed the dice pool mechanics, especially interpreting the symbols on the dice into the table narrative. The crew I played with got a huge kick out of this, coming up with some fantastic descriptions that were led suggested by the die results.<br><br>I like the cards and the bits - not intimidated or slowed by them at all. The party sheets are cool and help focus the group.<br><br>I'm into other things at the moment, but I would pick this up again when I have the chance.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295153/#Comment_295153" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T07:53:06+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  7:53AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Invite me!</blockquote>\nYou got it. <br><br><br>Now I just have to find a way to get my ass and that brick of a box set back to New York.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>...my character seemed badass and fragile at the same time.</blockquote>\nYes!
