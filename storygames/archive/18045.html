Maybe not a question exactly, but more just wondering about something. On the 7-9 result, a player has the option to choose something from the 10 up list but gain the Condition <i>terrified</i>. Is that always the appropriate Condition though?<br/><br/>I mean, in scary situations yes. <i>Terrified</i> is the perfect Condition. But it seems to me as if the <i>hold steady</i> move is similar to <i>AW</i>'s <i>act under fire</i>, or <i>DW</i>'s <i>defy danger</i>. Meaning that <i>hold steady</i> is the "go to" move when the fiction needs to be resolved with a move, but none of the other moves are appropriate.<br/><br/>For example, on page 154 of the book, in <i>The Long Example</i> chapter, one of the characters has to <i>hold steady</i> when attempting to swipe a bottle out of another character's hands. They get a 7 on their roll, grab the bottle with no ill effects, and play continues. But what if the player had chosen to take a 10 up option? The situation didn't seem to be all that terrifying, just tense.<br/><br/>Of course the answer is simply "Give out whatever Condition seems appropriate for the situation." I'm just curious what other Conditions MCs have handed out as a result of <i>hold steady</i> moves.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407554/#Comment_407554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T02:06:03+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  2:06AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in what others do, too- this is one of the problems I have with Hold Steady.

But I understand what you mean. Some of the other moves generate fiction regardless of their outcome.<br/><br/>Can you elaborate a bit, <a href="/forums/profile/Praion">@Praion</a>? If you don't use <i>hold steady</i> like <i>defy danger</i> or <i>act under fire</i>, then how do you use it? Only when the character attempts to do something when fear would possibly hold them back?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that <i>hold steady</i> is identical to it's sister moves from <i>Apocalypse World</i> or <i>Dungeon World</i>. I'm much more inclined to just let things happen in <i>Monsterhearts</i>, provided the action makes fictional sense. But there are times when I feel actions shouldn't be resolved simply with player or MC narration. Like there was a part in our last session that chafed me a bit.\n<blockquote>Cage is lying on the bed when January comes out again. She pauses, then throws the wadded up clothes at his head and jumps on him. Pinning his wrists down. Knees on either side of his hips. She leans down towards his face, and that\u2019s when Cage sees her change. Just for a split second. Her eyes go completely black and her twists up into horns. Exactly the way Vivian had told him she looked when January was in the car with Lance before. Somehow Cage flips January. He\u2019s on top of her now. Pinning her down.</blockquote>\nCage flipping January over was simply narrated by the other player and honestly I felt a little cheated as January's player. I started to complain, but then just let it go. I didn't want to be that guy. But I feel that something more was needed to represent that Cage's player didn't have complete control of the situation. There was another player character directly at odds with what he was attempting to do.<br/><br/>Just got me thinking about whether <i>hold steady</i> should apply in more situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407632/#Comment_407632" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T18:39:33+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  6:39PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hyvemynd">@Hyvemynd</a>, I agree with you, and the use of "hold steady" in the Long Example in the book appears to be exactly as you describe: it's not quite like "act under fire", but it is used in an uncertain situation to add some uncertainty to the way things are going.<br/><br/>I haven't run into it yet, but I think I wouldn't hesitate to give a Condition other than "terrified", if it was appropriate. I don't think that's an unwelcome change to the rules: Conditions are mechanically interchangeable, after all. I think "terrified" is just a default in this case.<br/><br/>As for the "nothing happens" 7-9 option, I've been wondering about that too, over in the "writing Monsterhearts" thread. It seems like a weird bit of design which I'm not sure how to harness at the table.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407779/#Comment_407779" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T05:43:05+00:00" title="March  2, 2013  5:43AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/HyveMind">@HyveMind</a> i think the question in hold steady is different then in AuF. <br/><br/>AuF is, can i do this without something bad happening to me.<br/>Hold Steady is, can i keep it together while bad things are happening. <br/><br/>It's much more internal.

Its less about the thing you're accomplishing (if indeed you're accomplishing a thing) and more about how fucking uncontrollable your emotions are in the face of holy-crap-wtf-I-don't-even?! <br/><br/>Additionally, whenever someone takes the "you keep your cool" version, I embrace my whole "make them feel unaccepted" vibe and call them out for being too chicken to really find out what's going on, hiding I'm themselves rather than facing the truth, whatever, because what's really there would terrify them if they'd only ask (take <i>terrified</i> to ask a question). After all, they're looking to me to find out what happens and that's when I make my move, right.
