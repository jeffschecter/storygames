I should start by saying that I am about to recommend a course of action that strikes me as totally self-evident and obvious, but I have encountered enough people that don't do it that maybe it isn't. So, if you read this and say "Duh.", you are probably not the target audience.<br/><br/>I sometimes find myself on one forum or another wanting to point out a game (maybe yours) to someone else. I prefer to do this like so, for example:\n<blockquote>From your earlier comments, it seems like <a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/lacuna/" rel="nofollow">Lacuna</a> might be the game you are looking for.</blockquote>\nHyperlinking in action, where the reader can just click to go see what the hell I am talking about. Doing this, however, requires something very specific from a game publisher: <b>a page about the specific product I am mentioning</b>. Not a general site, not a blog about the game, not a review someplace, not a wikipedia page. <i>A single page dedicated to the product</i>.<br/><br/>In particular, this page should:\n<ul>\n<li>Instantly identify the specific game. The user shouldn't have to search around the page for the game I mean. It should be right in their face. See how that link above does this? No extra BS, just that one exact game.</li>\n<li>Instantly pitch the game. You just captured their eyeballs. Now, sell. See that link's immediate pitch? It does this well, too.</li>\n<li>Give the user a clear path to get the product. I made the recommendation, you made the pitch, they want the game. You've got them! Now make it easy for them to follow through and give you money. See how the link above... totally fails to do this?</li>\n</ul>\nNow, consider a different example. Say I want to post about a <i>Savage Worlds</i> supplement. Some of these, like <a href="http://www.muthaoithcreations.com/lowlife.html" rel="nofollow">Low Life</a>, have their own author-created pages, but many don't. In fact, <a href="http://www.peginc.com/games.html#SavageWorlds" rel="nofollow">Savage Worlds</a> doesn't even have a page of its own, just some dumb targets within one large page of all Pinnacle games. (This is actually an improvement from the last time I looked at Pinnacle's site, when it didn't even have these targets, just a big wall of scrolling text.) You can tell that Pinnacle approached their web site from a "here is how we want to present our product lines as a whole to someone who visits our home page" point of view. This is a "top down" type of approach, which can often seem like What You Do for a web site. But when I recommend a game in some forum by linking it, I want to send the reader on a "bottom up" tour, entering the site at the level of the specific. The experience from this direction is, in my opinion, more important to making a sale. With so much of small press working by word of mouth, I'd guess that the number of "top down" customers is dwarfed by "bottom up" recommendations, but maybe someone with real numbers could tell me different. In any case, even in a top down design, there is really no excuse for making the bottom up experience suck.<br/><br/>If you are using blog software as your web presence, don't just provide a category tag and call it a day. I never link to such things, because the contents change. That is, if I post a link to your game, I want that link to mean "here is where you can discover and get that game" not "here is place that has the latest five posts about that game". If using WordPress, the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages" rel="nofollow">pages feature</a> can be put to good use making dedicated product pages.<br/><br/>Lastly, please do what you can to make sure I can actually find your dedicated product page. I'm willing to crawl around a bit to find it, but it needs to be there to find. If I google "Your Game rpg" and, after a couple of pages of results, the best thing I can find to summarize your product is its entry on RPG Geek or a Wikipedia page or a product page on IPR, I could use a bit more marketing help from you.<br/><br/>Thanks for listening.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331201/#Comment_331201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-22T11:49:09+00:00" title="June 22, 2011 11:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2011 11:53AM by Wordman.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, if you are the type of person who recommends products to people in forum entries or blog posts, pretty please with sugar on top, add a f%$#ing link to the product. An angel goes to heaven when you, who already know what you are trying to find, search Google <i>once</i> to find the link and share it, instead of some vague mention of it that generates hundreds of Google searches (one for each reader) for the same thing.<br/><br/>Also, make the content of the link the name of the product. Such as the <a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/lacuna/" rel="nofollow">Lacuna</a> link, above. This helps tell Google to return that link when someone searches for "Lacuna".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331226/#Comment_331226" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-22T14:20:11+00:00" title="June 22, 2011  2:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is sound advice.<br/><br/>Can I add one of my own?<br/><br/>If you write a hack and put it up in PDF put a website and your name on the hack so I can credit you and link to easily.
