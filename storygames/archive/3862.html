FATE is so welcoming to conversion that I kept brainstorming ideas, which then convinced me that the basic concept of conversion is sound.<br/><br/><b>Burning Wheel Revised</b><br/>I kind of bought BWc on a lark having heard some buzz on RPG.net and browsing Luke's site, but managed to not read it. The revision came out soon after, so I bought that and actually read it. Besides rocking my world, BWr was the game that got me looking at the Forge and small press in general. My attitude towards RPG'ing has never been the same, and I am very grateful.

My regret here is that I haven't played more of it.</blockquote>\nHey Mike,<br/><br/>As one of the people that said early on that Shock was incomplete, I want to make sure it's clear that it's the <i>text</i> that I found incomplete. The game itself is awesome and ingenious. My group had a wonderful time playing it, and it did what it set out to do. We just needed to get the low-down from Joshua first. It's absolutely no surprise to me that you've had a blast with it.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to Shock v1.1.<br/><br/>To answer the question of the thread:<br/><br/>There are a lot of games that I'm really glad I bought. Burning Wheel Classic is the out and out winner since it was through that purchase that I met many of my best friends. Excluding BWC though, if I really get down to it, I'd say the top three are Rune, The Dying Earth and Hero Wars/HeroQuest. Aria: Canticle of the Monomyth gets an honorable mention.<br/><br/>Of those three, I've only really played HeroQuest a great deal. But I place the other two above it in importance.<br/><br/>In 2001, when Rune and The Dying Earth RPG came out, I'd already stumbled onto the Forge -- following the trail from the Gaming Outpost -- and was feeling my way around as a lurker. But it was when I picked up Rune that everything sort of clicked for me. It was an example of highly focused, extremely deliberate game design. And it was ironically that most gamist-supporting design that helped me to get a perspective of what the Forge guys were talking about.<br/><br/>Rune took all that stuff that I thought I wanted to get rid of in my gaming, put it in a new context with defined parameters, and made it seem like it would be really fun! I'm still eager to give it a spin. I'll get the Thursday night group on it one of these days.<br/><br/>I picked up The Dying Earth RPG a short while after Rune. Man, it really spun my head around! It was another highly focused, extremely deliberate game design, but <i>utterly</i> different than Rune; and the same guy designed it!<br/><br/>The Dying Earth had an <i>amazing</i> Persuasion system. It was an actual set of mechanics for the talky part of a role-playing game, and it looked incredibly fun and engaging! And just as much care -- if not more! -- had been put into the persuasion system as had been put into the combat system.<br/><br/>It became very clear to me while reading that game that what Robin was really doing with his designs was not shaping the game; it was shaping the experience of playing the game. That probably doesn't seem too earthshaking today, but to 2001-me it was mind blowing!<br/><br/>It was by exploring these two games in contrast that I really began to understand the possibilities of design.<br/><br/>HeroQuest is a different animal. Although I've had a lot of fun playing it, it doesn't have quite the hold over me as those two earlier games of Robin's. And that's simply because I was already pretty well steeped in a lot of the ideas from The Forge by the time I got my hands on it (not being fortunate enough to be an old RuneQuest hand/Gloranthaphile). I'd already explored Sorcerer, The Pool, InSpectres, Starchildren, Soap, Nicotine Girls, The Riddle of Steel, Burning Wheel and others by that point. I'd followed the creation of Orkworld.<br/><br/>So HeroQuest didn't give me an epiphany/perspective shift the way the other two did. But even with a few warts, that game is something else. Robin just stripped things down to their component parts. The way characters and conflicts are shaped and molded by the words on a character sheet rather than the numbers was really inspiring to me. <br/><br/>Aria gets an honorable mention from me. That book (and the companion, Aria Worlds), was hard to read, harder to use and nearly impossible to play (at least to me). But even so, I've found it very inspiring over the years. It made me want a functioning way to get the entire gaming group involved in creating a world to play in and shape the conflicts play would be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86791/#Comment_86791" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T19:28:19+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  7:28PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor, I had the exact same experience with Rune and Dying Earth.

It can be applied to many situations and tweaks with very little real work and every game I play of it reeks with cool, jazzed interplayer conflict that everyone walks away from with that positive "I played a cool game with my friends" vibe.  I love how the dice allow others to interact with the story.  I am jazzed about a possible "prettier" version and I plan on awsomifying the character sheet cause, Bill, it's damn bland. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>Burning Empires</b> - This is the stuff of SciFi Epics.  If you like cool rules.  If you like heavy story games with punch.  If you are awed by a book with 650 pages that's not how-this-fucked-up-monkey-race-raised-bees then this game is for you.  If your players don't care about the game behind the RPG or they are lazy bastards that do too little gaming away from the table (said with tongue firmly in cheek) then I suspect it will fail for you.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> - This game delivers.  Period.  It creates something that many story games do not - immersive conversation while dicing.  We did a short fantasy epic about Paladins and it still rocked.  This shit is Story Game gold in my book.<br/><br/><i>An honorable mention</i>: I am psyched about Russell's <b>Contract Work</b>.

It is so easy on a GM to just come up with the Pain of a thing and the rest of it is purely descriptive powers.  So much of the game is in the player's hands; a mix of role-play and some simple dice strategy.  Plus, the setting is evocative.

I no longer want to play the games my current group plays, especially in the <i> the way that group demands they be played</i>. They just don't interest me anymore. However I have nothing against the guys personally, its just I know longer want to sit in the room thinking there is something better than role-playing. When if that is what I have chosen to do that day there should not be (so please don't chirp in with the obvious list of better things to do).<br/><br/>Also as a last response to Jason.
