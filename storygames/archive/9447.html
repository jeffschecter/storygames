We attended (with little Prudence, her very first con!), and had a blast.  I did not run the IPR booth at Gamex this time around, which was sort of awesome.  It meant I had lots of time to just hang out, chat with friends, and play lots of games.  I barely noticed not having a 'home base' to fall back to.<br/><br/>Friday night we checked in and all that and then I settled down to play <a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/index.html" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a>, a structured freeform game which is getting a lot of play and buzz.  I went into it expecting it to be not-my-thing, and I came out of it knowing that it was not-my-thing.  Lack of strong character goals and a blindness to the parts of historical context that I really dig into were the big problems for me; I was also sort of an odd man out in our (randomly-generated) situation: everybody else was playing the sex-and-family bits of the situation, whereas I was the only one playing the religion part of the set.  Which all sounds more negative than it really is \u2014 everybody else was having a blast, and it's a nice little package of game-situation.<br/><br/>Saturday morning started off with <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/wicked.html" rel="nofollow">In a Wicked Age</a>, which Will calls, "The game I don't like that I have fun with every time."  Which is pretty spot-on accurate.  We played in God-Kings of War (best for cons) and ended with a giant naval battle determining the fate of an empire.  Schweet.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon I took the baby which Meghann had so kindly been entertaining while I was wicked-aging.  She went off to play a Star Wars game; I played <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34615" rel="nofollow">A New World: a Carcassonne game</a> with Prudence strapped to my chest.  The game is very neat and challengingly different than basic Carcassonne.  After that was done, we all (myself, Meg, Paul, Ryan, Jesse, Will, James, Morgan... who am I forgetting?) sat down to a luxurious two-hour-long dinner slot, which allowed us to have a lot of casual social time.  I really hope Strategicon retains the new schedule; I don't mind getting to the morning game an hour earlier if it means dinner isn't a big harried rush.<br/><br/>Saturday night I played in the <a href="http://www.housesoftheblooded.net/" rel="nofollow">Houses of the Blooded LARP</a>, which I went in expecting it to be not-my-thing and was totally blown away by the awesome.  John has devised a very, very slick conflict resolution system that is near-perfectly tuned to the LARP environment.  It incorporates mechanics directly into the roleplay in a nearly seamless fashion.  Yes, even combat \u2014 at the conclusion of the first (and only) duel of the night, John declared combat over and all the Vampire LARPers cheered because it was over so quickly and cleanly.  The "private scenes" which are played out in public give the whole experience a great sense of pacing and introduce tons of information into the game constantly.  Nobody walks around wondering where the action is \u2014 everybody walks around scheming on how to turn the action to their ends.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I had the baby again \u2014 I can't recall what Meghann was playing \u2014 and so played Thurn and Taxis again with baby in the <a href="http://www.sleepywrap.com/" rel="nofollow">sleepy wrap</a>.  I love that thing; I don't know how people raise babies without it.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon saw me running the Agora playtest/preview, which succeeded on both fronts admirably \u2014 I got some good playtest feedback and also introduced the game in an engaging and entertaining manner.  Thanks to Jesse, I even have an Actual Play recording of most of the game.  Playtest feedback mostly centered around "selling" player actions, and will result in a couple new (small) procedures and some chunky Mastery player advice.<br/><br/>Sunday evening, my parents trekked out to the convention just to take the baby off our hands for a timeslot.  While Meghann played <a href="http://archaiasp.com/mouse_guard_rpg.php" rel="nofollow">Mouse Guard</a>, I was able to just kick back with Ryan Macklin, who I don't get to see often enough, chatting about game design but also just things-and-stuff.  When they were done, Meghann returned spouting superlatives about Mouse Guard, so presumably there will be mice with capes and swords in our gaming future.<br/><br/>Monday morning I was literally the only RPG on the schedule, and so our game of <a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a> had six players.  We did a "Yes, and..." sort of series-building and came up with something truly spectacular.  Running in perpetual syndicated reruns on TVLand, our show was "Trouble in PERL-dice," a 60s-era sitcom-spoof (think F-Troop) about the Board of Directors of the international criminal organization PERL (pronounced 'peril').  As the show was ostensibly in reruns, we played one episode out of a "marathon," so started with the very end of one episode, including the "Next Time On..." segment.  This allowed us to have a Next Time On list for the episode we played, and this worked marvelously.  Our climax featured two flying aces in a dogfight using invisible planes \u2014 in other words, two guys in sitting position arcing and spinning around in the air.  Fantastic stuff.<br/><br/>And then it was time for post-con Mongolian BBQ with almost the whole gang (Paul and Ryan understandably  buggered off before then), completing a fantastic convention.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209327/#Comment_209327" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T18:36:52+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  6:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2009 6:37PM by ptevis.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mine is <a href="http://http://havegameswilltravel.net/index.php?post_id=484195" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but here's the quick hits version:\n<ul>\n<li>Kick-started the above-mentioned Montsegur 1244 game. Left before Act 2 to prep for Mouse Guard the next morning.</li>\n<li>Ran Mouse Guard with Ken, Michael, and Don. Discovered it to be quite possibly my favorite convention GMing game ever.</li>\n<li>Played New World, which I got in the Strategion Math Trade. Fun. Going to play more with Gwen.&gt;</li>\n<li>Played Android with Jesse, Ryan, and Will. Long. Figured out how to play roughly five turns into a twelve turn game. Would like to play again, but with people who don't dawdle. (Not that my companions did.)</li>\n<li>Played Thurn and Taxis. (Can you tell I hung out with Josh a lot?)</li>\n<li>Played Maneovre, a light, fairly-abstract Napoleonic battles game that's been sitting on my shelf for at least a year. Fun and quick (for a wargame).</li>\n<li>Ran Mouse Guard with Meghann, Will, and Scott. Was amazed by Will's command of the interrobang. "Weasels?!?" Awesome game.</li>\n<li>Wandered around Monday morning, had an all-to-brief but apparently productive conversation with John, and headed home to see my wife, missing the Mongolian BBQ.</li>\n</ul>\nOther notes:\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone seemed to like the change in venue, not simply because the hotel was nicer, but because the hotel staff actually seemed to care.</li>\n<li>The new 9A/2P/8P schedule (which I pressed on the new RPG head when he mentioned the RPGA was moving their evening game earlier) was fantastic. I was able to sleep more at the con because I could hang out with people at times other than midnight.</li>\n<li>There's apparently a burgeoning Story Games crowd in Las Vegas, several of whom came to the con to get a taste of the action. I'm considering going to NeonCon in November.</li>\n<li>Prudence is the best-behaved con attendee ever.</li>\n</ul>\n--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209358/#Comment_209358" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T05:47:13+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  5:47AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, I wanna see pics of you playing with the baby strapped to your chest.

I really enjoyed M1244 and I ordered it off IPR as soon as I got home from the con.  My primary character was Phillipa, as my primary, and Pierre as secondary.  It was interesting because they couldn't share scenes but were husband and wife.  In the end, Phillipa escaped into the night, not to avoid burning for heresy but because she had murdered Pierre.<br/><br/>Saturday morning had a Wicked age full of boats, betrayal and brothers.  Josh summed up my feelings on this game.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon I played Dirty Secrets with Jesse, Ryan, and some other people.  I played the investigator who while looking into the murder of a young girl uncovered a corrupt gang task force leaders plan to start a gang war for fun and profit.  Dirty secrets consistently delivers good games.  <br/><br/>Saturday night I played in the Android game with Paul, Jesse, and Ryan.  I had played Android once before and didn't enjoy it.  I was sick then so I decided to give it another chance.  I had a lot more fun this time.  But, I do think the game is twice as long as it needs to be.<br/><br/>Sunday morning* I played New World Carcasonne.  It's a nifty variation on a classic game, but the color doesn't quite mesh with the mechanics in one or two spots.  <br/><br/>Sunday afternoon I played Agora.  It's a very cool game with a lot going on.  Don't be scared off by its long form nature.  Give it a try.<br/><br/>Sunday night was Mouseguard.  Mice with capes and swords, how can you beat that?<br/><br/>Monday morning was PTA. I played a sane scientist who joined the evil PERL as a means to get funding for his research.  I spent the episode trying to impress Anna, the hot Swedish representative from the Nobel committee, and had the terrible things I built for PERL.  I only succeed in impressing here when I revealed the true nature of PERL and all the evil things I made.<br/><br/>Lastly, I went and ate some awesome Mongolian BBQ.<br/><br/>*It seems either Josh or I experienced time out of order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209403/#Comment_209403" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T11:59:33+00:00" title="May 28, 2009 11:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Friday night I was in the Montsegur 1244 game.  In fact, I had pre-registered for it and marked the first game I've pre-registered for at the con since... well since I was about 15.  I enjoyed it as well but I was not on my A game.  I made a lot of "safe" choices because without resolution mechanics I was afraid of running rough shod over the game.  I did enjoy it however and now that I have a better sense of the flow of things I would gladly play it again.<br/><br/>Saturday morning, I slept.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon I played Dirty Secrets with Ryan, Will and Ed.  I love this game.  I already knew the game had range but Will and Ryan showed me just how far that range really goes.  The two games I've played with them have had a very urban hard-hitting street corrupt cop feel to them which contrasts sharply with the games I had played previously having much slower more classic noir pacing.  The fact that the game can do either well is a testament to its strength.<br/><br/>Saturday evening as others have mentioned was the Android game.  This was my third play of the game.  This is a board game I love for reasons that are still unclear to me.  I'm normally bothered by high-colored board games because my RPG aesthetics tend to start overriding the priorities I should have for winning the game.  That doesn't happen when I play this game.  Don't get me wrong, I still came in last.  I consistently come in last by a margin of about 20 points.  Not sure what I"m doing wrong.  Although this game taught me that I really need to pay more attention to which detectives are in play and what they're good at.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I slept.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon I was supposed to be running One Can Have Her but didn't get enough people signed up so I played Agora instead.  The game isn't my style but it isn't a bad game.  In fact, from what I've seen it's Josh's best work so far.  It does however require some discipline in maintaining the fiction in a coherent manner.<br/><br/>Sunday evening I was supposed to be running Spione but again came up short of players.  So instead I sat near Paul's Mouse Guard game occasionally listening while reading Houses of the Blooded.  I continue my tumultuous love/hate affair with this game I will play it at some point.  I have to.<br/><br/>Late night Sunday well into the wee hours of Monday morning I had a long conversation with James about genre fiction and games which included some great discussion regarding my Silent Sound which has helped me get over a couple of hurdles I was stuck on.<br/><br/>Monday I slept.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209404/#Comment_209404" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T12:02:01+00:00" title="May 28, 2009 12:02PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>Played Android with Jesse, Ryan, and Will.
