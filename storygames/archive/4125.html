However, I'd like to take a moment to say something personal and positive about the community of gamers that we are part of.<br/><br/>As some of you might know, I'm currently in the first couple of months of a trip round the world, taking in the USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and other exciting places. I write this sitting in LAX airport waiting for my flight to Tokyo. The generosity and hospitality I have experienced during my time in the US and Canada has been wonderful. Not only people inviting me into their homes, but the offers of meals, sightseeing, local advice and (of course) games, has been a great thing to be part of. I'd like to thank the following:<br/><br/>Brian Marshall and his family in Georgia for inviting me into their home and treating me like a member of the family. I met Brian through GEAS, the roleplaying society at Edinburgh University and the opportunity to visit his hometown and play a game with his regular group was too good a chance to give up. Brians gaming group ceased their normal play for an evening and invited me to run Dust Devils. And boy was it fun.<br/><br/>Derek Robertson and Kat Urbaniak in Montreal. Expatriate friends from Edinburgh, I'd always promised to visit them after they moved to Canada. And I got the chance to play in their regular CoC game, taking on the role of a shady NPC journalist at the local games shop. Good times.<br/><br/>Joshua and Carrie Newman, who on the first night I arrived in Western Mass. cooked me a lovely meal of steak, mushrooms and freshly picked corn over charcoal in their front yard. Building stuff for Gen Con with Josh, hanging out with him and Carrie, refreshing ourselves in the local swimming hole, getting to see Meg Baker (and Vincent very briefly, but sadly not the kids as they were in bed) because she wouldn't have the chance to be at Gen Con, meeting Julia Ellingboe in person and so many more things. Plus the almost priapic levels of excitement induced by the arrival of Shock: 1.1 just before leaving for Gen Con.<br/><br/>The Bus Of Kryos to the Big Show. Everyone on that trip made it immense fun, despite the distance, tiredness and bad food! Special thanks must go to Judd and Jeff for their battling through fatigue to drive us all the way there.<br/><br/>Gen Con is a an entire huge post in itself.<br/><br/>The redoubtable Joe MacDonald in Vancouver, who gave me somewhere to crash, pointed me at good bits of the city and got his gaming buddies together in The Grind coffee shop for a great game of Shock: 1.1. Thanks also to Chad, Tyler and the rest of the Vancouver crew. If any of you are reading this: We have helped ourselves.<br/><br/>Paul Riddle in Seattle, whom I met through his girlfriend Shannon who was studying in Edinburgh. Paul gave me a place to stay, took me to PAX, plied me with beer and was a sparkling host all round. There's nothing quite like sitting in someones apartment in a strange town, drinking beer, talking nonsense and watching 'Army of Darkness' and knowing all the lines.<br/><br/>And finally (at last, the audience says) Chris Bennett, Chris Hanrahan and Brian Isikoff in San Francisco. I got to see the gaming mecca that is Endgame Oakland (and believe me, it is one of the finest gaming stores I have ever entered), play a rambunctious game of Best Friends with Chris B, Albert, Nancy and a gentleman who kindly showed me the way to the BART station but whose name I shamefacedly forget. I apologise. And last night I enjoy a truly sumptuous meal with Chris B and Brian in 'B', a very excellent bistro in Oakland, before which I got to talk gaming, distribtion, small press promotion and a whole bunch of other stuff with Chris H at Endgame.<br/><br/>Why n earth am I telling you all this? Because a lot of these people I had ever met before, but who extended the hand of generosity and hospitality purely because we are all part of the community of gamers. It is both pleasing and humbling that this happens and I can't thank everyone who gamed with me, gave advice, gave me a place to stay or anything else on this trip, enough. <br/><br/>So, that's my positive statement about gaming today. This is community spirit at its very best.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92537/#Comment_92537" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T00:01:57+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 12:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm, that's wonderful.<br/><br/>However!

I was really busy with my work. However, I had the chance to meet Malcolm a couple of times, and even being around an evening with many of his friends when he was saying farewell. <br/>I must say I regret hardly to have been so busy; not to have more time to share with all of them. They are a really cheerfull and refreshing community to meet with. I had a very nice time.<br/><br/>A conversation about gaming with Malcolm also help me a lot to feel myself part of this community, sharing the same kind of gaming experiences, problems, and feelings in many aspects related to this hobby.<br/><br/>I want to thank them, and I hope to meet them again in the future, in whatever circumstances arise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92547/#Comment_92547" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T05:26:20+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  5:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was great to have met you, Arturo. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>And Malcolm, hurry home. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Joe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92550/#Comment_92550" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T06:24:12+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  6:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm, yer the best!

It was great fun playing Contenders with you and Eric. For those who aren't me, Nathan or Eric, we had a fun few hours playing Contenders at Story Games Boston, setting the game in Depression Era dustbowl America, with boxing as the only hope for the impoverished, out of work inhabitants of a small town. Good fun. And drinking with the SG Boston guys afterwards was a wonderful way to round off the evening. And to cap it all, Nathan kindly gave me somewhere to crash for the night and bus directions for the morning.

First off, Andy K put me in touch with Cam Eeles in Tokyo, who was a totally stand up guy who took me for beers, nightclubs and good food. I'll hopefully be seeing Cam again in Tokyo before I fly out to NZ at the end of the month. And (although I've yet to meet him), Simon Carryer has very kindly offered to show me Sapporo and the surrounding area (and give me somewhere to sleep) when arrive there at the the end of this week.<br/><br/>And then there are all the New Zealand crew as well, who I'll get to meet in a few weeks. But most of all, my good friend Morgue in Wellington, who left Scottish shores for his homeland too long ago and I'm ridiculously excited to be seeing again.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
