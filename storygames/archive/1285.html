                    So there's my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1283" rel="nofollow">totally anecdotal survey thread</a> asking people who have bought one indie game about their purchases since.<br/><br/>So far on Story-Games, the response has been pretty plain.  I am considering copy-pasting the same survey on RPGnet and RPGsite for comparison purposes.<br/><br/>However, I am starting to think this is the thing to talk about regarding indie games and indie games' success.  It's not "indie games sales as compared to mainstream games in numbers of sales."  It's the (apparent) fact that it's a one-way door for a lot of people.  If the responses continue to go as they have gone so far (and if they are the same on other fora), it will strengthen my suspicion that indie games are not a small counter-entropic bubble in the vastly larger entropic system of mainstream gaming; indie gaming is (becoming) a different thing altogether.<br/><br/>Additionally, it simply <em>doesn't matter</em> if the rate of "conversion" is low as long as it's constant for any length of time.  If the rate of people going through the one-way door is less than the people getting into mainstream gaming, indie gaming is a parasite on the mainstream industry, at least in terms of sales.  If the rate through the one-way door is <em>greater</em> than the influx of new players to mainstream gaming, then indie gaming is a particularly deadly parasite over time.  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll have those numbers to compare any time soon, so the long-term effect of the one-way door will remain pure speculation.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Judging by mainstream publishers' reactions to indie publishing -- from the harsh disdain to the attempts to subsume indie games -- I think they may be seeing the same thing.</span> (Ignore that bit; talking out of my ass.)<br/><br/>I'd love to hear other's thoughts on the survey results as they develop.  Should this survey get ported elsewhere?  What patterns or significance do you see?                </div>

                            My guess is it's got nothing to do with "mainstream" vs "indie", and everything to do with people being filled with joy when they find a game that is laser-focused on producing a particular kind of story they enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure nobody's turning their nose up at "mainstream" games out of anti-corporation loathing (Eden is, what, two guys operating out of a FLGS?).<br/>
<br/>
So I doubt "indie" games will ever kill "mainstream" games, but if they kill a few publishers who don't think deeply about the mechanics of their games, that would probably be a good thing.                        </div>

                            I think there's multiple causes here:<br/><br/>1. Games designed with the philosophy that System Matters, and that a group shouldn't have to guess how to toolbox a game into doing something. (much like boardgames or card games are playable "as is", without requiring design work on the part of the play group).<br/><br/>2. Games designed for shorter play cycles- a single session of 2 hours up to a few months- quicker payoff, less commitment, more convenience.<br/><br/>3. Games that are quicker to learn and pick up.  (again, easier to get into)<br/><br/>4. Game texts &amp; a community that promotes functional social contract as the basis of fun play, as well as analysis and action, rather than "blame and try harder".<br/><br/>5. A community based on play, not collection.<br/><br/>6. Designers that listen to their customers, and also provide useful feedback and support.<br/><br/>Basically, games that aren't as much of a commitment of time or work, pay off reliably, and a functional social culture based around fun, not geek social fallacies.                        </div>

Only if you further speculate that once there's more indie gamers than mainstream the flow will reverse.  <br/><br/>Of course, once there are more indie gamers, it becomes the mainstream...                        </div>

<div class="Message">
                            At a local Con last weekend I met a guy who played two indie games -- InTERRORgation and Primetime Adventures. He had no idea such games existed. He had continued to buy games on and off for years, but not play them. My guess: he knew there was something like an RPG he would enjoy playing, but wasn't actually playing them.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he wanted to play again. He was pumping me for information about websites and where to get all these games. They answered a NEED.<br/>
<br/>
Same for me.<br/>
<br/>
And when I told a friend of mine (a fellow writer) about PtA, he immediately (I mean immediatley) went on line and starting Googling the game and bounced in and out of Actual Play threads and more. He called me and emailed me several times that night. Before I'd gone to bed he'd notified me that he'd sent out invitations to more local TV and Screenwriters he knew set up a PtA game for this Saturday. I mean -- it was like he'd heard about this thing called crack and simply had to arrange a buy.<br/>
<br/>
Now this guy used to write RPG stuff. He loves board games. And he's been hankering to play RPGs. But he simply never got around to doing it. Now, suddenly, in a six hour period, he was making it happen.<br/>
<br/>
The night before the local Con, I introduced this guy and a couple of his casual friends to Sorcerer. Again, everyone had played in the past, but hadn't played for a while. I didn't say anything to them aboout the dice rolling part.<br/>
<br/>
I said, "So, you'd be playing a character that is so driven to get something done, that he or she summoned SOMETHING from a place not human -- that gives your character powers to reach that goal. But your creature -- a Demon, but not the demons from hell, but demon in the sense that it is a creature that is un-human -- has Needs and Wants. By fulfilling these needs and wants -- and they're often nasty -- you get your demon to help you. Each of you will create a Kicker for your character. A Kicker is the situation that begins just as we begin actual play. It's the beginning of your character's Story, a moment of choice, with an open ended set of possibilities, that launch your character into the tale. I won't have an adventure for you to "figure out." We honestly Author a tale together. When the situation created by the Kicker is resolved one way or another, the adventure comes to an end."<br/>
<br/>
Okay, a couple of things:<br/>
<br/>
Each time I spoke the Captailized words in the paragraph above (or explained the word, like Kicker), their eyes lit up.<br/>
<br/>
Normally in a mainstream game people's eyes light up at the description of the Color and Setting. Note that here their eyes were lighting up at the rules introduction: because Needs, Wants, Kickers, Demons are all Rules components. I was giving them the basics of how to play Sorcerer. But unlike a mainstream RPG, this introduction wasn't about metaphors of Radio Drama or thinking through Stats of a character sheet. And they wanted to PLAY. Badly. (It was late; we were about to start Settlers of Catan, but we'll be doing that game NEXT Saturday.)<br/>
<br/>
This difference, to me, is key to understanding the One Way Door image Joshua came up with. For some of us, including the people mentioned in the examples above, whether the games are Indie or not doesn't matter. What matters is that they are delivering on the promise of what we always wanted to get from RPGs but couldn't get the rules to deliver.<br/>
<br/>
Some people who are used to mainstream games hear a description of Primetime Adventures or Heroquest or MLwM, or even Sorcerer (with it's Kickers and Bangs and lack of a "story" ready to go) and say, "But those aren't roleplaying games." (There was once a guy on the Forge who kept insisiting that the game of Sorcerer had no GM -- because the function of the Sorcerer GM was so alien to him he couldn't square the job description with his expectations.)<br/>
<br/>
Whether PtA or Sorcerer are or are not RPGs is not particularly interesting to me. What I find interesting is that the difference is so strong tha people try to disown them.<br/>
<br/>
Which I think is <i>fine</i>. Because it's that DISTINCTION that makes me want to play them. The same distinction that makes me not particularly care about mainstream games -- why I stopped buying and playing them and why I have no plans to buy the "D&amp;D is a metric" RPGs that most mainstream companies produce. (In this regard, the Pundit speaks to a large set of consumers and players. And I can only say, "Okay, whatevever, and I'll be playing the game that makes me happy over HERE, thanks.")<br/>

                            (second part)<br/>
<br/>
This last part is very important:<br/>
<br/>
I now have a possible four gaming groups on the table -- maybe more than I can even play -- up from NO ONE to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Or rather, I had people I could have asked. But didn't. Because I knew that the people I wanted to play an RPG with <i>wouldn't be satisfied with the game, just as I wasn't satisfied with the games.</i><br/>
<br/>
Now, suddenly, there are a ton of people to play with. Why? Because I've got games that the people I would want to play with would like!<br/>
<br/>
I don't have to indoctrinate new players into the arcane fun-logic of the D&amp;D mindset. ("No, no, Kabuki Theater really is fun once you understand it!")<br/>
<br/>
I described the basic components of Sorcerer to a group of people. They got it right off the bat because it sounded like a blunt dramatic situation (cause it is) like any TV show or movie they've ever seen, and they were revved to play. (And, again, that dramatic situation IS the rules -- it's not narrative color that might get buried during play.)<br/>
<br/>
That's really, <i>really</i> significant.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't have known who to ask to play and RPG in the past. Now I'm making plans with people to play the indie games left and right. Why? <i>Because the kind of games I'd like to play with the people I'd like to play with now exist.</i> (That last part in italics is kind of tricky, but it's really significant.)<br/>
<br/>
So, it's not just a matter of the door being one way for some of us. It's that <b>there's a door where there wasn't a door before</b> -- and people who might never have considered RPGs are going to walk through -- because these games are fundementally different than "mainstream" games. Not better -- different.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I have no idea if "most" players enjoy their RPG sessions or are mostly unhappy with them. I'll say this instead: Mainstream games are perfectly enjoyable for people who enjoy that sort of thing. And now I've got games that are perfectly enjoyable for <i>me</i> -- because I enjoy this sort of thing.<br/>

A question about the publisher comment.  So, who are you thinking of there?  Now, I don't talk to many pure publishers, but most of the major industry folk whom I talk to are extremely positive about indie games.  I'm thinking here of Mike Mearls, Ken Hite, Jonathan Tweet, and Robin Laws, for example.  So, there are a few like Malcolm Sheppard who are disdainful of indie games, but it's not like he's a major industry figure or anything, just a minor White Wolf freelance writer.  <br><br>At this point in the survey, I'm in the 10% or so minority (4 out of 20) who haven't reduced their mainstream RPG purchases.  It seems like about 2/3s have more-or-less quit mainstream purchases, while roughly 1/3 have reduced -- but it's an extremely small sample size.  <br><br>How you interpret it depends on your assumptions.  For example, Steve Jackson has generally said that more D&amp;D players is good for GURPS, because most GURPS players started as D&amp;D players.  Assuming that's true, they're a steady drain on D&amp;D, but it's not like WotC is worried or hostile about GURPS.  In general, I think that more diversity in games is good all around.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            What Christopher said.<br><br><i>Judging by mainstream publishers' reactions to indie publishing -- from the harsh disdain to the attempts to subsume indie games -- I think they may be seeing the same thing.</i><br><br>Um, this is totally not what I'm seeing.  Where are you seeing this, Joshua?  I'm seeing, over and over again, mainstream publishers (their hardcore fans are sometimes a different story) being really excited about indie games.  Kenneth Hite, Robin Laws, Steve Kenson, and a TON of other notables have said nice things about specific games or the indie gaming community in general.  White Wolf hired Jared Sorenson to write and publish what is basically an indie game INSIDE THE NEW VAMPIRE GAME MASTER'S GUIDE.  This fact still blows my mind. It didn't make a big splash in the indie community because none of us were willing to buy the book to get Jared's 20 pages.  We're also partially responsible for inspiring more than a handful of former mainstream freelancers to publish their own indie games (and not just d20 stuff too).  I'm totally not seeing the hate from mainstream publishers and game designers.  Some hardcore mainstream RPG fans, yes, but usually not people actually involved in making and publishing games.<br><br>EDIT: That Kim fellow beat me to it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua's observation about non-independent publisher reaction makes more sense to me with a little charitable reading-in on my part - if he's talking about <i>freelancers</i>, then yeah: the general reaction seems to be horror and fear, along with a lot of bizarre non-logical or non-factual claims, at least among a vocal subset (Malcolm Sheppard as mentioned, Bruce Baugh, et cetera). Mearls is a clear exception. I also agree with the objections to the non-charitable reading of hte statement listed already, and I'd like to add the names Ryan Dancey and Peter Adkison to those who've consistently and enthusiastically supported the Forge effort, at least.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend checking out <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9782.0" rel="nofollow">The Infamous Five</a></b>, a series of Forge threads which examined the concept of "mainstream" and game design. It seems to me that some of conclusions we reached there would help the discussion in this thread.<br/>

                            While it is desperately hurtful to my southpaw leanings, the big change is going to come when a game built with some of the mechanics developed in indies games makes a splash outside of the gamer market, when some real serious dough is made.<br><br>At that point, I'd imagine there will be some kind of type-name created and you'll see a huge push by all sorts of folks, rpg companies and plain old game makers, to jump on the band wagon.

                            Has anyone else notices how when people start getting into indie games, they stop buying game books just to read? When you played D&amp;D (if you're of that descent), how many game books did you buy knowing you'd probably never use them? How many books do you buy just to read now?<br>
<br>
I think that many people when they discover indie games change their expectations regarding what they can get out of gaming AND THEIR TIME. I suspect that this is because indie gaming turns you in the direction of play and design. Personally, I used to pour a huge amount of time and effort into building a new Warhammer army every year. Nowadays that seems cary to me because (as I posted in another thread), I can use that same time to design a game and get people playing it. Likewise, I used to spend a lot of time reading gaming books. I suspect that this is because the books (D20 I'm looking at you) actually delivered a better experience than play. Indie gaming has the potential to deliver an experience that's better than either. Going back just feels like a waste of time.<br>
<br>
And that's why indie gaming is a threat to mainstream gaming - it changes how you look at games. However, I suspect that the "mainstream" will learn from indie gaming and grow, rather than try to stamp out indie games. After all, most games are still written by people who like to play.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Well, why shouldn't freelancers dislike indie games?  There's no economic upside (generally speaking) for freelancing in the indie model, which relies on small game lines.                        </div>

                            A couple of thoughts about those "mainstream" guys from someone who, you know, works with them. <br><br>Jonathan has a very good point about how many of the companies actually view the Indie scene. Jared's section in the RCG was done pretty much exactly as he said -- to make Vampire Indie style. In fact, a large section of that book was set up to bring lots of different ideas into Vampire, including a lot specifically from our edge of the fringe. Ditto my section of Second Sight, White Wolf wanted me to write a section about making stories rather than listing powers, and I did as good a job of it as I could inside the time constraints. Many of the smaller companies I've worked with have been very, very happy to talk about putting those "wacky indie genius" ideas into games that they are doing. <br><br>What Ron says is also true, there are many big names in the mainstream who are all over the Indie scene and support it in a big way. There are even some places where you get mainstream publishers singing the praises of the Forge in print. Have many of you have seen the way the Forge gets love in Mongoose's Paranoia XP? <br><br>And now to the tricky part. Those "hostile" freelancers like Bruce and Malcom. I'm friends with Malcom IRL, and he and Mo went to school together. I know him a lot better, I feel, than those who only encounter him on line. I don't know Bruce that way, but I've talked with him online for years and have some sense of the man. And my general impression of both of them is not that they're against independent press games (both, in fact, have done work on such things) or that they're against expirementation and progress in RPG design. I think both of them are very much for those things. I just think they don't like the way we do it, and possibly more to the point, I think that at this point they just don't like us. We have a community that has a lot of joiner and clubby elements, and those who don't espouse the party line often have a rough go of it. So, as in any academy/archeology of knowledge situation, it is inevitable that we'll get fractures along personality and idealogical lines. It isn't as simple as "Malcom and Bruce are scared of change" because that's bullshit. <br><br>What Chris said above: "Mainstream games are perfectly enjoyable for people who enjoy that sort of thing. And now I've got games that are perfectly enjoyable for me -- because I enjoy this sort of thing" is a very true thing. And that statement there goes a long way to explaining both the mainstream publishers who keep publishing mainstream despite being big fans of the Forge, and of guys like Malcom and Bruce who do push their own ideas forward but do so in radically different ways than we do. The mainstream games still have players who play them (yes, play not just collect) and love them (yes love, not just think they like but are confused about their own emotions) -- and so there is still fun and money to be had  in publishing them. (For the nonce, at least.) There are also ways to go with game design and social setup that we don't get into heavily around here (just ask John), and there are people who are enjoying going in those directions even though it moves them increasingly far away from what we think is nifty. <br><br>That hostility gets tossed into there is an unfortunate social side-effect, based on being splintered off from the fringe of a splinter group, personal incompatibility, and the fact that the net is a shit place for communications much of the time. Let us not become victims of our own rhetoric here, okay?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ok, so we have a survey on a site devoted primarily to indie rpgs which indicates that the people who care enough to post at that site prefer indie rpgs.  Let's extrapolate out from that.<br><br>Firstly, if each person who tried indie rpgs never went back to trad, but the rate of people taking up trad was greater, trad would still overwhelmingly dominate.  If two people per day take up trad and one person per day leaves trad for indie, trad is not going to be replaced by indie.  The OP recognises this, but since we don't know what the replacement rate is we can't really go on to make any meaningful statement about how trad and indie relate, assuming that is even that meaningful a split in the first place.<br><br>Secondly, if you start from a low base expansion tends to be exponential, then slow down.  In the 1990s several UK law firms experienced massive expansion becoming truly global players.  If we extrapolate out, by about 100 years from now at that rate of expansion the entire human race will be UK lawyers, advising each other while the food runs out.  Extrapolation leads to bizarre outcomes if taken too far.<br><br>By mainstream publishers we've clarified we mean some freelancers whose income is directly threatened, so I don't think that tells us much.<br><br>Lastly though, surely this is precisely what we would expect?  Who is most likely to try out a new type of rpg?  An indie game?  Well, probably someone who is interested in playing something different to what they are playing now.  Why would someone be looking to play something other than what they are playing now?  Probably because they're not entirely content with what they're playing now.<br><br>So, people who are not happy with their trad rpgs but who enjoy indie rpgs once they find indie rpgs tend then to play the games they like and not those they liked less.  Um, yes.<br><br>I'm not sure what conclusions you're seeking to draw here, but it looks like a bit of a statement of the obvious coupled with flawed extrapolations from catchup expansion figures tied to a deeply biased (in the sense of skewed, not prejudiced) sample source.  If something starts with few people involved and expands percentage wise the expansion will look significant.  <br/><br/>If on day one 1 person likes my game, and one person more likes it each day for a month, at the end of that month I have had a 3000% expansion, I still only have 30 people who like my game.  If I ask around on the historical gaming yahoogroup to see which people there only play historical rpgs, I will soon find that in fact a significant percentage of gamers surveyed only like historical rpgs.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, all this tells us is that people who like indie rpgs like indie rpgs, and I'm not sure that adds much to the sum of human knowledge.<br/><br/>More broadly, I think most gamers either welcome the addition of indie games or are utterly indifferent to them.  Such hostility as there is is not I'm afraid to the games, it's to individuals who promote them badly. <br/><br/>In fact, I'd go further, given the support indie games get from the mainstream gaming industry, with people like Robin Laws, Mike Mearls and above all Ken Hite routinely plugging indie games, why aren't they getting more love and attention?  Given the mainstream industry backing for the indie movement, why isn't it more popular?<br/><br/>That's not a snide remark, answer that and I think they can be made more popular.  Heavyweight industry guys back indie gaming, nobody seems to be listening, that I think is a much more interesting issue.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            To add a more positive comment, this is what I posted on therpgsite in response to Levi's query about why indie sales are growing:<br/><br/>"Hm, why are sales of games that are relatively cheap but that are complete in one book increasing? Particularly why is that happening when you can chat to the authors online, get a direct blast of their enthusiasm and get really clear descriptions before laying down your money of what the game is like and what it does so that there is only a minimal risk of making a bad purchase?<br/><br/>I mean, I could buy a book that comes in glossy hardback, costs more and won't be playable until I buy three or more supplements and then find out I don't really like it as much as I thought I would. Given that alternative, why would anyone buy a fun little game that's cheap and wholly self-contained?<br/><br/>Not meaning to be snarky btw, but I am tired today so if I sound so just let me know. My point is, they sell for damn good reasons, they sell because they are entry level priced games by and large that are complete on purchase and where you can get solid info on them before purchasing. I expect them to sell more and to increase in popularity.<br/><br/>Oh, also they started from such a low sales base that any improvement will be significant, but I think there is more to it than that. <br/><br/>Why aren't the mainstream companies doing likewise? Because their current model is glossy hardbacks sold on aesthetics rather than utility and with the need for further purchases. It's the opposite of the indie sales philosophy and personally I think the indie approach is far better suited to actual gamers."<br/><br/>I still think the question though is not why are sales increasing, I think the reasons for that are obvious, but why aren't they increasing faster?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Given the mainstream industry backing for the indie movement, why isn't it more popular?</blockquote>
Glossy hardcovers.<br/>Brick and Mortar Game store penetration.<br/>Marketing.<br/><br/>We sacrifice the above to get games written and published. Or avoid the above because there's more pitfalls than there are worth.<br/><br/>But if Vincent decided to do the typical small mainstream press thing, and get his game printed as a hardcover 8.5x11 filled with illustrations, then take out that home loan for about 10K, and print up a could thousand copies, then spend money on advertising in Game Trade and other pubs, I'm sure that Dogs int he Vineyard would enjoy resting on the same level of "success" (ie: popularity and recognition) as some of the respected mid/lower tier games like Heavy Gear or Blue Planet. <br/><br/>He'd get fuckall for profit, because of the money sucked away into the ether by the three-tier system, basically the effort and time expended on the glossy covers, marketing, distro, etc vs the sales that come back would mean that he probably made just about the same as he would have if he did it himself as he does now.<br/><br/>But more people would have heard of the game!  More stores around the globe would place it on their shelves and in their bargain bins! Is that not popularity?  Success?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Glossy hardcovers.<br/>Brick and Mortar Game store penetration.<br/>Marketing.</blockquote>
Some indie games of course do now have glossy hardcovers.  Palladium still don't but they still sell.  The gloss helps, but it's not essential.<br/><br/>Every indie game I own I bought in a brick and mortar store, plus I think internet sales are increasingly important.  Again, I don't see this as a major obstacle.<br/><br/>As for marketing, they are marketed right now, and there are plenty of games in my FLGS that I'm pretty sure have no real marketing budget attached to them.<br/><br/>Thing is, I was speaking really to the thesis here, that there is some kind of trend or pattern.  I don't think there is, other than the trend that well made games at a good price point will tend to find an audience.  There was also a thesis that the mainstream was hostile, I think that is profoundly wrong and is close to anti-marketing because if you spread the idea of them and us you are more likely to make them hostile.  The fact of saying it can make it so.<br/><br/>Them ain't hostile, but most gamers play trad games, tell them that trad gamers don't like indie games and as part of their self-identification I think you will make them more likely to dislike indie games than otherwise would have been the case.  There is a ghettoisation, which is really what I'm getting at.  A desire to be different which gets in the way of actually getting people to play the games.<br/><br/>I think part of what holds indie games back is not a lack of marketing, it's the presence next to the good marketing of some profoundly bad marketing which sets up unnecessary barriers and creates needless tribalism.  If people feel that buying an indie game is somehow disloyal, they won't buy.<br/><br/>I'm getting offtopic so I'll stop, but essentially the concepts underlying this thread are I think a key reason why indie games don't sell as well as they could do.  Because people are being asked not to buy a game, but to buy a philosophy.  Some are happy to buy both, but some just wanted the game and they're being put off.                        </div>

<i>indie games are not a small counter-entropic bubble in the vastly larger entropic system of mainstream gaming; indie gaming is (becoming) a different thing altogether.</i><br/><br/>I am all about this statement, for more reasons than I have time to detail.  To keep it short: what attracted me to the indie game scene was a community of people talking about improving the rp experience, people who were more invested in that than they were in making money off of the products of that discussion.  That is not to say I saw the community as a batch of idealists who don't care about making money.  <br/><br/>It is to say I saw it as a community more concerned with the game experience than with the money produced around it, who saw the money that might emerge as an extension of that discussion more than an essential component of it.  I was tired of consumerism generally, and in gaming particularly.  This community, the indie community, was a welcome breath of fresh air.                        </div>

                            Hi Balbinus,<br/>
<br/>
You wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
"There is a ghettoisation, which is really what I'm getting at. A desire to be different which gets in the way of actually getting people to play the games."<br/>
<br/>
Now, you may know such people. I'm not saying you don't. I'm saying, I haven't encountered them, and I suspect I'm not one of them.<br/>
<br/>
In all the examples of people I mentioned in my first long post above (at a Con, a friend of mine), they got excited from actual play or from hearing about the concepts. They got <i>turned on</i> to the play.<br/>
<br/>
I keep hearing this line of logic and I simply don't buy it because I don't see it.<br/>
<br/>
How about a simpler, more naive view of the situation: People have a desire to have fun, and these games provide the fun <i>these people</i> are looking for. It's not about the "desire to be different."<br/>
<br/>
And it's certianly not about ghettoisation, since I know for a fact that people who <i>wouldn't have been playing RPGs are now playing them are now playing because of these games</i>. (See my posts above, see Ron's Actual Play posts about playing with his neighbors....) More people are playing (not a lot, but more), people who would have always been outside the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I'd say it's the absolute opposite of ghettoisation. It's a bunch of people who've be living in a particular few blocks with a particular culture, dominated by a certain logic about what fun is, who haven't been very happy with the results. They notice a neighborhood a few blocks away with different architcture and festivals and say, "Oh, you mean, there's whole new neighborhood over here, where I could meet more people with my tastes?" To use <i>your</i> metaphor, some people are <i>leaving</i> the ghetto. Not entering it.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I find your point of view on this matter strange. Really, maybe Joshua and I and others are simply <i>enjoying</i> the games. Is that so peculiar a concept?<br/>
<br/>
Christopher<br/>
<br/>
PS There are "philosophical" elements, of course, though I'd call them cultural. That ownership of your creative output is worth keeping, for example. There are some ideas about what "stories" are (or interesting stories at least.) But I still don't see how this is about "putting people off." It's about finding the people you want to be with.<br/>
<br/>
And all this has everything to do with why Ron linked those threads back to the Infamous Five above.                        </div>

Plainly I explained myself badly.<br><br>What I was getting at is that categorising them as indie games or suggesting that one should embrace a category of games and leave behind another, something I've seen two or three times in the last few days is ghettoisation and puts people off.<br><br>Talking about how fun a given game is is not remotely ghettosation, it's talking about how fun a game is.<br><br>That's why today on a thread on rpg.net where someone asked to be sold indie games I didn't, instead I told him why I think PTA rocks.<br><br>I'll explain more later when I have time, as clearly I failed earlier.  What I was trying to say is what you are saying here, I think, talk about the games because the games are fun.  Talk about the fun.  The philosophy isn't liking the game, the philosophy is the suggestion that because I like game x I should drop game y.  That is what gets in the way and that I do encounter quite often.<br><br>Liking PTA does not mean I can't also like Runequest, and where ghettoisation comes in is when someone suggests people should be converted from trad games to indie games, instead of saying "hey check out this game, it's really fun".  That's what creates needless division, if however you show somebody a fun game and they then go on only to play games like that that's not creating a ghetto it's just people playing what they like.<br><br>I'm not talking against making positive statements about indie games, I'm all for that and I do it myself.  If you look at the rest of the para you clipped my quote from though you'll see that what I was talking about was negativity, about talking down trad games instead of talking up indie games.  Or better yet, ignoring the labels and just talking up games you love.<br><br>Check out post 25, which is by me, in this thread <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=6272619#post6272619" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=6272619#post6272619</a><br><br>That's what I'm talking about, not drawing distinctions and retreating into camps but saying "hey, PTA rocks, check it out it's a great game" without saying "and by the way, once you get into it you will leave behind other games you like".  That latter bit is not a selling point.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

My line of logic was that I shouldn't be asked to have to make some kind of choice, that I shouldn't be put in the position of having to choose.  That was all.  I get the feeling you thought I was saying that the fact of playing indie games is ghettoisation, that the fact of playing them is the philosophical choice.<br><br>That is not what I was saying.  I play these games, among others.<br><br>As I said, I'll come back to this but I think you're reading in stuff that wasn't there, or wasn't intended to be.  My argument is that we should play the games and celebrate the games, but we should not in the process create an us and them mentality that will force people to choose between one type of game and another.  Nor should we suggest that liking one type is somehow inferior, if only because saying stuff like that puts people off what are often great games.<br><br>I really like My Life with Master, I think PTA is brilliant, I'm less personally enamoured of Dogs though I see the skill, BW is again great.    I find nothing odd that some folk like these so much they don't play stuff like Runequest or whatever any more.  What I find odd is when some people proselytise and suggest that I shouldn't either or that once I get into these games I won't like the others.<br><br>Being indie is not a selling point.  Being a great game is a selling point.  I think it's time to stop comparing to trad games and just pitch on the basis of them being great games.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Balbinus, I'm after a trend, but not the one you think.  I care fuck-all about "having more sales than X."  What I'm interested in right now is if exposure and minimal buy-in to indie games has a lasting impact on purchasing habits.  I'm looking at the delta-vee, not the position, ya dig?<br/><br/>Sure, surveying story-games is a little self-selecting; that's why I asked about posting the same survey elsewhere, but nobody's responded to that bit at all.  I'll post it up to RPG.net (and watch it get flamed to death), but I don't have an account at RPGsite and don't have much interest in getting one.<br/><br/>Industry disdain was a red herring; I'm sorry I included it.  The loud few overwhelmed the rest in my head and I should think straighter than that.<br/><br/>Your last bit, though, is closer to what I'm getting at -- I don't agree that potential customers of indie games are really asked to buy the philosophy along with the book (except maybe for Sorcerer).  I run a slate of indie games at the local cons, and we get folks who have never played anything outside of D&amp;D/WoD/CoC, come to our table, and have a ball.  There's no indoctrination beforehand.  We just play, and we play by the procedures of the game.  That the procedures of the game are founded on a different design philosophy that the other games they've been playing are based on simply doesn't come up.  I don't think I've "talked theory" at the con once.<br/><br/>Now, actual play aside, are indie games often presented and marketed as a lifestyle choice and philosophy rather than just games?  Still I don't think so.  I think if your vantage is from the middle of story-games or the Forge, you'd certainly see a lot of design philosophy, but just because people (including the designer) are talking about the game doesn't mean that they're trying to promote the game, and certainly doesn't mean they are only promoting the game there.  I doubt any of the published indie designers would try and pitch their game by pitching the philosophy behind it; I'm pretty sure they'd focus on the color and gameplay, since that's what interests potential players.<br/><br/><em>After</em> the initial buy-in (both in terms of purchase and play), I think there's a sort of connection that often happens.  A lightbulb goes on, the player finds something that they like, and <em>they want more</em>.  They go to lumpley.com after playing <em>Dogs</em>, maybe they talk a bit, but they find the link to Dog Eared Designs and they pick up <em>Primetime Adventures</em>.  Do the players tend towards joining in on the 'philosophy' discussions?  Sure, mostly cause they're there, and because they're excited.  But the participation in the philosophy -- which may or may not happen -- occurs <em>after</em> the actual play and the engagement of the game itself.<br/><br/>That's, at least, the theory.                        </div>

It's not a <b>sensible</b> selling point, but can you honestly tell me that you'd rather see "Movie X" as opposed to "The CULT CLASSIC, Movie Y, made by three guys on a shoe-string budget, and so controversial it was banned in Alberta"?<br/><br/>I get what you're saying about indie-ness having a downside, but I'm pretty sure there's an upside there as well.                        </div>

                            Guys, I have to run, will post back but nothing in Joshua's last post I disagreed with.<br/><br/>Certainly indie games have changed how I play, and I think there is a real trend there.  I think what may be unclear is that I was talking about some bad marketing next to the good marketing, ie I think there is a particular way of marketing that is counterproductive and which I thought Joshua was going to with the industry comments.<br/><br/>He wasn't and that's cool, when I have time I'll come back on all the good stuff indie games have done for me (for there are many) and what I think the bad marketing is that sometimes lets down the good.  Sadly with rpg.net's search function down I'll struggle to find examples but will if I can.<br/><br/>Put shortly, I thought Joshua was saying something that yes I have seen others say, but he in fact wasn't.  The bad marketing I saw elsewhere may be better a topic for another thread though.                        </div>

                            Hi Balbinus,<br/>
<br/>
I'll just point to what Tony wrote and say, "What he said."<br/>
<br/>
When you wrote people are "suggesting that one should embrace a category of games and leave behind another," I have to say, my response was, "Really? They are?" Because as Tony noted, people are simply stating <i>what's happening.</i> I didn't notice anyone was advocating this. Certainly I haven't been.<br/>

                            No one will ever know or be able to make even faintly educated guesses about trends about mainstream gaming until someone pays a professional money to find them out.  Ever.  Until that happens all we have is bullshit anecdotes.                        </div>

                            Enh.  JD, no one will make verifiable, certifiable conclusions about mainstream gaming until they outlay some cash.  That doesn't mean that nobody will have the pulse of the market without that.  They'll just have nothing to back up their claims except "I have a hunch" or "My experience suggests..."<br><br>I mean, certainty is one thing.  Knowledge is another.                        </br></br></div>

                            Well, there's little value here in my going into stuff I've seen elsewhere.  We've clarified that I misread Joshua and that's cool hopefully.<br><br>So, I will add what indie games have done for me, which I think is linked to what they have done for many others here.<br><br>They reminded me that gaming was about play.  That rpgs were tools to be used for play and that an unplayed game makes the baby Jesus cry.<br><br>I buy fewer rpgs now, those I buy are far more likely to get played, it's not yet where I want to be which is that I buy nothing I don't play, but habits take time to break.<br/><br/>The thing is, when I started out in gaming, games were published mostly because someone had something they wanted out there.  An rpg about Salem in 1692?  Sure.  A swashbuckling quasi-skirmish game based on Dumas?  Why not?  An rpg about post-apocalyptic gonzoid mutants going wild?  Sounds good.<br/><br/>Over time, I think  a lot of that spirit got lost.  The desire to make a game not because it would sell so much, as because it was a game you thought would be cool.  Selling was often secondary, which may of course be why many of those guys went bust.<br/><br/>There was a homebrew spirit, a DIY ethos, part of the hobby was making your own rules or kitbashing whatever you got.<br/><br/>Now, this isn't quite the same.  With the current diy thing you may well create your own game but generally you're not expected to homerule some other guys.  But the essential spirit is the same.  Games made not to sit on the shelf, but because some madwhack guy thought a game about time travelling inca car salesmen would rock and hey, maybe it will.<br/><br/>Over the 1990s I think the hobby slightly lost its way, supplements, splatbooks, glossy art and pages of fiction.  Stuff that didn't help actual play, and that to an extent started to get rated higher than stuff that does help actual play.<br/><br/>The indie movement is all about the play, gloss is good where gloss serves play, but gloss is not of itself a goal.<br/><br/>And that, that is most cool, hell it's even old school.  And, for me at least, it reminded me that buying an rpg for the reading and admiration was a waste of my time when I could be buying rpgs and playing the hell out of them.<br/><br/>So, that's my bullshit anecdote (to paraphrase JD), and although I do mostly still play trad games I think the impact on my gaming is similar to what many others are reporting, a renewed emphasis on buying for utility, buying for play and putting play back at the heart of the hobby.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
