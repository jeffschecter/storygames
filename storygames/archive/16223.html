Now that Indie Hurricane at Gamestorm is done and still fresh in our minds, I as convention organizer wanted to ask you all for feedback: <b>What worked, what did you struggle with, and what was missing?</b><br/><br/>This will likely be several threads. We already <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=369158" rel="nofollow">talked about the games themselves</a> (please continue this trend!), so what I want to know next is: how did the play space work for you?<br/><br/>To reiterate what the space was like: Indie Hurricane games were scheduled in Room Birch and the "Upper Lobby" surrounding Birch. There were three big round tables in the Upper Lobby, as well as  three (I think) couch-and-coffee-table setups of various designs. Inside Birch were 8 rectangular tables pushed together to make 4 large square tables. I noticed there wasn't space to walk through the room, so on Friday afternoon I asked hotel staff to remove two tables, making two large squares and two small rectangles.<br/><br/>The Gamestorm office and swag room was operating out of Ash, tucked into a corner behind all this. The room was open at various times a day for people to turn in the Gamestorm Bucks they had earned by running games, in exchange for products donated by retailers, organizations, publishers, etc.<br/><br/>Indie Hurricane also held panels in room Alder downstairs by the main lobby and registration tables, some games in Children's programming in Discovery B, one game in the LARP room in Discovery DE, and Sea Dracula upstairs in Oak (way down the hall and tucked away around a corner). And we had an Indie Hurricane booth in the Dealers' Room, with tables nearby for demoing games.<br/><br/>So, <b>what worked, what did you struggle with, and what was missing?</b> Did the tables work well? Which tables sizes and shapes were most convenient? Was there some seating arrangement you found yourself wishing for?<br/><br/>Was the space itself pleasing? Were games crowded together or did you have plenty of elbow room? Was it a relaxing environment to play in? How was noise?<br/><br/>Did you have an ok time finding your way around? What could've been clearer?<br/><br/>(next topic: game scheduling!)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS. I'm <a href="http://www.goplaypdx.com/forum/index.php?topic=1026.0" rel="nofollow">crossposting this to the Go Play PDX forums</a> since that's online homebase for the Portland indie gaming community.

That small room was pretty rough, though. I only played one game in there, but it was pretty tough to move, and you couldn't hear your own thoughts sometimes, what with all the other voices all going simultaneously. Too bad there weren't more open spaces available, but I understand that we're not exactly the highest priority.<br/>I actually kind of liked the space that was made available for children's gaming. Yeah, kind of noisy with the children and overflow board gamers, but because the ceiling was so high, and the tables spaced far enough apart, I could still hear my players pretty clearly.<br/>In my explorations, it always seemed like some of the other groups upstairs had more than enough room to play in, if not having tons of unused space (seems like it would've been better if we had the space the CCG gamers were using).<br/>I think we should've had a posted schedule of all Indie Hurricane games for the whole convention, so it'd be easier to see what was coming up. The white board Hans brought was a good resource, too.<br/><br/>As for the booth, I think it could've stood to have a bit more visability. While this was my first game con, I had to work booths at anime cons before, and I thought it certainly could use some spicing up. Next year, assuming I'm still working at a print shop, I may donate a bunch of small (12x18 inch) poster-prints of the various games for sale that can be posted. I can also source some good table-top display units, if anyone thinks that'd help. On the plus side, the booth had a very friendly atmosphere in comparison to many of the others (at least in my opinion).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369904/#Comment_369904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T00:50:23+00:00" title="March 29, 2012 12:50AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2012 12:50AM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>I can also source some good table-top display units, if anyone thinks that'd help.</blockquote>\nWe thought we were going to have those from a previous person who ran the booth, but at the last minute he told us he didn't have them.

It was hard to do horror in the daytime under the neon lights, but we made a good effort at it.<br/><br/>P.S. I thought the booth was just fine.  Had a very indie vibe, especially with all the pamplet-style games on the front of the table facing the rest of the sales space.  We were also right across from IPR, which made for decent synergy.

Everyone who wants to know what your doing but does not want to interrupt can just take them and have their curiosity satisfied.<br/><br/>we had two small rooms last year and i liked the combo this year better. perhaps schedule fewer/quieter games in the room and louder games in the hallway? we had the room to ourselves for motobushido and it was great. <br/><br/>the booth was fine, more verticallity would be good.<br/><br/>To that end. if you liked my little display they can be bought at tap plastics for about 6-20 bucks depending on their size and configuration , i have had that one i used for YEARS so it's worth the tiny investment to buy your own stand.<br/><br/>I think it would be great to fully partner up with gamelab and share a booth next year (maybe a slightly larger booth? gamelab has some pull)<br/><br/>thanks for putting it together joel!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370028/#Comment_370028" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T13:26:06+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  1:26PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite><br/>I think it would be great to fully partner up with gamelab and share a booth next year (maybe a slightly larger booth? gamelab has some pull)<br/></blockquote>\nThat would be cool.

Our game schedule was so sparse that I was able to spread the games thinly across the tables, like only a couple in any one room at any given time. Often you'd walk into Ash or Birch and see only one game running there.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the rest of the Gamestorm committee noticed this too, so when they needed a room for their Operations center, they said "Heyyyy Jooooellll, it looks you didn't really use all your table space this year." and there wasn't much I could say to rebut that, so the room got cut. Before this, I had talked with the ConCom room coordinator about getting rid of one of the Birhc squares because it was so crowded, but after we lost Ash I thought better of it.<br/><br/>This year, we had less assigned tablespace, but MANY more people playing games, which means those funky couch spaces got used more, which is super-great. I also saw people dragging a rectangular table from Birch out into the hall, which is also way cool in my book.<br/><br/>So the big question is, what can we do for next year to help the space serve us? This year's space was, I feel, <i>exactly right</i> for the needs of the crew that attended. If we grow, we need to accommodate that. A simple solution would be to ask for Ash back, and I think we've got good grounds for needing it based on this convo. But then how do we deal with the crowding/noise issue in the two rooms?

In fact, one of my favorite Gamestorm games was from a couple of years ago, when Michael P. and Hans and I played Fuck Youth in the little nook by the elevator upstairs. Like Jackson, I'd love to play in the park sometime, but I feel like the weather's never quite warm enough for that to work. As far as the other spaces I used, Mouse Guard in Discovery B was fine (the high ceilings helped), and Shelter In Place in Discovery DE was, as was mentioned in the SIP thread, a little too crowded, though I don't think there was another space that would have worked better.<br/><br/>I actually really liked having the office right by the IH stuff. There was a lot of foot traffic, which helped make it feel like the stuff we were playing had a lot of visibility, and very little of it was particularly disruptive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370374/#Comment_370374" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T00:22:46+00:00" title="April  1, 2012 12:22AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't venture into the crowded noisy Birch, but ran five pickup games (Technoir, Umbra, 3 x Monsterhearts) and played one (Mustang) on the lovely round tables outside it, which I liked a lot.
