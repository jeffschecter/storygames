It's been a blast so far. I have maybe a dozen people on a mailing list, and when I want to play I send out a few choices for time and date, and we play on the most popular date with whoever can make it. It works really well!<br/><br/>I've been running "Tower of the Stargazer" and "The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh" for groups of mostly 4-5 people, and it's been a lot of fun. But yesterday we had the first "big" combat, against the alchemist's skeletons in Saltmarsh. It was slow and boring!<br/><br/>I've read lots of articles about how to make Basic D&amp;D combats more interesting, and I've done a few things in my hack to help that (it's much easier to hit, initiative depends on positioning and reach, non-punitive "called shots" and so on). But the basics of rolling back and forth until there's an outcome is still SUPER dull. I'm worried that if we end up having a bunch more people turn up one session, the combats will be even slower and more boring.<br/><br/>What I'd like is to steal a page from Tunnels and Trolls, and have a "group melee" mechanic. Something where you add up hit dice on either side, roll a bunch of dice once, and then assign outcomes to people - damage and such, and then you're done. The problem is that the math is really hard, and I'd like to be able to roll it out with some confidence at my next session.<br/><br/>Thoughts?

Complications rather than outright failure  or narrative bonuses when they score a critical hit.  All this is embedded in the fiction, so I might say that if the player misses, they can still roll damage, but they suffer a HP off fatigue damage, lose their weapon, or their shield breaks or their backpack is torn off or they move ever further away from their objective, or they are separated from their friends, or they lose the memorised spell etc.... The 'World games GM 'Moves' list is invaluable here. I use this ALL the time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  In effect this stops players from being bored on a miss, gives them difficult choices to make<br/><br/>Even if they hit, before they roll damage I might give them the same complication options, with the benefit being that they score maximum damage, or even that they render the opponent incapacitated in the context of that combat (but they still have a prisoner to deal with after).<br/><br/>Dont forget the morale roll. I offer the players chances to effect the morale roll of the monsters (B27) , by giving me a fictional justification. More often than not, monsters seem to flee in our games after they have taken losses to half their forces.<br/><br/>In particular to Saltmarsh, make all the skeletons minions like in 4e. One hit and they are dead. But make them SWARM the players. Cleric retainers come in handy too. I use an abridged Burning Wheel Circles mechanic in my BX game with my brothers; they can roll under their CHA stat with a modifier and introduce NPC's that they 'need' to the game. If they fail, well the NPC is still introduced, but when and where is up to me now and they are definitely not favourable toward the characters!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376667/#Comment_376667" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T00:42:05+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 12:42AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>What I'd like is to steal a page from Tunnels and Trolls, and have a "group melee" mechanic.

The problem is that the math is really hard, and I'd like to be able to roll it out with some confidence at my next session.<br/></blockquote>\nHere's one way to emulate T&amp;T in D&amp;D:<br/><br/>Everybody on one side rolls at once. The highest single outcome within the group counts. Compare the result with the highest AC (or AC of the champion, if they put one forward) among the opposition. If the attack hits, that pair (highest attack vs. highest AC) causes damage normally. For each full five points of difference in favour of the attacking side the lead attacker selects an ally who also causes damage, while the defending side chooses who'll take the hit. So if you hit AC+5 then two members of the party hit, AC+10 three hit, etc.<br/><br/>Note that both sides can roll at the same time here, so there's no need for initiative. Have a free and clear phase before each combat round so players can declare non-melee action and maneuver. Don't allow missile fire (or missile-like magic) into the melee, but if players want to do it anyway, the archers don't count for the melee round and any damage they cause is split randomly among the melee participants. Split combat groups as necessary, so that if e.g. the party is attacked from two sides at once, you might have the players choose who'll fight on which front before resolving them separately. If maneuvers conflict (two parties both want to claim the high ground against the other, say) and you don't feel like e.g. letting the highest Dex decide who gets their way, have all clashing intents fall back into the default melee.<br/><br/>Elaborations should be added to reach the optimal amount of mechanical detail for the group at this time (that is, keep flexible and add or reduce detail as you play). I would add +1 per attacker and +2 per decent attack so as to account for the numbers a bit and to cause more damage to be delivered, for example. Counting a natural '20' for an extra level of success or an exploding die is a good idea, too. As I use relatively static damage dice, I would also simplify the damage assignation and just say that it's d6 per degree of success (per five points over AC, that is) distributed as evenly as possible among the enemy. (That is, distribute the dice and before rolling them.)<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I don't go for a group melee in D&amp;D in practice, as we're pretty good at making our ordinary melees plenty interesting. This is, I think, most importantly because we've pretty much gotten rid of the attitude that you just roll to hit in combat and that's it. There are many mechanical routes for achieving this (and no, I don't think that mechanization of individual combat maneuvers is the way to go), but in our specific case complex initiative, stunting on attacks and ample, fiction-based modifiers on combat checks have been more than enough. Also, lethal combat: as our parties routinely include mostly 1st level characters with the few successful veterans, there's plenty of mortal danger each round. Mastering the routines also helps, as e.g. a dozen identical enemies can be handled nearly as quickly as a single one by rolling all attacks at once (we have a lot of dice at the table) and assigning targets semi-arbitrarily.<br/><br/>This is not to say that we don't have pointless combat situations; such usually happen when the party is very much in control of the fight. In these situations intelligent opposition escapes, cutting the combat short, but what to do with non-intelligent obstacles? My solution is to use a subgame shortcut, something I do a lot to abstract dull or difficult processes in the game. In the case of combat the GM (or a player, they offer these too) would stop for a moment at the end of a combat round to offer that the party can finish the battle without further losses in exchange for e.g. one die of damage against everybody. Or a 1/2 chance of a die of damage against one character chosen by the players. Or how about, these guys make one more round of attacks against you without the circumstance penalties you've piled up against them, and then we'll say that you killed them. The idea is that the GM offers a quick approximation of about how much danger is left in the fight for a party that doesn't take any unnecessary risks. If the GM lowballs it enough while remaining reasonably realistic, the players will probably accept this extra-mechanical deal, which saves everybody the bother of going through another five rounds of combat with little chance of significant loss.<br/><br/>(It occurs to me that one reason the above works so well for us is that hitpoints are not as valuable at our table as the average. All characters can get their dice points rerolled with a short rest after a battle for only a minor expense, so we're not so interested in whether a character is going to take two more points of damage. If it seems to everybody that characters are unlikely to get real injury out of the rest of the fight, it's much easier to accept a shortcut. I can imagine how the issue of whether the last skeleton might be able to damage you a bit more would be much more interesting if characters only healed one hit point per day.)<br/><br/>Also, we do of course have a range of different procedures for larger combats out of skirmish scale, but I don't think that's what you're asking about here.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear more about why ordinary combat is dull with you. What do you do in combat in practice? Do the players try to figure out the most effective and reasonable positioning and ways of attack? Does the GM do any fog of war, or is all intelligence in the heat of combat reliably and complete? Thinking about it, it might be that the single most important reason combat remains entertaining at our table is that players remain uncertain about the outcome. When there is no longer this tension, we have the combat end quickly one way or another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376669/#Comment_376669" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T00:48:08+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 12:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sean,<br/><br/>Good suggestions, though I'd rather avoid the "add a million dice together to do a handful of damage" aspect of T&amp;T.

We're playing a very strategic game, where the players need to be able to predict likely outcomes based on available information. If I'm upsetting the playing field by giving players creative options, it makes combat more interesting at the expense of undermining the tactical purity of play. Essentially, I'm not looking for ways to make combat more exciting, so much as I am looking for ways to make it faster. There's plenty of excitement outside of combat, we just need the fights to be over faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376673/#Comment_376673" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T01:01:53+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  1:01AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>I'd like to hear more about why ordinary combat is dull with you.

(And your suggestions above are excellent too).<br/><br/>We've had some very fun, very interesting combats before: The Stone Spider in Tower of the Stargazer was fun. I could describe it crawling all over people, making it hard for them to use their best weapons, leaping from person to person, scuttling across the ceiling and such, all of which gave the characters interesting choices and made the combat fun. We had a similarly interesting (and quick) situation with some random giant ants in Saltmarsh.<br/><br/>The difficulty was that the skeletons were a mass of unintelligent foes, marching forward in a relatively uniform mass. There was some fun skirmishing with them at first, but once the players decided that their best bet was just to suit up and go toe-to-toe with them, since they could easily retreat if things looked bad, the fight quickly turned into a slugging match. There's only so much you can do in that situation to liven up such a combat. I guess I could have made it more interesting using some of the techniques you describe, but looking ahead to combats where I may have four or five Player Fighters against twice that many Beastmen or something (I'm thinking about offering "Caverns of Thracia"), I can't  combat that large and long not turning into a simple numerical excercise, just from creative exhaustion on all sides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376675/#Comment_376675" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T01:27:52+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  1:27AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fighting skeletons is something we've had a lot of experience with. The <i>Tomb of the Iron God</i> is crawling with them, and we're just now doing an annual revisit to the place (played it through last spring, and now one of the players is running a "Return to the Tomb of the Iron God" for us). I agree that skeletons are a mechanical and predictable foe, it's a big part of their thing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>There was some fun skirmishing with them at first, but once the players decided that their best bet was just to suit up and go toe-to-toe with them, since they could easily retreat if things looked bad, the fight quickly turned into a slugging match.</blockquote>\nYeah, I've totally had this. Our players have managed to become slug-worthy with skeletons by two ways: one is for low-level characters to use large portable walls (mantlets, pavises) and fire weapons, the other is for a fairly leveled fighter (say third level) in heavy plate to just take the fight to them, preferably with some sooper seecret fighting techniques or a magic sword or whatever is that particular fighter's "thing". Both of these methods often result in a fight that everybody, GM included, think will be a done deal in quick order. The mantlets, for example, provide characters with +5 to AC when used appropriately against skeletons, and if they fight defensively (that is, do not take attack rolls but focus merely on keeping the mantlets upright and themselves safe behind them), that's a further bonus that'll make it very difficult for the skeletons to overcome the party in a narrow place as long as there's not enough of them to swarm over the 5 feet high mantlets. We did this just last session, took down a dozen skeletons with a 1st level party by positioning ourselves behind a pit with some mantlets and nets of all things (supposed to be for taking down stirges, but whatever).<br/><br/>As I described above, our main method for dealing with the slugging fatigue you describe is to negotiate a shortcut once the situation has been stabilized enough that both sides can gauge the likely outcome. My sincere belief is that it's methodically kosher in D&amp;D to negotiate whatever terms the GM and the players both find fair in terms of likely outcomes. You could even create a special table for "single roll combat resolution" easily enough, to be used in all situations where a skirmish has been brought into a static position and established as a fight of attrition. Or just keep an eye out for the key tactical questions so you can cleave into the bone of the matter instead of focusing on uninteresting detal; you can always ask the players about their tactical intent and use it to create shortcuts. "Is your intent to continue holding the doorway until the goblins go away? Oh it is? OK, so their plan is to surprise you with a sudden push in five minutes or so, once you're used to the stalemate. So how about we roll 1/3 to see if they manage to surprise you, and continue the fight from there if they manage to secure the doorway? I figure that we don't have much of a fight here unless they do, so there's no point going through it minute by minute."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376679/#Comment_376679" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T01:54:07+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  1:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that seems sensible, and completely in line with what we've done previously in terms of tone and style.<br/><br/>A "One roll Resolution Table" is a tempting idea though, at least as a guideline from which to make offers which take into account specific local conditions.

You can do it, but its ZZZzzzzzZZZZz time.  To be more effective, (deal more damage and finish the fight quickly) you have to change it up tactically in some fashion.  So the more interesting you make things, the more effective you are, on the whole.<br/><br/>My problem with <i>big</i> fights,  however (say 5 vs 5 or more), is theres only so many tactically interesting things you can have going on in one situation - in the same space so to speak.  So , how do you handle that?  My untested theory is for the GM to simplify his 'side' so that they all act according to a single plan, and each individual or group of mooks does something to contribute to that one plan/tactic/strategy.

"Axiomatic" in the sense that e.g. Simon might not want to abandon those values to do this. To wit:<ul><li>Monster statistics are usually not arbitrary; if you swap them up to make fights more entertaining, you're abandoning what logic there might be there.</li><li>The GM is not responsible for fun; if you ask the GM to plan combats for fun, you're asking him to shoulder a new responsibility foreign to some types of D&amp;D.</li><li>The GM cannot plan the conditions of combat in advance; if you decide that a future combat is going to involve e.g. abseiling, you're in conflict with the procedure of play.</li></ul>\nDoesn't of course mean that those aren't fine solutions within their limits. And it's true that GM's can and will look for similar values to the extent of their mandate: choose to create scenarios for interesting opposition instead of dull, try to be a fun person to game with and set up violent situations in difficult strategic conditions that breed extraordinary tactical solutions, like say abseiling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376936/#Comment_376936" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T09:58:28+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  9:58AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to recall Saltmarsh was a fairly low-level module.

The abstraction is basically the single most important reason why the combat system in earlier editions is better than that in the later ones. It enables more fictional positioning when things are exciting and players want it, and it's quicker and easier to scale back into simplification when you want to go faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376943/#Comment_376943" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T10:43:04+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 10:43AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 10:46AM by thadrine.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>The problem with these 4th edition solutions is that they ignore deeper axiomatic values to priorize entertaining combats.

Fighters have eight HP, and can ignore a hit in combat, other classes fewer HP. They're a bit tougher than regular first level characters, but only marginally. I've tried to set up the game so that a party that's prepared for a fight, with a front rank of fighters plus support from spears/bows can take on some respectable fights, but they're still very vulnerable if they're ambushed or outflanked.<br/><br/>Frank,<br/><br/>Good suggestions!<br/><br/>Thadrine,<br/><br/>I feel like we're maybe playing very different styles of D&amp;D.

The idea was to make the defining feature of Fighters that they can get into a fight with a reasonable assurance of surviving the first round or so. It's the payoff for not really knowing how dangerous any foe is ahead of time. The fighters get one "free" round of combat to assess the threat.<br/><br/>My belief is that it's better to have class features be automatic and reliable, so that the players can figure them into their assessment of the situation. By contrast, theives get one automatic success on a die roll, once per day. Scholars speak four languages, and they can choose their languages during play, as needed.<br/><br/>Roger,<br/><br/>It took maybe five or ten minutes? But this is against a backdrop of fully-engaged, fun play the rest of the time, so it really stood out. If there had been more than one combat like that in the game, it would have sucked considerably more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377077/#Comment_377077" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T20:47:40+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  8:47PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon C<br/><br/>Really, 5-10 minutes for an extended conflict resolution seemed too long?

The traditional approach I see people take to this is just to make all the surviving enemies run away or otherwise handwave them out of the picture. If you don't want to do that (and since it sounds like you guys dig the resource management aspect of the game a lot, you probably won't want to fudge like that), why not do the time and motion thing -- take the die rolls out. Estimate how much of the fight is over (based on the percentage of enemy hit points remaining), and multiply the amount of damage everybody's taken by the reciprocal of that percentage. It doesn't need to be perfectly accurate -- just eyeball it and say "okay, if you keep going like this, you're going to take X damage, you Y damage, and so forth, unless you want to try something else."<br/><br/>If this is still too much calculating for you, you can just multiply hit chance by average damage for every swing and just have every attack do its projected average damage until the fight's over. You'll still be calling out some numbers, but there won't be any rolling, reading, adding, and comparing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377222/#Comment_377222" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T16:06:24+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  4:06PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty convinced after last year's play that it's inherent to D&amp;D that its ordinary combat mechanics do not ensure 100% exciting combat all the time. Considering how different situations that simple system is supposed to handle, this is no wonder. Excitement is a non-trivial thing, it hasn't been bottled yet successfully. Simon's particular spin on the system might make some types of situations somewhat more or less exciting, but the basic issue remains in that there still surely exist valid combats that may be entered following the game's method, but which end up as too slow and dull to adjudicate by the system.<br/><br/>I do agree with the implicit suggestion here that making your 1st level characters so durable that they can enter combat and grow bored is part of the reason for why Simon's experiencing this phenomenon so early. However, that issue's going to come up sooner or later anyway. Also, proper skills make some types of 1st level combat relatively simple affairs, no matter the specific mechanical implementation of D&amp;D; I'll go against your 30 skeletons with my party of 5 1st level characters any day and make it look routine <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>So I think that what Simon is asking about is not about Simon - it's not a flaw in him that he thinks that D&amp;D combats are sometimes boring. As I've discussed upthread, I've noticed the same thing myself, and I've looked at the game's methodology to find the appropriate tools for fixing the issue. I'm not amazed that the game texts don't comment on this in an organized way, as the D&amp;D texts have traditionally been so focused on proper procedure that they hardly can have space for exceptions like what to do when the proper procedure is not the right one for the situation. Instead, the text just tells the GM to wing it where necessary. Well, I've winged it, and discussed my experiences of how one might go about it.<br/><br/>Oh, also, one more technique thing: I seem to remember writing before about how part of the skill-set is to go through certain procedures quickly and efficiently because they're basically not interesting per se before the dice and fiction happen to align in a good way. Rolling for random encounters is a pure example, you just roll the dice when you remember them and don't waffle with it. Searching for secret stuff and detecting traps and being paranoid in general is another example. Well, simple and one-sided combats are also like this: if the thing feels routine, then don't hesitate to just roll the dice and get on with it. The method does not mandate complex descriptions of every action; if players declare that their characters push into the melee, tie down their opponents and continue hacking until somebody gives way, then just roll the dice and see who it's going to be. A single combat round doesn't need to take more than a minute if nothing out of the ordinary is happening. So this is one technique: admit that the method relies on mechanical procedures that are not guaranteed interesting, and execute them with this in mind, with ruthless efficiency.<br/><br/>(The above might seem obvious, but for an indie-head like me it's necessarily not. The Forge-style game design teaches you to be moment-aware as you shift your weight and make moves in the mechanical and fictional spaces. It's a lot like some meditative practices in that regard, you move with intent and continuous awareness of yourself. D&amp;D is the opposite, it wants you to train habits and go through them ritually without thinking about them. I'm sure that an objective observer would see plenty of non-interesting content in our D&amp;D play, but it doesn't bother us in practice because the non-interesting routine happens automatically and everybody is actually already thinking about the next substantial bit.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377224/#Comment_377224" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T16:12:12+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  4:12PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger,<br/><br/>That's a really cool idea, and it would definitely fit with my general approach to D&amp;D. In practice it might be more bookkeeping than I'm prepared for though. The advantage of players rolling dice is they can keep track of their stats and bonuses and such (not that we have many of those).<br/><br/>Generally speaking, we use a lot more ability checks than is implied by standard D&amp;D, but fewer than you might find in, for example, 3e D&amp;D. Most things are resolved by detailed description of actions, and dice are rolled when it's not clear whether the character's abilities are sufficient to the task they're undertaking. <br/><br/>A situation we have a very clear procedure for is checking for traps and secret doors. The player describes what the character is doing, and if that would probably discover the door or trap, I tell them about it, no roll required. If there's a chance they'd notice the trap or door while they're doing whatever it is (for example, they're checking for drafts but they might notice a loose stone), a roll-under Wisdom check will let them discover the trap or door. The die roll answers the question "how perceptive is this character in this situation?"<br/><br/>Liam,<br/><br/>Interesting. You're spot-on in terms of identifying the problem, but that solution sounds like a bunch more math than I'm happy with. It's worth noting that I am very lazy.<br/><br/>Ideally I'd like a table that compared HD totals to work out a baseline of hits/kills to distribute among each group, and then a d6 roll or something to randomly increase or decrease that number.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377227/#Comment_377227" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T17:03:27+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  5:03PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>  For solo games I use the Chainmail troop type combat.

Sounds like we're on the same page in terms of the problem, but I'm a little less willing to put in the work to get so slick with the regular combat mechanics. I can recall from my days of 3e D&amp;D being able to run through a combat with a half-dozen characters fighting twenty or more opponents, and blast through rounds in under a minute, easy. But in those days we were very interested in those combats, being a test of the players' character-optimization choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377273/#Comment_377273" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T06:15:59+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  6:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>  I'll see if I can post a more detailed thingy later today. Oh and another thing about using Chainmail style dice. You can reduce combat down to just one round if you want. Basically winner takes all. You can give extra dice for fictional positioning and/or -1 pip on some dice, etc.... I really need to write this up.

               So Chainmail type combat:<br/><br/>In the example I linked to I used the basic Troop type. There is a table that shows when you get a hit vs a troop type.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>Heavy Foot vs. Light Foot - Hvy Foot scores hits on 5 and 6s<br/>Light foot returns hits only on 6's<br/><br/>Pretty straight forward. You simply spread the hits across all those engaged or just declare the side that has the most hits a winner. Morale rules really should be used too. This is ok.... but<br/><br/>I like this way better:<br/>Each character has a number of Hit Dice as in dice rolled to hit. The players can then put forth how many dice they want to use in combat, basically how invest are they in the combat. Fictional positioning can add or subtract dice or you can assign +/- 1 pip as circumstances dictate. <br/><br/>So for classes you can make the Fighter more fighty by doing the following:<br/>Fighters always roll an extra die and keep the highest, when fighting<br/>or if you want  high fantasy<br/>Fighters always roll an extra die when fighting<br/><br/>Thief<br/>Can gain a die when they position themselves to strike unseen<br/><br/>Magic Users<br/>Have the option of placing dice in the combat pool if they want the risk, otherwise they can rain down death from afar. <br/><br/>There was some initiative thingy we did too. You could buy initiative with your Hit Dice to strike first or do something before all the shit hit the fan. <br/><br/>Another thing we played with was that fighters hit on a 5,6 and everyone else on a 6 until level 3. <br/><br/>Downside to this:<br/>No funny shaped dice. This can be a big deal! Seriously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377398/#Comment_377398" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T19:51:00+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  7:51PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ara,<br/><br/>That is all excellent and super relevant. I hear you on the funny dice, too!<br/><br/>In my hack classes each have a fixed damage value (fighters d8, scholars d6, thieves d4), so we could say something like "roll your level in damage dice, 4+ is a hit on the other side" or something. Then I'd let theives do something nifty like choose to not take their share of hits.<br/><br/>Plus of course, like you say, adding in extra crunch as we need to for fictional positioning, strange circumstances and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377399/#Comment_377399" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T19:53:10+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  7:53PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/> That's pretty cool.

As a player you know that you hit that skeleton pretty good with your mace... but he also hit you pretty good with his claws.  How close to death are you?  You'll find out if you die.<br/></blockquote>\nPlayed like this for a few D&amp;D sessions and a couple of Unknown Armies campaigns: making all rolls and never even showing the players the character sheets. Some very memorable games that we still talk about today, and I never found it to much hassle as GM. But not sure you'd get what you wanted. We got back to awesome fictional descriptions with this method, as this was the only way the players felt they could affect the world. This did make combat more interesting but not faster.<br/><br/>These days I prefer something that connects rules and fiction more concretely, but this is how my groups think Unknown Armies works, so we may do it again.<br/><br/>The simpler option could be the Unknown Armies standard approach: DM secretly managing HP totals for PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16464/d-d-melee-rules" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16464/d-d-melee-rules" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16464/d-d-melee-rules/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16464%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16464%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
