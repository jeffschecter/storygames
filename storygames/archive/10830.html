It was so much fun that I bought an ethereal iphone just to play it.  It's basically Mechaton + Pokemon + Magic: TG, which clearly means it's crack cocaine, though I don't think you could convince Lego to jump on board, which probably means it's stuck being "conceptual art."<br/><br/>When you start the game (or start a new battle mech), you are randomly assigned a number of Lego pieces by the iphone app.  You can either assemble them into a mech / monster through drag and drop, or you can shake your iphone for it to assemble a creature for you.  Shaking the iphone again will use the same pieces but reassemble a different mech, so you can keep shaking it until you get a creature you like.<br/><br/>Once you have a mech, you can use it to fight your friends' mechs over the internet, with cute little animation and stuff.  Different mechs have different battle moves, but they're all fairly abstracted, like in Mechaton, where your Thunder Tail Roll and your friend's Boom Cannon might both be "2 Red" or whatever.  There's also a tabletop version of the fight rules, that can be played offline using actual Legos, with the iphone doing the equivilent of rolling dice for you.<br/><br/>Whoever wins the fight gets to <i>steal a virtual Lego piece from their opponent's mech and graft it onto their own</i>.  Consequently, victorious mechs gradually get bigger and bigger, more and more complicated. And the iphone app actually plots out evolutionary paths for your mech, based on the pieces you've acquired and the various changes you're allowed to make between fights.  Unlike the opening construction phase, the later construction is much more tightly scripted by the game.  <br/><br/>Perhaps spoils that you can't use in construction right away go into a resource pool and the app will actually tell you what other pieces you need to acquire before you can, say, attach that steam shovel to your mech.  I don't know, though, this is beginning to get beyond what the dream covered. Probably, too, once you have a truly badass mech, since there's nothing guaranteeing parity will be maintained, you can fight multiple other mechs at the same time or fight in little groups of 3-5 mechs a side in an effort to get a relatively even fight.<br/><br/>Anyway, thought I'd share.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240114/#Comment_240114" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-02T08:11:28+00:00" title="November  2, 2009  8:11AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone needs to make this.

Obviously, randomly picking from a list of "feet," "torsos," and "heads" is going to be easier than trying to procedurally build "a robot" out of generic parts.<br/><br/>In any case, your first task is to make a game where two people can fight each other with the same robot, which has fixed values for everything. Once that's fun, you can work on the robot builder, and the improvement/xp system, since nobody will care about those unless the combat is any good. And then playtesting and balancing. With the right team of people working full time, you could probably release something in under a year, if you were comfortable keeping it all 2d.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240222/#Comment_240222" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-02T22:23:13+00:00" title="November  2, 2009 10:23PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>The "steal a piece from your defeated foe" sounds like a Death Spiral, which might also lead to players dropping out of unfinished matches as soon as they realize they're losing.

You know how that have those "pods" of set pieces with multiple different things you can build out of them?  I think it was based on that sort of concept.

So, even if you lose pieces, you can always fight with other "starting level" mechs, nomatter what.  Maybe only once you're down to less than a dozen blocks will your mech be recycled into a new mech.  Even then, maybe you can get some of your old mech's "scrap" as extra starting pieces in your sideboard, just like creating a new character in Agon or Hero's Banner after the death of an old one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240259/#Comment_240259" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-03T09:08:03+00:00" title="November  3, 2009  9:08AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, how are you imagining getting from blocks to mech level stats?

It has a BIT of a death spiral, like any game with attrition-of-resources-to-fight mechanics. But it provides a bit more tactics than rock, paper, scissors (which has longer-term strategy, too, FYI).<br/><br/>Maybe somehow make the type of attachment determine what attack and defense options are available, and use something like roshambo (or similar "Circle of Death" like Earth, Fire, Water, Metal, Wood) to determine each rounds net outcome (both damaged, neither, only one). And as in Mechaton, damage costs attachments. Throw in a randomizer (or make another "attachment" class: Pilot Skill) for tie-breaking.<br/><br/>Another thing: enable Bluetooth discovery of folks with the game running. So not only can you play "online" (via servers that establish peer-to-peer links, I reckon) but folks could also be able to ping for other players nearby, request a battle, and maybe even have a way to signal who's who (flash the screen, which the signaller holds up and pans around the crowd?).<br/><br/>(And, yeah... I've wanted to build a J2ME + Bluetooth/IR game like this for a WHILE.

Then there are some relatively generic limbs that you can build using any pieces you want that give you fairly generic (but still generally competitive) powers and stats.  So, if you want the steam-shovel arm that can knock your opponent down, you need a very specific set of parts (and may risk losing those parts if you compete with it), but if you just want to blast them with a laser cannon, you can build your cannon out of just about anything.<br/><br/>Also, I'm digging Timfire's thoughts on forced trading.
