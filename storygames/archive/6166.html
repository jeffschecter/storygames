If the players are implicitly contained in everything, then it shouldn't hurt to make that explicit, right?  I'm starting to have a strong feeling that keeping the players implied rather than stated is hiding some important bits.<br/><br/>EDIT: Specifically, I think it's hiding interactions between group members.  The Big Model seems to take "the players" as group, that do this Social Contract thing <i>as a group</i>, that Explore <i>as a group</i>, and so forth.  To a certain extent, grouping the players together hides the real nature of what's going on:  a bunch of individual people are sitting down and interacting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137182/#Comment_137182" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T11:39:33+00:00" title="March 31, 2008 11:39AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2008 11:45AM by Jesse.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max,<br/><br/>Can you specify the kind of thing you're looking for?  Yes, the group is a bunch of individuals.  The model describes what the group is meeting *for*. And layers of processes by which that thing happens.<br/><br/>For example Creative Agenda doesn't happen on the part of an individual (beyond an individual person's preference for enjoyment when a specific agenda actually does happen).  It's a thing which is realized over time through each individual's contribution plus other's appreciation and reaction those contributions.  The central thing, idea, source of pleasure, whatever you want to call it, that the group is mutually appreciating, contributing to, and reinforcing is the Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137185/#Comment_137185" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T11:49:41+00:00" title="March 31, 2008 11:49AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...no, not exactly.

I've played pick up games of volleyball on the beach in Santa Monica.  I've noticed there are two broad types: The folks with a competitive edge who want to play the rules; and the "party volleyball" people who just want to knock the ball around (even if that means hitting it 10 times on one side of the net -- which is a big no-no by the rules.)<br/><br/>These two groups don't play well together. They arrive to do a thing called "volleyball," but have different agendas within that activity.  They often frustrate each other (in obvious ways).  Now anyone can play either way, and if everyone knows what they're getting into before the game starts there usually isn't a problem.  But if people are having a tug of war about what kind of game their playing, it gets frustrating.  So, if people knowing what kind of volleyball game they're playing is "group think," give me a membership card to <i>1984</i>-Land.<br/><br/>Max, I don't know if you're seen the 2004 diagram that goes with the Big Model, but for me it's a clear illustration of how it's all about a bunch of individuals are doing something as a group -- but as individuals <i>first</i>.<br/><br/>The notion that sometimes people <i>don't</i> function in complete accord with one another is, frankly, what prompted Ron's work in the first place.  His concern has always been: How are the people at the table interacting with the other people at the table.  All the Big Model does is say, "Hey, here's the stuff everyone's going to be doing together as people when they play an RPG together."  It doesn't assume either a functioning group or a not functioning group.  It just says, "Here are the components and activities.  By being aware of them and laying them out on the table, we can make choices and not assume anything."<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/bigmodelpic.pdf"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137203/#Comment_137203" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T12:37:20+00:00" title="March 31, 2008 12:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, it's a PDF, you can't insert it as a picture.<br/><br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/bigmodelpic.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/bigmodelpic.pdf</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137205/#Comment_137205" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T12:44:23+00:00" title="March 31, 2008 12:44PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2008 12:47PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Guy.<br/><br/>Strange, my browser must be doing something funny, because it shows up on my screen in the post just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137207/#Comment_137207" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T12:53:45+00:00" title="March 31, 2008 12:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris has got it pretty straight. But, from another perspective, the original poster is correct in that Ron has clarified that, in fact, TBM is completely unconcerned with things like, "Why player A is playing." It does, in fact, look at roleplaying as a group activity... which it is. Basically TBM says that the personal reasons for play really do not so much matter, as long as they mesh with the overall group reason to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, at the social level, I may be playing because I like Mary. Mary may be playing because she was invited, and likes accepting invitations. Two very different reasons, but the results are not incompatible. On the other hand, if Mary is coming because she feels obliged by invitations, but doesn't really like the activity at hand, we may have a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Creative Agenda level, I may be playing because I like to show off how well I can direct my character to slay orcs. And Mary is playing to show off how well she can do resource management. And this may well be compatible. But if Mary instead wants to play in order to consider her character's very deep feelings about slain orcs, maybe we'll have trouble (note, maybe). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reasons why we play are as varied as the multitudinous individuals who play RPGs. Creating a model that accounts for every single player motivation is both pointless and impossible. What TBM does do is to look at how the *behavior* of individual players is either compatible or incompatible with that of others. Observably. That is, the GNS distinctions, as types of Creative Agendas, exist to demark points where people have observed that problems in compatibility tend to show up. Just for agenda, and just for one sort of difference, in the case of GNS. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the model gives us a way to discuss the differences between varying sorts of play behaviors, and how well they may work together synergistically, or where the pitfalls may lie. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it's not about individual RPG players alone, but about how groups of players interact, positively and negatively. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play RPGs solo, then TBM does not apply.

Another example:  five person game.  Each scene has only a subset of those people.  The same scene will obviously turn out differently if different characters are in the scene, but it will also turn out differently if different players play the same characters.  This depends on each players motivations and style and so forth, which I grant are hard to model.  But there's a further thing buried in there that TBM actively obscures:  if only a subset of the players are involved in a scene, the Social Contract between those players may be different than between the group as a whole.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Max, I don't know if you're seen the 2004 diagram that goes with the Big Model, but for me it's a clear illustration of how it's all about a bunch of individuals are doing something as a group -- but as individuals<i>first</i>.</blockquote>\nI've spent a <i>large</i> amount of time studying the Big Model classics, including this diagram.

His concern has always been: How are the people at the table interacting with the other people at the table.  All the Big Model does is say, "Hey, here's the stuff everyone's going to be doing together as people when they play an RPG together."  It doesn't assume either a functioning group or a not functioning group.  It just says, "Here are the components and activities.  By being aware of them and laying them out on the table, we can make choices and not assume anything."</blockquote>\nNot acting in complete accord with each other breaks the model.  There can no longer be monolithic "The Social Contract," but there may in fact be many pieces of Social Contract between individuals.

I mean, I'm looking at "romance," "transportation," "authority" "credibility" "narration" "stance" and more.  That stuff can only be done <i>by</i> people, interacting with other people.  Nothing there <i>exists</i> without the people.  And they exist as individuals interacting with individuals as well as the group.  "romance"? "transportation"? "initiative"?  Not all of that is going to be one person interacting with the whole group at one time.  Right?<br/><br/>But I didn't mean to imply you hadn't seen it or you haven't slogged through this stuff.  When you speak of a "monolithic social contract" my reaction -- "Really? There's a monolithic social contract?  I never thought of it that way before."  And because I don't think of the model suggesting that (and so no reason why it does) I simply am not getting snagged on something that's snagging you with it.  I'm not saying your concern isn't valid. I'm saying I look at that diagram and ask, "Where does it say everyone has worked out everything else with everyone else?"  I suppose one <i>could</i> look at it that way.  But I don't.  (Again, I'm more than willing to assume that Peter and Nancy might have their own romance thing going and no one knows about it yet, or that Lisa and Jennifer were talking one day and decided on their own to bring grilled veggies.)<br/><br/>The idea that the model assumes that there's one thing going on.... well, I've heard lots of people say things about it that I've never gotten from it. This is one of them, and again, like I said, cool.  Sounds like your hunting something down.  I hope succeed.

There's all kinds of stuff that we can talk about that involves individual players -- where is it on the picture?  How does it structurally relate to the other parts of the model?  The more I think about that, the more I look at the "the Big Model" as "a decent-sized model with a bunch of random crap thrown in so it looks comprehensive."  That's not a knock on the content, which is great in many regards, but it is a knock on the organization of that content, which is to say: there really ain't much organization of all that extra random crap.  And I think I know why it's not organized too!  Because there's no room for individual player stuff in the overall structure of the model!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137233/#Comment_137233" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T14:19:05+00:00" title="March 31, 2008  2:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2008 2:22PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jesse,<br/><br/>Again, I question if there is a "monolithic" social contract.  I think this is one of those things where we say, "Well, this makes no sense.  Look, it says there's a monolithic social contract, and clearly there can't be one."<br/><br/>To which I would say, "Absolutely correct. There can't be one."  <br/><br/>But I'm looking at the diagram. I'm seeing the top level as "Social Contract Stuff" -- not an actual social contact that the members of the group have all laboriously hammered out agreed to use for all interactions as a group.  So, I don't see there diagram saying there is a contract.  I'm saying that at that top level there's a bunch of stuff that is negotiated between players (not just player to group) that exists in the field of social contract stuff.  That's an important distinction, and might have something to do with why we're seeing the diagram so differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137234/#Comment_137234" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T14:21:43+00:00" title="March 31, 2008  2:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>Because there's no room for individual player stuff in the overall structure of the model!</blockquote>\nHi Max,<br/><br/>Again, I get you're seeing it that way.

But the level of abstraction is a killer.  The individuals have largely been abstracted out of the picture, and we end up with Social Contract, and Exploration, and Techniques.  I <i>know</i> that there must be people doing these things, but the structure of the model doesn't tell me <i>how</i>.  Why  not?  The structure would need to directly include the players in order to speak with any level of detail about their interactions.<br/><br/>There's a parallel with how people talk about countries.  We say "The United States" and somehow that's subtly different than the "the people of the United States."  There actually is a difference between looking at it top down and looking at it bottom up.

CK and Jesse, what I hear you saying is that even though players aren't actually interchangeable atoms, their variations aren't significant on the scale that the model is working at.  You can leave the variations to the realm of particular examples rather than incorporating the differences between players into the more abstract level of the model itself.  <br/><br/>The problem with that is that it draws attention away from the fact that players are not equal, interchangable bits.  There are power dynamics between players that aren't very well suggested by the term "social contract," because they're not necessarily intentional or consensual.  Or if they are, certain players have more clout in (re)negotiating the social contract than others do.  Other power dynamics are emergent: if I'm talking about game to two players who aren't talking much about game to each other, I may have more influence in maintaining or disrupting the game's status quo.  <br/><br/>I assume I'm not the first one to bring this up.  Given that a number of Forge games have mechanics that seem intended to protect (certain kinds of) equality between (some) players and tend to look at conflict mechanics as ways of negotiating between player interests (?), I assume I may be wrong in seeing power dynamics as de-emphasized in the Big Model.  But I haven't been around long enough to see this stuff discussed, so I'm curious about what seems to be a mismatch between what the model draws attention to and other stuff that's come out of the Forge.

But there are specific points of contact where -- say, the RPGPundit and I -- would meet if we had to get together and play together. That's what the Big Model covers.<br/><br/>Now, just because the Big Model lists those points, does that mean the RPGPundit and I would have an easy time of it?  No, of course not. And let me be clear -- no.  <br/><br/>But are we really expecting something that can fit on a web page to not only list those points of contact, but also explain how two people with such different temperaments about games, life and how one communicates with people are going to successfully navigate in a game together (if such navigation is possible at all?)<br/><br/>Again, I don't see how anything (power dynamics, in this case) are de-emphasized.  The Big Model doesn't say, "This is how things work when they're working well."  Its says, "All this stuff is going on <i>all the time</i> -- whether it's going well or not."  Issues of romance, food, who gets to talk when, who long someone talks -- all of it -- it's always happening whether to good effect or ill.  That is the emphasis.  <br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken (and I might be), this where there some cognitive dissonance (for me at least) is coming from.  I might be mistaken, but some people seem to be thinking that Big Model is saying, "Do this, and all is well."  And then, rightly, they add, "But that's not enough!"<br/><br/>To which I would reply, "Yes, but that's not what the model is saying.  It isn't saying, 'This is how you make a good game session run.'  The model is saying, 'This is happening.  Acknowledge it, own it, and make decisions about it.  Because this stuff happen in an RPG not matter what -- and it will either work well for your group, or badly.'"<br/><br/>And while I applaud anyone who wants to make the effort to nail all the other stuff down to somehow make sure Christopher Kubasik and the RPGPundit would have a good time together at a gaming table, I call that practical application of getting that stuff right "Life" and think it's a really, really big topic.  It depends on variables and behaviors of human beings -- who are crazy complicated in terms of taste, history, expectations, and the almost alchemical mixing of one person with another when they meet in the same room.  It's everything about life from marriages, to class rooms, to the work place, to dating and so on.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to stop anyone from going down that road.  I'm just saying, that's not what the model sets out to do -- and it doesn't attempt to do it, in my opinion, for good reasons.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137264/#Comment_137264" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T19:23:28+00:00" title="March 31, 2008  7:23PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2008 7:25PM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>If I'm not mistaken (and I might be), this where there some cognitive dissonance (for me at least) is coming from.

I'm not saying discussing stuff like methodologies for getting people creatively on the same page is futile.  I think I AM saying that whatever it is you are discussing will fall WITHIN the Big Model somewhere and not be an addition to it.  Like taking any of the big categories (Social Contract, Ephemera, Techniques, etc) and zooming in on them.<br/><br/>Doing that is a GOOD idea.  There's stuff like that all over The Forge (and here) all the time.  Like the poorly named "GM Tasks" which aren't part of the model but are part of Zooming in on Techniques of The Big Model.<br/><br/>Discussing the effects of visual aids at the table?  Let's do it!  But it's still an application of Ephemera.<br/>Discussing what happens to the game when Bob and Jane's relationship is falling apart?  Awesome!  But it's still an application of the Social Contract.<br/><br/>We wouldn't be talking about something "not in the model" we would be talking about the specifics of things within an area of the model.  Which again is good!  We should be doing this.<br/><br/>Now does there exist whole new areas that WOULD constitute an addition to the model?  Maybe.

Again, I think this is a behavioral model, or at least one that takes certain motives for granted as a basis for beginging - so I don't see it as a counter-example.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if this is the sort of thing that Max is looking for (or something as limited in scope), then I think he has great prospects. I was then under the mistaken impression that he was trying to come up with a model that tried to take into account all possible player motivations. Something that I and others have tried with no success to date. Though even that's not to say that it's impossible, just that I'm highly skeptical, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, my point was far less that Max shouldn't investigate these things, than that expecting the Big Model to be something it doesn't intend to be is... well it's barking up the wrong tree. Yes, if you want to look at individual players, you're going to have to build a new model. <br/>\n<br/>\nGo for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137694/#Comment_137694" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T11:22:01+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 11:22AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Jesse and Mike are in agreement with Josh's useful clarification.  <br/><br/>I wanted to say, "Me, too."

That may have been the problem.  For clarification: Suppose you have an understanding within your group that you're going to treat each other a certain way, but despite the group's best intentions, no one can follow it for long.  Also suppose that not following it inherently advantages certain people and disadvantages others.  So some people get hurt, the understanding is reaffirmed, and the cycle repeats.  Is engaging in the undesirable interactions we haven't agreed on and are trying to prevent as much a part of the social contract as the interactions we've agreed on and are trying to foster?

Or, what about individual player preferences?  They can be negotiated into the Social Contract, but they also affect the course of play <i>while play is happening</i>.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Again, I don't see how anything (power dynamics, in this case) are de-emphasized.

To make a ridiculous analogy, we can talk about street lights in the context of a model of democracy, but there's no structure in the model that helps us do so.

But you're saying that labeling the whole social context as "social contract" really does imply that all behavior in a group is consensual?  <br/><br/>Treating all power dynamics as ultimately consensual undercuts the fact that they're power dynamics.  It's like saying that rape and abuse can't occur within a marriage, because marriage itself is a consensual relationship and if neither spouse has left it yet, then they've both agreed to that treatment.  There's some truth in that -- "Why haven't you left yet?" is an important question to ask.  But let's not say everything that happens up until the moment of departure is consensual.  And if something happens that forestalls departure, let's not make everything up to that point retroactively consensual.  Collapsing all of the other factors that lead people to accept unequal situations and then tacking on "but ultimately both parties are equal and it's all consensual" is pretty dismissive to the difficulties of people in those circumstances.  That kind of response also makes it harder to recognize how the victims' social identities and imagined spheres of action were produced through the context of unequal relationships.  And if everyone decides to stay, it's hard not to equate "it's all consensual" with "if you stay, you're accepting what's going on and therefore it's not really a problem for you, is it?"  In that sense, the reasons that it's a common mistake to think that the big model refers only to what happens when a game is going well isn't just a reader error.  It's an interpretive potential built into how the model is structured.<br/><br/>Admittedly the ties that keep people in their gaming groups are lighter than marriage, and the power dynamics that take place in gaming groups aren't exactly tantamount to rape.  But lumping these sorts of abuses together under the heading of 'agreed upon social contract' trivializes them in the same way.  There's an ideological component there regarding personal responsibility -- it's maybe not a very controversial one in the case of gaming, but it is there.  <br/><br/>If you take the consensual as your model for all social relationships within a game, the nonconsensual is deemphasized, and with it the players who repeatedly get the short end of the stick and whose experiences aren't a matter of unambiguous rational consent.  Clearly you can fit that into the big model if you want to.  But because here players appear only as inherently equal agents, the social contract level of the model seems to be more conducive to one analytic approach to the situation than others: Why haven't you been able to change your situation?  Why haven't you left yet?  <br/><br/>(Uh, that approach does have a lot to recommend it.  My point is just that it would give a certain slant to analyses of group dynamics, and if you agree with what I'm saying, that that slant represents a certain kind of disappearance of players.  But I'm making this argument mostly in an exploratory sense.  I don't really have any stakes in it, so don't feel obliged to reply unless it's an interesting discussion for you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137976/#Comment_137976" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T15:02:15+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  3:02PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really saying something more like:  The Big Model is sort of like a magnifying glass -- with it we can magnify the surface features of roleplaying a bit to see them, and maybe poke them around a bit.

Some of the prelims are over on KF under the title "Integral Model."  I'm revising now to remedy this player issue, which I'm maybe half-way done with, and waiting to hear Mendel's comments on it.

I don't think so, and that's why I formulated my Social-Play Model, which looks at play from the standpoint of interaction between players, playspace, and social contract.

But that's not like saying that it doesn't assume that they have any. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138215/#Comment_138215" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T14:07:11+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  2:07PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like I said, the players are implied everywhere, explicit nowhere.

Just do it, come up with your ideas, and we'll see what they mean, if anything, to the Big Model. My point is that they'll probably be interesting on their own, so why worry about whether or not they're fixing some problem in the Big Model or not? Does that matter?

I am not my identity anyway, so identity politics are rather immaterial.  I base my thought on the Big Model precisely because it is the most comprehensive picture we've got.  It's highly valuable for exactly that reason, and so it is unfortunate that questioning it paints me as a detractor.  I <i>like</i> the Big Model -- as a starting point.<br/><br/>Here are <a href="http://www.i-would-knife-fight-a-man.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=3148" rel="nofollow">some of my preliminary thoughts on revisions to the Big Model</a> (they're on KF, so they won't be accessible to all, but for now it will have to do.)  Two points: First, this whole train of thought has undergone massive revision for consistency over the past months, and so, if you spot problems, it's highly possible I've already addressed them.  With upcoming revisions, the document outlining my model should weigh in at around 30 pages or so.  Mendel's got it right now, and I hope to get his feedback in the near future; with that, it will be ready to be released into the wild.  Second, for the same reason -- the presentation I linked is outdated -- it doesn't include players explicitly.  I've just reached the conclusion that it needs to, so that's a revision still in progress.  Still, since we're dealing with orienting generalizations anyway, the basic method of including players goes like this:<br/><br/>There are a number of layers to this model, similar to the Big Model layers, but rearranged to reflect a hierarchy of dependence.  Because the higher layers depend on lower layers, if you remove a particular layer, you will destroy all higher layers without affecting any of the lower layers.  We can use this as a test to decide which layers are higher up (more significant) and which are lower down (more fundamental.)  The higher layers depend on, and thus include, the lower layers.  I'll forgo a discussion of why I believe each thing depends on the previous for the moment, and simply present the hierarchy I arrived at:<br/><br/>(most fundamental, least inclusive)<br/>Foundation (contains Social Contract, goals, permissions and expectations, and other stuff)<br/>Ephemera (contains moment to moment statements, actions, feelings/responses, and so forth)<br/>Authentication (contains System and other stuff)<br/>Exploration (contains "the fiction" and the SIS and other stuff)<br/>Constellation (contains patterns expressed in fiction -- one of the CA definitions)<br/>(most significant, most inclusive)<br/><br/>You may be wondering "Why does he keep saying 'and other stuff'?"  I've applied a four quadrant split along "individual/collective" and "inside/outside" axes to each of these layers, and many quadrants simply do not have Big Model equivalent terms.  Regardless, you only get moment to moment statements once you make some agreements about how to play, you only authenticate fictional elements into our shared imagining on the back of statements that are made, you only get fiction by using some authentication (System), and you only get patterns like "simulative value" or "addressing a premise" as a pattern in the fictional events that occur.  There's much more to the dependence between layers because there's much more to the layers, but each one does indeed depend upon the previous.<br/><br/>Now, where are the players?  Well, it's strikingly simple.  Each thing in the Foundation layer depends on the players, so the players must be more fundamental.  There is no Social Contract if you remove the players, because the players underlie the Social Contract.  That means that players are "contained" in Foundation, in Ephemera, in Authentication, and so forth.  So the relationship between players as individuals is a horizontal relationship in the "Player level" at the most fundamental end, while a player's relationship to a statement they make (an Ephemera) is a vertical containment relation.  This goes a long way to explaining why players have different perspectives on the statements that are made too: one of the players has their own internal subjective perspective because they are literally inside the Ephemera, while the others are viewing only its outside surface.  I believe including players in this fashion will lead to further insight regarding perspectives -- or considering perspectives will lead to further insight into players.  Probably both.<br/><br/>That's a radically condensed version of what I've been working on, but perhaps a taste will convince you that I'm not just randomly bashing the Big Model to further my own identity-political agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138553/#Comment_138553" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T10:35:47+00:00" title="April  7, 2008 10:35AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry if I am missing a lot of background here, but can someone help me out?

Let me give you an example of each:<br/>\n<br/>\nDesign: As we disected the parts of play that included "who does what" in terms of GM roles and player roles with regards to the model, a colleague of mine (Ralph Mazza) and I came up with a reapportionment of authority in our design of a game called Universallis. We wouldn't have thought to do this reapportionment had we not had the model (and it's attendant discussions) to refer to in terms of thinking about how play happens between the players. These discussions revolved around questions of things termed with Jargon like "Authority" and "Credibility" etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding Problems: Everyone has had the experience (recently referenced in another thread) where "The Assasin kills The Palladin" much to everyone's disgust. The problem here is what's termed "incoherence" of play styles. In understanding what the players are individually after, we can see how the conflicts occur between the players in the example cases. And, yes...<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting Expectations: if you understand these issues you can set expectations so that player interests to not conflict. You can do this through what the model calls techniques or ephemera, but you can also incentivize these things mechanically, and we're back to supporting design again. <br/>\n<br/>\nVocabulary: in any case these concepts are difficult to discuss. And previous jargon is badly flawwed ("Roll-playing vs Role-Playing). These models hopefully provide a non-loaded jargon that facilitates understanding amongst those that understand the jargon. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many other advantages, too. I can tell you that, prior to understanding my own play proclivities, I had no idea what techniques I should be using to promote the sort of play that I like. And, since discovering these techniques, my play has gone from causing introspective bouts of self-doubt about whether RPG play and I were compatible, to being absolutely in love with it every time I play. Erasing two decades of problematic play from my soul. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can't tell you how valuable that's been. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that jargon also neccessarily alienates people who do not understand the jargon, especially where it looks like it has an easily understood meaning, but does not. That's an unfortunate side-effect, but one that our community (and I mean the Forge community of theorists mostly) have been willing to put up with in order that we be able to communicate more effectively. We suffer through attacks that range from labeling us elitist to saying that we have an ivory tower mentality (or, worse, cult), but, oh well. People who don't find it productive should just ignore us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't care what we "sound" like, I just like that these models help us understand play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm very much looking forward to what Max comes out with. Or any theorist. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Where are the players? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6166/where-are-the-players/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Where are the players? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6166/where-are-the-players/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="The new Jargon in turn, turned into loaded words.

That's exactly what I was looking for -- examples that let me see how the model gets grounded in real-world experience. Models by definition are simplifications. And there are uncountably many ways in which to simplify.  Without a guide, I believe it is easy to simplify right down to the point of irrelevance ("how many angels can dance on the head of a pin"), so I think verification against actual experience is critical to model design.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that it helps in communication.  I suspect more people would be interested in theory, and get involved in discussions (and provide their own real-world examples or counter-examples), if there were more concrete descriptions of how particular models improved design or play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteven                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138688/#Comment_138688" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T09:42:03+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  9:42AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: steven807</cite>if there were more concrete descriptions of how particular models improved design or play.</blockquote>\nThere won't be many <i>concrete</i> examples until someone writes an injunctive model, one that says "Do this, and you will experience this."

A theory isn't testable unless it makes a falsifiable <b>prediction</b>.  Hence my focus on injunctive models -- they may be less detailed than what we've already got, but they're <i>testable</i> and revisable on the basis of experience.  Using that approach, we can figure out if we're building on a solid base, or just a base that appeals to our own individual prejudices.  Then we can expand to bigger and bigger, more and more inclusive scopes.  That helps to avoid the semantic argument problem that plagues so much theory discussion:<br><br>"No, my definition is better."<br>"No, it's not."<br>"Yes, it is."<br>"Prove it."<br>"This is just a descriptive model, none of it can be proved."<br/>"..."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138850/#Comment_138850" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T09:35:53+00:00" title="April  9, 2008  9:35AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though some would disagree with the assessment, I think that the Big Model has, in fact, held up quite well against falsification. These are the standards that Professor Edwards adheres to. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the big problem is that there's little in the way of collected empirical data. So one could charge that the theory hasn't been tested well from that POV. But that doesn't seem to be forthcoming any time soon (no money in it, you see), so I wouldn't hold my breath for that sort of validation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point we have to rely largely on our own experiences to validate the model. And, again, all I can tell you, for whatever it's worth, is that it's been hugely useful to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote, too, that my comment about how it helped was indirect only because it would take a long time to explain the very direct way in which the Big Theory and it's discussion lead to the discoveries in question. I assure you that it was very direct, and I can, if you absolutely must challenge the assertion, provide you with details as to how (documented). I hope you'll take my word for it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's another point of view that I should elucidate. When on the Forge, I and some others there attacked a group of other theorists for providing what we saw as impractical additions to the theory. "Well, maybe," we'd say, "But so what? What does that matter? How can I use it in play?" To which the response was an intelligent, "Well, maybe it won't lead anywhere... but maybe such veins of discussion will eventually have unforseen relevance and usefullness to RPG play." And they also responded, "And it also might be useful outside of RPG play, as we relate RPG play to other stuff." <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... while my personal pecadillos are that I'm only strongly interested in theory that seems to have an immediate and direct impact on RPG design and play (play, really, inasmuch as design is meant to promote good play), I can accept that some theory might not have that value for me, and still be valueable to others. So I don't criticize it any more. Though I may ignore it at times. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this gives you an insight into the perspective of people like myself and the rest of the community of theoreticians who were around when the Big Model was being created. To suppose that it's an ivory tower theory seems entirely upside-down to me. In fact, the theory forum was closed at the Forge because too many people theorized in a vaccuum of "what if" instead of looking at what happens in actual play. So all theory discussions were moved to the Actual Play forum, just to entertain our desires to keep the dicsussion practical and grounded in at least as much observation as we have available to us. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's nothing "Airy-fairy" about the Big Model.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138855/#Comment_138855" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T10:16:11+00:00" title="April  9, 2008 10:16AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>There's nothing "Airy-fairy" about the Big Model.</blockquote>\nI half-way agree.

If you start with Actual Play, and generalize from there, you get something quite different than if you start with a theory and <i>then</i> go play to check it out.  Neither of those approaches is better, and I don't believe we can do without either one.  It's a cycle: Theory =&gt; Prediction =&gt; Direct Experience =&gt; Theory.  You can rearrange those however you like, so long as the cycle stays the same, but some starting points yield different sorts of results than others.  That's why I find the theory forum closure unfortunate: "what if?" is a great question, so long as you can go check the "what if."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh" title="Gorsh"><img alt="Gorsh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh">Gorsh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139280/#Comment_139280" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T10:12:07+00:00" title="April 11, 2008 10:12AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2008 10:25AM by Gorsh.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While i\xb4m all for practical applications ( make actual playing better ) and falsifiable testing ( make the theory better... or make it die trying ), why isn\xb4t "understanding" a sufficient reward for theory development?

But my point is that if there isn\xb4t a <i>do</i> to follow from the theory, and it ( or one of the ramifications of it ) still gives us understanding, then it\xb4s still a success to me.<br/><br/>The example for this is History, in what makes it analytical, explanatory, and not a mere collection of facts. How does better understanding a long past process ( by creating a model of how the facts relate causally ) provides us with something to <i>do</i>? Only by stretching considerably what has been learnt we can say we can apply it to affect the present - after all and however alike both epoches be, we can\xb4t say "if that happened there, this will happen now" with any certainty... And neither can we produce injunction to "test" the model in the future, we can only dig out more documents that support or contradict the model, but never actually test it.<br/>And still, we create History theories in scientific ways and we value that knowledge for the understanding it provides us...<br/><br/>Anyway, i\xb4m on a devil\xb4s advocate mode of sorts here, as i do believe the Big Model has some injunctive power. The whole "system does matter" thing, if we take it as part of the model, can be tested in terms of effectiveness of methods, i.e. using systems made <i>for</i> and <i>against</i> a certain outcome and see if players willing to produce that outcome have an equally hard or easy time or not. ( That alone would be awesome, if only to shut all those "any game with any system" mouths for good. ) ... But i had to pull the thing away of what i think is an excessive emphasis on practicality.<br/><br/>You know, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139332/#Comment_139332" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T15:08:09+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  3:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2008 3:08PM by steven807.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I brought in the practicality aspect, specifically because a concern I have with "understanding" as a goal.  "Understanding" is great, but since models are abstractions, there are an infinite number of models that can be made of a given domain.  The point of grounding things in the real world is to make sure that of the infinite # models, this one is relevant.<br/><br/>I think History is the wrong analogy, since historians don't make up a model world and study it; they study the real world.<br/><br/>Instead, imagine a biologist, speculating on how the humors of the body might interact with the four Elements.  He could bring in all sorts of sophisticated thinking about how ulcers are due to a preponderance of Fire in the yellow bile, etc.  Other biologists might be fascinated, and his arguments might well convince them that the world now had a better "understanding".  But if they ever attempt to ground the model in the real world, they would find flaws pretty quickly.  "Understanding" was illusory -- they understood their model, not the real world.<br/><br/>I find beautiful theories fascinating and seductive, but with limited time, I'm hoping to spend any RPG-theory-learning time I have available on ones that will actually make my play better.<br/><br/>And as I've said before, I also think communication is relevant: I believe any discussion of models becomes much more compelling when clarified through real-world examples.  Not examples of "situation X can be understood in terms of model Y", but "my play was improved by applying model Y in the following way".<br/><br/>Steven                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh" title="Gorsh"><img alt="Gorsh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh">Gorsh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139366/#Comment_139366" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T22:30:10+00:00" title="April 11, 2008 10:30PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2008 10:31PM by Gorsh.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have a few base ground differences regarding what\xb4s "real" in real world and what can be known... I\xb4d say that understanding wasn\xb4t illusory before the "Elemental biologist"\xb4s test, it\xb4s only after it\xb4s proven false that it fails. Newton\xb4s model of physics provided "understanding" for a long time before Relativity came to disprove it; i wouldn\xb4t call that understanding "illusory" because it ultimately failed to acomodate all facts.<br/>That\xb4s why i thought History - and not a more testable science - to be the right analogy: In History, we definitely <i>not</i> study the "real" world: we study "facts" from the past that we attempt to grasp through second-hand documents, and the ideal models that we use to try to acomodate them in a logical "if...then" way. And given that we don\xb4t even have the pocket societies to enforce our tests upon, i\xb4d say definitely historians study "model worlds": In one of them the model works as "rise of liberal intelectual doctrines -&gt;Argentina\xb4s independence from Spain", in other it works as "English-sponsored free-trade\xb4s pressure on monopolic port of Buenos Aires -&gt; Argentinian independence", in other as both at the time, and there could be many more... the historian\xb4s work is to test them with the known facts to see how well they work to explain them, and perhaps dig up further test to assert the model\xb4s validity: what they\xb4re doing is to study and compare the models, the real world they are refering to is buried and gone.<br/>( sorry for the Argie-centric examples, they\xb4re the ones i know )<br/> <br/>From the collection of existent models that <i>do</i> explain the facts in some way, we may favor to develop the ones that produce injunction, but only because those can be falsified by tests, therefore trimming the collection even further; but that doesn\xb4t make the others ( the non falsified AND the not falsifiable ) less "true"... yet. <br/><br/>In OUR case ( to avoid the Off Topicism of a pure episthemologic debate ), i think the Big Model, even if it truly were descriptive alone, it\xb4s a great advancement in the way we understand the social phenomena we call RPGs, as the "Element\xb4s theory of disease" would be in understanding disease if nothing else where there before it, as Newtonian physics were until disproven, etc. I say that if we favor other models ( as the expanded model proposed in this thread, or any other ) as more truthfully explaining the interactions they describe, it musn\xb4t be on the ease they can produce tests to themselves alone, but also on the degree of understanding they allow, and the ethical implications of acting upon them. <br/><br/>( <i>It might explain my point better to tell you that i\xb4m a teacher: in our field and given the "blackboxism" of human mind, the more testable theories of learning are the ones that try to accomodate more discrete facts in less complex ways - behaviourism and the ilk. To give up on harder-to-prove theories like Piaget\xb4s and Vigotsky\xb4s and Brunner\xb4s ( and... ) means both more falsifiable claims and less focus on aiming for significance and complexity, making that choice a really hard one to make. <br/>That\xb4s where i\xb4m coming from )</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6166/where-are-the-players" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6166/where-are-the-players" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6166/where-are-the-players/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6166%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6166%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
