(And before you say Apocalypse World, keep in mind that I don't own it and don't know much about it, so be prepared to explain <i>why</i> AW would be great.)<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with Disgaea, it's a series of video games set in a world of demons where moral values are inverted from those of humans. Pretty much everyone is selfish, murderous, conniving, and deceitful, and people generally vie for power constantly or scrabble for petty edges or seek to satisfy petty grudges and desires. This is okay because the games are humorous about it.<br/><br/>The games are class-based, and I'd like to preserve that somehow.<br/><br/>Character level is a thing, even a thing that <i>people in the setting</i> talk about. However, it's also very fluid, because levels are gained quickly, and you can always reincarnate at level 1, and there's several other instances where people find their levels altered. So an actual experience track and whatnot doesn't seem appropriate; your level should rather be just another attribute or trait, somehow.<br/><br/>I dunno.

You have a few different Traits, which represent Classes you've trained in, the score determining the dice you get to roll (in addition to the initial die). Your level, like suggested, determines if you get any bonus or penalty based on the level of your opponent. Items could functionally be level bonuses for specific actions, instead of adding directly to a Trait (essentially, they're evening the odds more than providing a direct bonus). And have conditions that are appropriate for a video game, like "Low on Hit Points," "Magic Break," "Aggro," or something like that.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>Oh, and from what I remember, I concur that Yeld would be probably be good as well.

With this, you can make the Brawler distinct from the Fighter, the Mage distinct from the Healer, the Ninja different than the Scout, all by how you choose your abilities. Everything starts with 1 point (the base 1D6 die), and distribute another, oh, let's say 10 points among them?<br/>Alert - ability to notice and search<br/>Charm - ability to persuade and influence<br/>Fight - ability to hit with weapons and bare hands<br/>Guard - ability to shrug off attacks<br/>Magic - ability to cast spells or special effects<br/>Resist - ability to ignore spells or special effects<br/>Shoot - ability to use ranged attacks and weapons<br/>Sneak - ability to move silently and hide<br/>Speed - ability to evade and chase<br/>Tough - ability to lift heavy things and resist poisons<br/>Treat - ability to heal others<br/>Trick - ability to distract or mislead<br/><br/>Each point in an ability above one gives you access to certain weapons or effects. Like, if you had Magic 4, you would choose 3 spell effects that you could cast. Or if you had Fight 3, you would choose two types of weapons you can equip.<br/><br/>Your level would determine what you would need to roll for successes on your D6s. If you are evenly matched, you need to roll the regular 4-6 for successes. If you were a bit outmatched (enemy +1-+3 levels higher) you'd need to roll 5-6, or for really baddies (+4 or more levels higher) 6s. On the other hand, if you were +1-+3 levels higher than your opponent, you'd only need to roll 3-6 for successes, or if you completely overpower them (+4 level or higher), you'd only need 2-6s.<br/>And like I suggested before, items add to your effective level, instead of adding more dice. This is where your choices of abilities comes to be important, because if you can't equip the Demongod Sword +5, you can't use its bonus, right? Your Mage with a Fight of 1 who can only use sticks would not benefit from it, but a Warrior with a Fight of 4 and able to equip Swords, Axes, and Maces would have no problem.<br/><br/>Not sure how enemies would be handled just yet.

My mindset is always about taking bits and pieces from various things to make something new. That's just me.<br/><br/>Though really, with the Hackbird rules, and with enough of an understanding of the Disgaea classes and their specialties, you could still make it work as a rules-lite option. Have the Traits be the actual Classes (so maybe a character could have Fighter 3, Ninja 4, Cheerleader 2).<br/><br/>If you go the AW route, maybe look at the Minions Inc. hack first?

Gorgeous character design and great stories (as of the first anyway, I never got into the others of the series) punctuated by repetitive grid tactical combat with some quirkies (human stacking/trapeze etc). A grid tactical game with a lot of crunch... 4e really fits that bill well.<br/><br/>Anima Prime is tactical in a different kind of way, but I can kinda see it for this kind of game: Aim for the tactical play, and the cut scenes is where the dark humor/stories take place.<br/><br/>I worked on a tactical idea for a while, but unfortunately there were too many problems that creeped up:<br/>* The tactical balance was such that scenarios/battles had to be pretty much pre-made and not crafted on the fly.<br/>* Combat took too long.<br/>* Combat had too many numbers (the PS2/PS3 did all the calculations instantly, but at the table it was a lot of rolling and math)<br/>* In the console games, a TPK means "game over", I couldn't think of a way to make TPKs/failures interesting. <br/><br/>But if you think of a way, go for it!\n<blockquote><br/>I thought Yeld was meant to be more of a Square/Enix kinda thang?</blockquote>\nWell, what's the difference between Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea?

I like how Adell thinks he's human and acts accordingly, assuming that his strength is born from his indomitable human spirit -- when really, nope, he's a demon and <i>that's</i> why he's so strong (I also like that he never finds out that he's not human).<br/><br/>So, yeah, that's more of what I'm going for: that humor-rich exploration of the notion of "evil." That, and Prinnies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HerpestesFantasticus" title="HerpestesFantasticus"><img alt="HerpestesFantasticus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HerpestesFantasticus">HerpestesFantasticus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344030/#Comment_344030" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T12:12:58+00:00" title="September 26, 2011 12:12PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I see a lot of ideas about the setting in what you describe, but not really all that much about how you want it to play.

A comedy of manners?</p>\n<p>I would use IAWA, because I'd want a game of episodic adventures with conflicting interests, low motives, with an expanding world. Everyone having a terrible With Love seems to me to be exactly the thing I'd want, I'd probably make an extra rule that it had to be low.</p>\n<p>But, there's no reason you couldn't have a Fiasco playset set in the world you want to play in, and no reason you couldn't use Dogs in the Vineyard if you wanted to play a game about an organization enforcing the "Demons can't love" thing. Not all systems are setting-neutral, but there's no one right system for a given setting.</p>\n<p>If I wanted the story to be <em>about</em> setting, though, I'd hack apocalypse world.

This is okay because the games are humorous about it.</blockquote>\nWightbred is working on a Goblin World scenario for Ingenero that is very much like this. I am currently tossing out my current social challenge rules which are basically placeholders, and Im working now on the replacement which I am aiming at supporting this type of social interaction, amongst others.<br/><br/>The new social rules will be available in a week or two , and I suppose the GW module might be available in about 4 weeks.  There is enough info at my website for you to work out if you are intersted in it at all.  The Black Sun module will give you an idea of the amount of work you will have to do as GM to kick something off,although obviously your players might want to create their own PCs which saves a lot of work.<br/><br/><a href="http://ingenero.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ingenero.wordpress.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
