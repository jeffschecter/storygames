                    I just got back from a great plenary session at a conference that addressed <a href="http://www.seriousgames.org/" rel="nofollow">serious games</a>, and name-checked the <a href="http://www.seriousgamessummit.com/" rel="nofollow">Serious Games Summit</a>.<br/><br/> The speakers are all academics designing games to teach stuff - one guy is redesigning a microeconomics course to be taught entirely via a game interface.  Another guy runs a quarter million dollar patient simulator at Duke hospitals complete with interchangeable genitals that can discharge urine on command.  They are thinking about serious games in a serious way.  <br/><br/>And here's the thing - two of the biggest challenges they talked about are the loss of intangibles / non-verbal communication and selecting a level of granularity in support of specific pedagogies in computer-mediated gaming.  These are things that are easy to address at the tabletop.  <br/><br/>They talked about structural components in games, and duh, we've spent an ass-load of time thinking about this as a community.  Rules?  Representation?  Conflict?  Story?  Interaction?  Outcomes?  <br/><br/>One participant chimed in and dismissed serious games, saying that frivolous games (what we play, plus World of Warcraft I guess) have no consequences, which is the appeal.  When you add a grade to your performance, this luminary argued, you add a consequence and ruin the "game" of it.  I think he's dead wrong, but there you go.<br/><br/>Deeply interesting was the discussion of assessment, which is vital to this sort of enterprise (most of the people playing Serious Games are military, medical or - the leaders of the pack - aviation).  So they are into after-action reviews, scoring, repeatability, standardization, peer assessment, and so forth - some of which tabletop games do, and some of which they don't.  <br/><br/>It made me think about a role-playing game for medical students, complete with characters who grow and change and a narrative trajectory, with an attending physician as the GM.  You could extend this analogy to put the squad leader or instructor-pilot in the GM role.  It seems really interesting to me, particularly if you were to design a system to support Serious tabletop play that allowed subject matter experts to plug in the specifics of challenge, setting, and color.  <br/><br/>Would this work, assuming you overcame the absurd cultural hurdles?                </div>

                            Gaming also has some profoundly useful applications in the field of education.  My mom taught eighth grade history for about ten years, and she taught about half of the class using simulations -- so each table of students was a colony in the new world, managing resources and exploring their surroundings, and then later each table of students was a family in a wagon train heading for california, and so on.  These got <b>huge</b> student buy-in, and were very, very effective.  And then they got crushed by No Child Left Behind's standards-based curriculum, because the games weren't correlated to state standards.<br/><br/>I'm keeping an eye on the possibility of doing up a new batch of games, and perhaps a year-long suite of games, that build on developments in RPG theory as well as correlating to standards and all that rot.<br/><br/>Gaming is really powerful mojo; more powerful than I think we really give it credit for.  I'm eager to see what uses it can be put to.                        </div>

                            I thought about doing something similar for paddle sport guides to help them cope with a possible crisis, but couldn't see much advantage to adding characters that grow via a scoring system or a narrative trajectory vs. simple role-playing a situation.  This assumed that the players were trying to learn the skills taught by the game.  For example, in many Wilderness EMT courses they have one participant play the part of the injured person using fake blood, etc... then the students go through the motions on what to do.  I can't really see any advantage to rolling dice in a situation like that and feel that the actors would probably get more out of the live role-playing than a table top game scenario.  That said, a friend/former employee was a guide for many many years and he and his father used to play out scenarios each night in their tent on what they would expect could happen the next day on the mountain.  And he attributes his perfect safety record over 40 or so years in part to these role-playing experiences.<br/>
So, if I understand the question, I'd say that unless actual live role-playing is not available, I don't think that a tabletop role-playing game would be of much use for these types of exercises. That doesn't mean that I don't think it would be fun.<br/>

                            Jason, did you know I'm a professional roleplayer (when I'm not a medical secretary)? I get sent into 20 minute roleplays where, for example, a salesperson tries to sell me a product. They get observed and assessed.<br/>
<br/>
It's a fantastic way of seeing someone's skills in action. Slightly different from what you're talking about, but still interesting, I hope.<br/>
<br/>
Medical roleplays are a standard thing in the UK, by the way. The trainee doctor is assessed on their skills by how well they cope with an actor acting a patient.<br/>

                            Hey!  Conference!  Neat!  Which one was it?<br/><br/><code>One participant chimed in and dismissed serious games, saying that frivolous games (what we play, plus World of Warcraft I guess) have no consequences, which is the appeal. When you add a grade to your performance, this luminary argued, you add a consequence and ruin the "game" of it. I think he's dead wrong, but there you go.</code><br/><br/>I don't know who it was that was saying this, but you really do have to think carefully about adding real-world consequences to a game design.  If you're going to fail the class because you didn't do well enough in the game - and yes, I see a lot of serious game designs that basically suggest this - then are you really going to be able to explore and take risks?  I think that it's not that you can't design games that have real-world consequences, but that you have to consider and account for it in your design.<br/><br/>(I think the just-add-consequence-and-stir relates to the instinct that makes a lot of "serious game" designers build games that have only one correct path, and no options to play within the system.  I've played quite a few games like this and they are really shockingly didactic and boring.  Katie Salen, IIRC, gave a great talk about the dangers of 'propaganda' gaming at last fall's Games for Change conference, and I couldn't agree more.  Games don't do well if they have just one right answer - then you get flash-based web quizzes and the like.)<br/><br/>That said, I think that roleplaying games are a sadly overlooked approach to serious games that has a huge amount of potential.  One of my students just designed a media literacy role-playing game, for example, which is really innovative and smart.  (It uses advertisements as the resolution mechanic!)<br/><br/>JBR brings up a good point when talking about standards, though - and that also gets at the issue someone brought up in another thread, about teaching people how to RP.  How can we design games that create 'good enough' experiences to meet standards, when we can't control who is playing and we probably don't want to tie things down to the point of there just being one right thing to do?  GM-less games and encoding meaning in the rules of the game are two good places to start, but it's a no-pun-intended serious challenge.<br/><br/>JBR: if you design these games, are you going to design curriculum materials to go along with them?  What content area would they center around - history, like your mom's games?<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Resolution as assessment is bad, bad news.  However, the reward cycle is a good assessment in some contexts.  In others, where you really want to encourage that exploration of content, real assessment is probably best done outside of the game -- play the game, have fun with it, and then assess.  In the realm of education, this looks like "Play the game and learn the details of history, then take a test on the details and write a short response to the game experience."  Assessment is a pedagogical tool; it's not the whole of pedagogy itself.<br/>
<br/>
And while your point is a good direction to take the conversation, I was talking about content and performance standards (Students must learn the figurative language terms alliteration, metonymy, and assonance).  Standards are an essential element of assessment, though -- they give you a target by which to judge your success.<br/>
<br/>
Jess, when-and-if I do the games, I'll be producing teacher instruction materials and student materials (handouts, fact sheets, activities, whatever).  Their best application is cross-curricular (doing math to track the supplies of your historical wagon train then writing a diary entry), but I can certainly see focusing the games for use in a specific classroom.  The wagon train game  for history class would look very different than the wagon train game for math class.                        </div>

I spend a lot of time talking about and working on serious games (what with that being where half of my grad school money is coming from) and there are so many people out there who do not understand this simple point.  They just want to make <i>Math Blaster</i> again.<br/><br/>As for the standards thing, I didn't mean that we have to have standards for who is playing.  I mean that if the game is going to be judged by how it helps people achieve certain standards of content and performance, the design has to accommodate inexperienced players, grief players, poor players, people who don't know how to play (yes, there are a lot of them), etc., unless we're going to limit the population who are using the game in the first place.  This is hard.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>If you're serious about doing the games, let's talk privately - my program is looking for people who are taking alternative approaches to serious game design, and there might be some nice happy things (help, money, resources, publicity) in it for you if we get involved with the project in some way.

                            To expand on Graham's comment a bit, my girlfriend is a medical student (in the US) who did a lot of collaborative case study diagnosis in her first two years (right now she's jumped over to get her PhD before going back for her MD).  They actually had a class called ICS in which they met every two weeks (same teams, over the course of two years) to solve cases drawing on the concepts from their lecture courses.  They used either standard patients (actors) or simulated patients (robots) and roleplaying as part of the class.<br/>
<br/>
Two things she said in the email where she explained all this, just now:<br/>
<br/>
1)  "The incentives were grades; not failing was your reward."<br/>
2)  "I agree with he guy who said it stops being a game.  It is not fun when you are worrying about your grade or whether or not you kill someone.  That just pisses us off...why act like it is all 'fun and games' when you still get your ass chewed, lose valuable points, or kill someone if you take unwarranted risks or fuck up?"<br/>
<br/>
I'm just not sure there's a better reward mechanism, within the structure of med school, that could replace the grades thing.  "Bonus points," in a class already full of overachievers, just becomes another part of the grade treadmill.  And med school is exhausting enough already that students aren't going to play just for satisfaction, on their own time, even if (theoretically) such a game could replace some of the necessary reading.<br/>
<br/>
I think this has as much to do with the culture of med school as it does with the suitability of games to high-pressure learning, but then I'm not the one trying to save lives, I guess.                        </div>

                            Jess, it was the Duke <a href="http://cit.duke.edu/showcase/2006/" rel="nofollow">Instructional Technology Showcase</a>.  One of the games they highlighted was of the Math Blaster variety and really broke my heart.  The medical simulator guy seems to be on the right track - he's also collaborating with Virtual Heroes to do med sims for the Army.  He showed some clips from a special forces trainer that were very cool.<br><br>Re: consequences, I immediately thought of Counter-Strike, where there is an agonizing real-world consequence for failure - when killed, you get to sit and watch the remainder of the five minute round.  This totally sucks, BTW, if you are capped in the first twenty seconds.  It changes your behavior and game play, when contrasted with instant respawn games.  I agree that consequences need to be thoughtful, and if you are assessing based on in-game performance you need to be careful to think about learning styles and multiple ways to achieve goals.  <br><br>I'm very interested in serious games from a tabletop RPG lens.  Grey Ranks is starting to look like something you could play in a college classroom - still fun, but you end up learning a ton about the German occupation of Poland, the Rising in '44, the end of the war and the politics of the various parties, ideally without really meaning to as you try to keep your little dude alive and in love.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ever since Shreyas wrote Mridangam, I've been interested in writing a game that teaches players between 8-15 elementary Chinese characters per session.  In Mridangam, the players have to learn about 20 different hand gestures while preparing for play.  I'd be more interested in a model where you learned new characters as you went along.  And hopefully you could set things up so that new words were easily used with old words, so you'd be slowly building a usable vocabulary.  This could potentially be useful for both Chinese and Japanese language strudents (since everybody needs to learn Kanji).  But I see teaching games as rather different in practice than games intended for assessment.                        </div>

No, but it's a great way to assess someone's skills.<br><br>IMO, there's nothing wrong that whole "fail the class if you don't do well enough in the game" thing. I do roleplays at recruitment centres and, indeed, if the players do well in the roleplay - if they demonstrate the skills they're meant to demonstrate - they'll get the job. It's a fantastic way to see what someone's capable of. <br><br/>It's no longer a game in the same way, of course, in that you're not expected to take risks and get it wrong in order to learn. It's an exercise to see how well you do. But a very useful one.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></div>

<p>Interestingly, my girlfriend is spending this weekend in a training simulation / roleplay for the response to a catastrophic Hurricane event (her job is with a humanitarian research group). This is funny because she's affirmatively not a gamer, and yet she opened up her folder to see this huge packet labelled "ROLEPLAYING 101".</p>

I came to the same realisation when I saw some of the kits you can buy for this kind of thing (which sell for a couple of hundred quid and didn't look that hot). <br/><br/>The University I work for got some funding to investigate games and simulations as learning tools (tying in with our Virtual Learning). I went along to their seminar and it was a fascinating insight into possible markets for well designed roleplay in an educational setting. I'll dig out a few links if folks are interested.<br/><br/>So far my only followup has been forwarding a few easily transferable concept,  like Greg Stoltze's - Executive Decision to them. But I reckon there's a lot of possibilities out there.                        </div>

It would be interesting. They're often fairly confidential, though: especially those that rely on a participant not knowing something about what someone else in the roleplay will do.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>Back in my retail management days, we used to rely heavily on this type of situation. I'd write up some character cards (they couldn't share any info on the card) before the weekly training season, and then each employee would get their character.  Then it was the salesperson's job to sell them the item on the card.</p>
<p>A typical character card would be on a 3"x5" index card specially formatted and printed for our chain of stores and I'd fill it out like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a boy scout master stuck in the old ways and believe that the only good backpack is a metal frame pack.</li>
<li>You're here to buy a backpack for your son.  And you want it fitted in store.</li>
<li>Price range you will buy $xxx.xx to $xxx.xx</li>
<li>Important features for you are xxxx, xxxx, xxxx, and xxxx.</li>
<li>You can be convinced about internal frame packs if xxxx, xxxx, and xxxx happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first act of the night was always the hardest, but the employees usually got into the role-playing after the second or third go.  By the end of the night, people usually started playing their characters with gusto.  One of the cool things was that all the employees would watch the role plays and on good nights offer feedback after it was over.<br/>
When I left, I gave all my training material to the person who they promoted to replace me, so I don't have any of it now.  Now that I think of it, this was a huge opportunity missied for me at that job.  They awarded bonus money for ideas.  This could have been a big money maker.  My brother still works for them though...<br/>
On slow nights, I used to have employees just try to sell me something, and then I'd give them feedback, etc...  It was always a more fun way to pass the time instead of straightening and probably more productive than playing basketball, boccie, or throwing darts. Ah, sporting goods retail...</p>

                            You know, I remember a story about Naval War College simulation games, that were run by a training officer in order to educate cadets.  I think I heard the story from John Kim on RGFA in the mid 90's, so my details are really fuzzy.<br/>
<br/>
Here's my side question: does this style of game participate in a fourth creative agenda or not?  I'm tempted to say that's it's Sim, but it's not simulating anything imaginary, per se.                        </div>

<p>The three are just categories anyway; they're not atomic. I don't think there's a profitable reason to be looking for more labels.</p>

I'd agree with you, and go one further: they're not mutually exclusive.  <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I think there's been value demonstrated by saying: I want to play, run or write a game with _this_ agenda, and I'm wondering whether an Educational Agenda is analogous or not.                        </div>

                            Not to tangent further, but I find it useful to say, for instance, "I have a creative agenda to tell an engaging story about compelling characters."  Might that fall under the Narrativism umbrella?  Probably.  Is it more useful than saying "I want to play with narrativist agenda?" Almost certainly.<br/>

                            If the agenda of the game is even creative. <br/><br/>Because GNS was not designed to type every game ever played, just a certain subset thereof. And some of these games slide right out of that category and into another. <br/><br/>Though I find the whole arguement of "you play games not modes" to be getting a bit twee. It's certainly true, and I fully support the idea of "be a person not a label" --  but I also think we're approaching the degree of linguistic prudishness that would have us telling people off in modes such as "You did not visit America, you visited Chicago, which is only one city inside America. Please stop refering to your trip as "to the States" when it was to a single city."                        </div>

                            I'm with Brand -- the Big Model is right now totally geared towards the idea of recreational play.  Therapeutic or educational play is off somewhere else in space.<br/>

P.S.  This is not to say that recreational play can't be therapeutic or educational.  This is simply saying that that's not the central focus.                        </div>

                            Well, sort of.  I'd say that the Big Model's categories aren't very useful here, but I wouldn't say that educational play does not fall under G, N, or S.  It's just that it's like saying that this orange is a sphere -- true, just not useful information.                        </div>

<p>Not sure I agree.  To the extent that the following holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNS is describing what the reward system of the game revolves around  </li>
<li>Players will learn to, themselves, undertake actions that pursue that reward system  </li>
<li>Learning will occur based on what patterns of behavior players learn to undertake</li>
</ul>
<p>... it seems to me that GNS is telling you what sort of behavior you're trying to train.</p>
<p>A game that trains Esperanto <strong>has</strong> to be Sim ... it is a celebration of source material (in this case linguistic).  Players are rewarded for mastering the source material.</p>
<p>A game that trains people to make any category of moral judgment <strong>has</strong> to be Nar ... the question of how they address the thematic weight through their individual choices is paramount.  Players are rewarded for addressing those issues.</p>
<p>It's late, at the end of a long week though, so maybe this is just the Devil's Advocate section of my brain acting up.  Come morning I may disavow all of this :-)</p>

Having done therapeutic role-play, I can say it feels nothing like Narrativist play at all.  For one thing, it's a lot less fun.<br/>

<p>Okay.  I have no clue, whatsoever, what therapeutic role-play entails, or how it's connected to what I was saying.  Can you clarify?</p>

                            If we're saying that an educational game doesn't fall within the scope of a creative agenda, then by extension, doesn't it fall outside of the scope of the Big Model?  Which begs the question: "Doesn't that make the Big Model not so big?"<br/>
<br/>
Which, to be honest, strikes me as tautalogical.  But, I don't think that concepts like creative agendas, and how they interact with various design elements are inapplicable to a "serious game."  <br/>
<br/>
And, I'd argue that a teaching game would not be sim.  In sim, players reward one another for evoking or emulating the focus, not for mastering it.  A player with no good knowledge of the setting could successfully evoke it, and learn to consistantly evoke a setting he has no objective knowledge about.  Contrarywise, players with book-perfect knowledge of a setting will not necessarily successfully evoke it.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I'd argue that educationalism exists as a separate agenda -- one where we praise mastery of the subject -- and is probably served best by different design elements.  <br/>
<br/>
I think JBR's "LLLL":http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=622 serves as an excellent example of this phenomenon.  Of particular note: the hypothetical players encourage each other when they correctly guess the meaning of a word, and chide one another for their mistakes.  Second, resolution is completely couched in correct use of the language, which give me the impression of driving learning (and given the number of "I'd play that" responses, I don't think I'm alone.)                        </div>

                            Judson, first off, the Big Model isn't very big, true.  Or rather, it's not exhaustive.  However, I don't see why previously-identified Creative Agenda cannot be used in a complementary fashion with an "educational agenda."  I've run sims in my own classrooms, and let me tell you, the competitive impulse between tables has goaded students to try harder and learn more.                        </div>
