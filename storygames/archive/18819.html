It's full of 6 new class playbooks (now 7), tons of death moves, monsters, fronts, compendium classes, cursed magic item &amp; toolkit, locations &amp; toolkit, full color character illustrations, and more!<br/><br/><b>We just hit our 20k stretch goal and will be adding a new 7th class, Skirmisher! And all text will be released under CC BY 3.0 license early next year!</b><br/><br/><br/><b>Check out a free preview of the classes</b> (Backing at any reward level gets you instant access to 6 class playbooks! Check the Updates tab for the download.):<br/><br/><a href="http://flic.kr/s/aHsjHBnHNv" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World Playbooks</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/100574152@N08/sets/72157635149609946/" rel="nofollow">Fate Core Playbooks</a><br/><br/>We are making an awesome limited edition hardcover, large format, with full color art if you want something non-digital too!  Here are some art illustrations and mock ups of some pages from the book:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/yZ7JgfQ.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/OfZJspO.jpg"/><br/><br/>The physical edition will be a <b>HARDCOVER</b>, full <b>COLOR</b>, 8.5"x11" book with an estimated page count of<b> 150+ pages</b>. This is a limited edition run and every single book will be personalized by the creators (that's us!). Personalization means we'll sign it, doodle on it, write custom moves, draw mustaches on all the art, or otherwise deface it as much or as little as you want.<br/><br/>All backers that pledge at <b>$15 or more</b>, get the digital version of the book. This includes all of the content in the physical book, but in digital formats. You'll also get the revised playbooks improved from all the playtesting feedback we received (version 2 will go out soon). We'll also be doing a bunch of separate PDFs to make important content easy to reference and print. So here's the breakdown of what we have locked down so far. Any time you see a plus "+", that means there's a chance there will be more because of stretch goals or additional community contributions:<br/><br/> <b>7+</b> Dungeon World class playbooks<br/> <b>6+</b> Fate Core classes, with theme descriptions, aspects, and stunts<br/> <b>15+</b> Playable Species with custom moves, free aspect invokes, and portrait illustrations<br/>     Grim World <b>setting tips and GM philosophies</b><br/> <b>The Hunt</b> faction details about their structure, hidden caches, lodges, hunting trophies and contracts<br/> <b>8+</b> DW style Compendium Classes to flesh out your characters<br/> <b>7+</b> GM Fronts/Arcs for building a campaign<br/>     Grim World <b>locations </b>and the Grim World <b>Location Builder</b> (roll some dice for an instant adventure location)<br/> <b>20+</b> Monsters with descriptions, instincts, weaknesses, and portrait illustrations<br/>     Loads of gear including new magic items, cursed items, and a Cursed Item Toolkit (to build your own cursed magic items)<br/> <b>36+</b> (yes, 36 and counting!) additional Death Moves, including all standard DW classes, Inverse World classes, and tons of other custom classes (written by Jacob Randolph and other awesome contributors from the community)<br/> <b>ART!!! </b>Full page class illustrations, spot illustrations (for species, monsters, magic items), and additional icons and sketches, all to make Grim World come alive!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421671/#Comment_421671" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T11:06:57+00:00" title="September 19, 2013 11:06AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a late backers link on the Kickstarter page for indecisive people like me.  Honestly, mostly getting it for the character classes, some of them seem very evocative. A good playable necromancer is very hard to find!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
