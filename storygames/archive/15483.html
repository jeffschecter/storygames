It's a coming of age story at it's heart, where the protagonist tries to chart his path into the future. The issue is that there is very little conflict in the story. There are important decisions to be made, but no real conflicts per-say. I know that our medium excels at examining conflicts and without that framework, I can't find anything to latch onto.  <br/><br/>How would you design a conflict-free roleplaying game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351133/#Comment_351133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T21:39:58+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  9:39PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>For a start, I'd look at <em>Do</em>, though Daniel says it's not a role-playing game.

People don't need to all want the same thing, but if they want variations, they can start to find compromises and build things up from there.  I think that conflict turns up as an 'activity' in roleplaying games because it's easy to define to the players, but that exploration/experiential/relationship type plot lines can be just as gripping, if not more.  Get people involved in world building - I've run some games where the central premise wasn't conflict, it was building up a shared fiction, and I think they worked well.  And avoid the temptation to give people points or tokens or awards for 'good' roleplaying - I think that encourages people to start keeping score, which rouses their competitive instincts again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351140/#Comment_351140" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T23:21:03+00:00" title="December 10, 2011 11:21PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Witch Quest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IvanHo" title="IvanHo"><img alt="IvanHo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IvanHo">IvanHo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351152/#Comment_351152" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-11T04:54:39+00:00" title="December 11, 2011  4:54AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not at all what you're looking for, but everyone should know (not necessarily play) <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/ladyotto/" rel="nofollow">Lady &amp; Otto</a>.

Most of the problems being solved involve some sort of conflict, and the troubles the Pilgrims get into are also conflicts. Though maybe you mean that the mechanics aren't conflict oriented, in the sense that in theory you could substitute 'getting into trouble' and 'helping somebody' with other things, and then you're correct.<br/><br/>I also think that games which are heavy on experiencing something can work without conflict. When the idea of the game is less to actually GAME something, but to get into somebody's shoes, to immerse into a certain situation. Nordic LARPs come to mind, or table-top games which try to achieve the same goals. Lady and Otto is sort of an example of that, but not really (because that, like many Jeepforms, is more of an experiment on people than a game).<br/>I also once played a game which was essentially one big philosophical discussion in a thin veneer of role-playing - which is fun if you like that sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351165/#Comment_351165" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-11T08:50:02+00:00" title="December 11, 2011  8:50AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I do, in fact, mean that the mechanics aren't conflict oriented.

I feel very strongly that this is a crutch in game design that we would benefit from having alternatives to.  "Conflict resolution" is often viewed as the core of game design when it's really just one aspect of what's happening.  So, yes, you can definitely design games without formal conflict resolution.  It's super easy, in fact!  It just isn't done all that often yet.  This will probably change over the next 10 years or so.<br/><br/>If you're talking about mimicking stories that don't really have any narrative tension at all (like, um, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodnight_Moon" rel="nofollow">Goodnight Moon</a>, for example), that's something else, but it's related, I think.  It's definitely possible to structure interesting narrative content in a game-like fashion without relying on inter-player conflict, fictional conflict, or even narrative tension or mechanical tension to drive play.  There aren't a lot of games that do this yet, but I expect we'll see more of these too, over time.<br/><br/>Since Max mentioned my game <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2011/11/05/metrofinal-beta-released/" rel="nofollow">Metrofinal</a>, I consider it an early, rudimentary effort to push in these directions.

These games are fairly traditional in their basic rules structure, but basically on every level they are geared towards nonviolent resolution of relatively simple, ordinary problems. These games don't lack any conflict of any kind, but they do avoid grand and desperate conflicts in favor of things like helping friends reconcile and clearing up misunderstandings.<br/><br/>For a while now I've been wanting to make a game based on slice of life manga like Azumanga Daioh, which would need to be more about characters interacting and reacting to situations and scenery than any kind of conflict per se, and I'm still trying to work out how exactly to go about making such a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_351220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351220/#Comment_351220" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-11T23:41:20+00:00" title="December 11, 2011 11:41PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2011 11:50PM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that regarding games as a form of childrens play for grown ups, makes it easier to design in the field of conflict-free drama. Games are by tradition perceived as competitive, and that makes <i>conflicts</i> the beating heart of most games. So designing for "playing around" with no conflicts is easier without the "game"-idea lurking around. In my view it is still a game, but in a more modern and un-traditional sense.<br/><br/><i>The Sims</i> is a game that comes to mind, letting people play around in a kind of ordinary alternate reality.<br/><br/><i>MineCraft</i> is popular with my sons, and there is little conflict in romping about building things in that game. There are some monsters, but my impression is that those monsters soon became uninteresting/irrelevant. building beautiful, big and/or complex structures seems to be the big thing in the game. A bit like lego, in my view.<br/><br/>Both these games being vastly popular makes me think that similar directions of design in role-playing games, is a challenge with the potential of great games laying in wait.<br/><br/>It's still a tall order, of course. Finding a theme that draws enough interest to be worthy of play, and unlocking the potential of such a theme, is a great challenge. Designing such a game demands as much skill and intelligence as any other game-design, and a will to choose the road less travelled in present design-culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351225/#Comment_351225" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T05:25:15+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  5:25AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I notice a conspicuous absence of Mcdaldno's <i>Ribbon Drive</i> from this thread, which is nonsensical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351240/#Comment_351240" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T08:41:22+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  8:41AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>There are some monsters, but my impression is that those monsters soon became uninteresting/irrelevant. building beautiful, big and/or complex structures seems to be the big thing in the game.

I think the key may be hidden in the choices that Ish has to make himself in the books. They are all about his internal conflicts about where his life is going. Does he want to be a trader? Does he want trading to be all he is? Does he want a life companion? Does he want to help his friends succeed? Does he want to do the 'right' thing dispite the potential dangers? All of these questions and more are the conflicts that surround Ish throughout his journey. Much of the books are about building up relationships with the other characters and trying to help them through their own internal struggles. You see how Ish helps Sarah, Pip, and others whom he takes under his wing. It is by building these relationships and then forming groups out of these relationships that those around Ish are able to see his issues and help him deal with them. <br/><br/>Quick question for OP: are you looking to build a game that does the Traders Tales specificly or are you just looking to tell that kind of story regardless of setting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_351284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351284/#Comment_351284" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T12:50:10+00:00" title="December 12, 2011 12:50PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What's the challenges of a game?</b><br/>- it don't have to be a conflict, to be a challenge to the player/s<br/>- meeting a challenge is ... uh ... challenging<br/>- "challenge" may be something that provoke some kind of though or emotion in the player<br/>- exploring a strange world may be challenging<br/>- walking the shoes of a strange being may be challenging<br/>- floating about in a surreal scope may be challenging<br/>- petite interaction may be a great challenge<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>There's lots of phenomenons to be created by interaction, with enough of a challenge to engage a player group.

There is a genre of story originating in China and Japan centuries ago that contains no conflict. It's called <i>Kishotenketsu</i>.<br/><br/>A Kishotenketsu story consists of four phases:\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction, in which the setting and characters are brought to light (just like in a European three-act drama).</li>\n<li>Development, in which the initial situation is added to to develops into a new situation.</li>\n<li>Twist, in which a radical change in focus or sudden twist is starkly presented.</li>\n<li>Conclusion, in which the story wraps up by tying together the twist and preceding developments into a nice bow.</li>\n</ol>\nNotice that nowhere did I use the words "conflict", "climax", "stakes", or "problem". That's because those things are absent or even non-existent in a Kishotenketsu story. The emotional impact comes from exposition, contrast, and unification of elements rather than conflict and escalation.<br/><br/>This is especially interesting because this narrative structure pervades modern Japanese works. A "4-Koma" (four panel) manga uses this structure with each panel corresponding to a phase.

It's about employees at a tavern.<br/><br/>When people play it, they often want to know what happens when one player wants one thing and another player wants another thing. So far, our answers have been:<br/><br/>* Just talk it out.<br/>* Whoever holds the highest card wins. (In The Tavern, you're always holding a card, so this means you just go straight through the conflict without it becoming a thing.)<br/>* In a conflict, whoever doesn't back down gets fired.<br/><br/>I like the last rule best. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384580/#Comment_384580" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-08T18:25:35+00:00" title="July  8, 2012  6:25PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> * In a conflict, whoever doesn't back down gets fired. </blockquote>+1                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384584/#Comment_384584" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-08T19:06:30+00:00" title="July  8, 2012  7:06PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that last rule, but I would want to know one more thing: how long do you have to back down?

You give up on that thing you wanted (and, incidentally, welcome to the world of employment). It's like the opposite of Let It Ride: when you give up, the giving-up carries forward.<br/><br/>Well, maybe. We haven't sorted out the details yet.<br/><br/>But, to get away from our game and back to topic: I think, rather than considering non-conflicty games <i>in general</i>, we might consider them in fictional context. Ribbon Drive's mechanisms work in context; so do Polaris' mechanisms; so do those of Breaking The Ice. But I think you get those mechanisms by being faithful to the fictional context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384594/#Comment_384594" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-08T23:44:34+00:00" title="July  8, 2012 11:44PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the German example of conflict-less storytelling that parallels <i>kishotenketsu</i>, see the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Birch-Pfeiffer" rel="nofollow">Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer.</a><br/><br/>Her plays are adaptations of popular novels and historical figures' biographies that remove as much conflict from the narratives as possible.<br/><br/>Basically, how they work is:<br/>--antagonists are presented <i>first</i>, and as horribly misguided human beings<br/>--innocent protagonist sweeps in, all eloquent and hopelessly naive, and everybody recognizes his/her innate goodness<br/>--at the same time, this protagonist recognizes that he/she cannot immediately have what he/she wants, and so acquiesces to the power of the antagonists \u2013 usually this means getting locked in prison or put in an obviously unsuitable marriage, etc.<br/>--by acquiescing to the antagonists, the protagonists are <i>afforded infinite power over reality</i> \u2013 the antagonists suddenly see the error of their ways, illegitimate lovers go off to unceremoniously die in Padua, society does whatever it can to get the protagonist back on track<br/>--the ending is an inspiring little message to everybody, even though nobody really came to real blows or confrontations<br/><br/>Birch-Pfeiffer was the German equivalent of J.K.

Is internal longing, pain, conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384627/#Comment_384627" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T16:15:29+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  4:15PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Completely randomize the game so it lacks player intent.

So allow me a moment to clean my pretentious theorist glasses. *wipe*<br/><br/>Conflict is <b>a tension between two or more possible, defined outcomes.</b><br/><br/>In the typical protagonist-antagonist setup (and I do mean protagonist/antagonist, not hero/villain necessarily), we have two characters who's goals are at odds with each other. It's conflict because we know what they want but don't know who will get it.<br/><br/>Just a protagonist with a clear goal, and no real antagonist is also conflict, because he might not get what he wants. There's your two possible, defined outcomes, right there.<br/><br/>All the examples I've given concern themselves with goals, but that's still not the only kind of conflict. Like, if you have a story where the Earth might be hit be a meteor, and the protagonist isn't doing anything to stop it, that's still conflict.<br/><br/>The kishotenketsu structure doesn't have conflict built in because the impact comes unifying two previously discordant elements. The satisfying wrap-up doesn't come from knowing which of multiple outcomes wins out, it's from figuring out how the story all fits together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384677/#Comment_384677" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T06:33:00+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  6:33AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So maybe "A Taste For Murder" has both types?

The elements are "finding each other," so to speak.
