We get into a three way conflict between PC's. Both Player A and C are opposed to Player B. Dice hit the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Player's A roll stands and Player B has to answer to it. Player B rolls, does not exceed Player A's roll, but does roll better than half. Player B is still in, Player A takes the advantage die.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer B does not get to make a move since they already answered Player A's move.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer C, rolling the smallest and fewest dice, opts not to make a move at all. The reasoning being (and this was vocalized at the time) that the result of making a move now would probably allow Player B to take an advantage die.<br/>\n<br/>\nRound two begins, all three players roll their dice, conflict continues.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question: is Player C's pass legal, or does he have to make a move?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gut reaction is that since he is already in the conflict he either has to make move or negotiate out, and is no longer participating in the conflict. I don't recall this issue being mentioned in the text, but I don't have the text on hand to check it out (we are rotating GM's and the book rotates with them).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368265/#Comment_368265" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T14:04:23+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  2:04PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have the game at hand, but I think that by the rules, player C should have made a move.

Only those that are tying to oppose others should roll, even if round to round. <br/><br/>Lumpley's forums probably have a more definitive answer...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368273/#Comment_368273" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T15:36:15+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  3:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if C chooses not to do something, then C really wasn't as involved in the conflict as they thought at first?
