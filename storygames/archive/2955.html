My pitch for the evening was:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">...post-cyberpunk investigative journalism. (So Call of Cthulu, with the investigators led by Spider Jerusalem,<br/>\nbut cowritten with William Gibson, and The Man instead of Elder Gods.)</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nNext time, I might bring in more firm guidelines about difficulties, and I might have a lower cap on Pool sizes. I also found that it's hard to find a place for the trading of narration to matter greatly (not just in the Pool, but in several other games as well). But it worked quite well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67025/#Comment_67025" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T16:26:24+00:00" title="May  6, 2007  4:26PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to add: a part of why it was so enjoyable is that everyone caught onto the vibe. The journalists leveraged their army of acolytes on GoogleTube and the InterBlag to fight the forces of Corporate Power. The players were very adept at cutting through the BS and finding Truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was interesting to see how the internet can affect games with a large investigation component. (Especially in our case, where the internet was effectively omnipresent.) It can be tricky to still have an interesting investigative game if the truth can be gotten through such means; a lot of "skip the dice, just say yes" was helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
