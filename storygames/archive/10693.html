All the parts are there but the soup isn\u2019t alive yet. It needs a good jolt of electricity \u2013 the questions is how much and what kind.<br/><br/>Synopsis: This is a tile placement board game in which players lay out a maze of locations with encounter tiles beneath them. They then move characters into the maze, meet the encounters, and find out what the mystery is. Then they deal with the fall out as the mystery explodes.<br/><br/>I can envision that at the start of the game the players pick characters and that one player plays \u201cThe Bad Guy\u201d. The players collectively decide what mission the party is on. There will be a set list of possible missions, all very generic. The bad guy then lays out the maze and places the encounters. The players know there is a hidden twist in the maze that they will uncover. They do this by making up clues based on the encounters they have. The game has a set list of twists (that define the end game rules). The clues point to what the twist is but as soon as a player makes an action that says \u201cThis is it.\u201d The twist explodes and the players start the end game. Players get to make up things in the maze based on the actions their character makes. So they make up what they find in a room and another player decides what they have to roll for that to happen. Each player also gets ten to twenty \u201cunexpected event\u201d tokens to make things up things out of sequence or in places where their character isn\u2019t at. The bad guy gets more of these because they aren\u2019t running a regular character. <br/><br/>So the players move around a maze, have encounters, and solve a mystery, all very D+D. <br/><br/>The game play would be as follows:<br/><br/>1.  Players move their characters into the maze (there are movement rules that slow you down depending on how much you are carrying). <br/><br/>2. Movement stops when you enter an unexplored area or an area with an encounter in it. <br/><br/>3. Players may interact with rooms and encounters by making up an \u201cAction\u201d describing what their character does in that area and what the outcome is. <br/><br/>4. Another player acts as the referee and decides what the player has to roll for their action to happen. <br/><br/>5. Each character gets to make one free action each turn. <br/><br/>6. Unexpected event tokens can be spent to buy the right to make counter-arguments to actions and to make events happen in other parts of the maze. <br/><br/>7. Player will find (read that \u201cMake Up\u201d) clue that identify the mystery. <br/><br/>8. They also will fish for advantages to help them when the twist explodes. <br/><br/>9. Combat is handled by counter-arguments. <br/><br/>10. Once the twist is revealed the players rush to accomplish whatever end game task is called for. (Saving the world and the like.)<br/><br/>All this is very solid and on the surface it looks like it should work and be a fun game \u2013 but for some reason when I run it through thought experiments it doesn\u2019t spring to life. It feels flat.<br/><br/>If players have to make up everything in the maze then the game is demanding a hell of a lot of energy from them. If they aren\u2019t up for that level of creative freedom then they won\u2019t want to play \u2013 quite honestly I\u2019m not up for that level of creative work on a regular basis. <br/><br/>I think the game needs a little more structure to give it a \u201cstory now\u201d feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237186/#Comment_237186" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T11:15:22+00:00" title="October 13, 2009 11:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why do I think the game is lacking?<br/><br/>What I have made is effectively D+D. But unlike D+D it is not crunchy. In a D+D game I know I\u2019m going to go in a dungeon and have encounters. I know I\u2019m then going to play a tactical wargame and do some puzzle solving. This is enough to take up several hours of play. I\u2019m not making up the dungeon \u2013 that has already been done for me. I\u2019m just taking in the experience.<br/><br/>In my game they players enter the maze and find encounters but then they describe Matrix Actions to say what happens. There is no GM (the bad guy player is just another player) that roll is shared between the players when they referee one another\u2019s actions (which means setting the to happen roll). The players go into a room and tell the GM/Referee that they pick what they find there. One roll later and the action happens or doesn\u2019t. BAM! Super fast and totally crunch free.<br/><br/>Combat isn\u2019t much more complex. Everyone in the area a fight takes place is describes how they think the fight plays out. Each has a referee set the to happen roll and then they do a dice-rolling contest to see which one happens. BAM! Fast and essentially no crunch.<br/><br/>The pit fall of this is that the crunch is a big part of the fun of playing a D+D game. By taking it away the game leaves a lot of empty space that needs to be filled with something fun. <br/><br/>I believe that the rules need to give this fun rather than wait for the players to invent themselves into a fun game. If they have to twist that far to make a game work then I\u2019ve not done my job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237187/#Comment_237187" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T11:15:46+00:00" title="October 13, 2009 11:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay \u2013 so system matters. The total freedom of Matrix Actions is not enough because it leaves the players with too much control and not enough guidance. This gets me thinking about other games and how they create \u201cStory Now\u201d.<br/><br/>My understanding of Sorcerer is that the players are given the opening premise \u201cHow far will you go to get what you want?\u201d The game gives them a situation where there is something they want. The GM has a relationship map that shows how everyone in that story are connected. When the players use power to get what they want they pull strings in the relationship map and dominos start to fall. When they use more power to deal with the fall out more strings are pulled and eventually the whole house of cards falls. <br/><br/>The relationship map is the rules mechanism that allows the GM to jive with the players improvise the flood of shit that follows using magic. Each step is a potential nightmare that really grips the player\u2019s imaginations as they try to go further to get their way. <br/><br/>The other system tool that drives the here now drama that comes to mind is the fortune in the middle conflict resolution mechanic of Dogs in the Vineyard where the dice rolling encourages players to escalate violence. \u201cHow far will you go to enforce God\u2019s Law?\u201d Will you shoot the pregnant woman? She is channeling the devil, she\u2019s the cause of everyone\u2019s problems. She\u2019s escalating the fight with you. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to pull your gun? I can just see the tension in the players as their own sense of right and wrong are challenged. <br/><br/>Both of these games sound so much more dynamic than: \u201cWe enter a room and I want the monster to die in a brief fight. We then find a magic map on him.\u201d Yawn!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237188/#Comment_237188" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T11:16:10+00:00" title="October 13, 2009 11:16AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve got the beginnings of an idea on how to bring the drama into the room but it\u2019s vague.<br/><br/>I know I like games where the players are interacting with one another in a friendly banter (some competition but not dominated by it) way. I know I want the characters interacting as well and for them to have conflicting agendas. At first I thought to get this going by assigning victory points to behaviors I wanted to encourage. I\u2019ll certainly do some of that but that is not emotionally interesting really. <br/><br/>The vague idea is for each character to have a \u201ccognitive pyramid\u201d which is to say a simple picture of their thoughts and motivations that would show why they were the way they were. A triangle has three sides so the pyramid would have three elements. The would be 1. Connection, 2. Crisis, and 3. Player\u2019s Choice.<br/><br/>Connection would be some goal the character has to connect to other people. It tells the player what they want to get from the other characters (as they solve the mystery).<br/><br/>Crisis would be an existential crisis about how the person viewed themselves and their place in the world.<br/><br/>Personal Choice would be something the players made up on their own \u2013 to personalize the character. <br/><br/>For Example:<br/><br/>Connection: You want to ask her out but you can never get up the nerve\u2026 Whimp!<br/>Crisis: I hate myself. If you just knew me you\u2019d hate me to.<br/>Choice: I love Star Wars.<br/><br/>The player would know that they would need to try and ask someone out but then sabotage themselves because who would want to date them anyway. Or maybe they would act to try and overcome their self hate. Maybe they would sacrifice themselves to save the others to show his true love\u2026 The players could do a lot with this.<br/><br/>As Matrix Actions are made they can alter a character\u2019s cognitive pyramid so the players can see how the character changes. This would allow the game to function like a movie where the characters are supposed to change due to what happens. You could see the mental changes.<br/><br/>My wife things this will not work. I\u2019m not certain it will but if it does I could see it forcing players to address the premise \u201cHow do you deal with your shit while trying to save the world?\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237189/#Comment_237189" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T11:16:40+00:00" title="October 13, 2009 11:16AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay so there is my thinking.

An older version of the game had players make "Arguments" for what they wanted to happen that included an Action a Result and Three Reasons. That version of the game did use an independent referee to judge all arguments. The player then rolled for success or failure.<br/><br/>In more recent years I've made it simpler so it would be easier for new players. Now players describe an "Action" but don't need to provide reasons. Often the action is presented as a narrative of a scene. The player then pick any of the other players to be their referee that turn. This means the referee job can fall on any player so the task and power is shared amoungst the players.<br/><br/>It's a simple elegant game engine which unfortunately in this instance just doesn't have enough drama.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237214/#Comment_237214" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T13:12:52+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  1:12PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, this may seem flip, but it's not meant that way.<br/><br/>Read all of the articles here: <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html</a><br/><br/>Then read as many of these as you can: <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/toc.php?by=cats" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/toc.php?by=cats </a><br/><br/>That's the comprehensive course on how to think about Story Now play and design.

The players know they are going to venture into the Cave of Wonders...<br/><br/>The story goes that no one returns from the cave the same way they entered. Some come out better for the experience others worse. All they know for certain is that bad things happen there but that there is plenty of gold.<br/><br/>Say they have to choose between the following mission: 1. Loot the cave!!! 2. Rescue the princess. 3. Retrieve the magic ring for Jafar. The players know that there are three possible twists in the dungeon: 1. Goblins! (All the Goblins on the board attack and more come in each turn. Time to run.) 2. Zombie Jamborie, (Everything you've killed comes back to life. Fight your way out!) and 3. Cave in! (The ground starts rumbling. Locations start collapsing! Get out while you still can.)<br/><br/>The bad guy player lays out the location tiles face down (building the maze). He then puts encounters on the locations. In this case the bad guy puts down the princess encounter, a necromancer, and the Book of the Dead. Clearly the bad guy wants a Zombie Jamborie - but it is up to the clues the players make up to determin if this twist will happen. <br/><br/>I was thinking the game would come with Pregenerated archtypal characters with contact and crisis already writen, leaving the player to supply choice. Teh characters would likely be...<br/><br/>The Elf: Contact: I want to get everyone to say they like me. Crisis: Noone really likes me. They just want my body. Shallow bastards!<br/>The Dwarf: Contact: Prove that you are better than everyone else so they will like you. Crisis: I know they are talking about me behind my back!<br/>The Ranger: Contact: Try to keep everyone happy. Crisis: If I can't keep them happy then I've failed at everything! I'm such a failure! I hope no one notices.<br/><br/>They go into the dungeon and do the typical dungeon things. We all know how that works but because Matrix Actions make it so fast and easy to do it is not enough meat to make the game fun. It's too easy! <br/><br/>What I was thinking about was movies and how they work. Take the first Alien movie. In a game the Alien should just run straight at them and kill them. It would take a few minutes at most. But he doesn't do that. The bad guy hides an picks them off one by one. The crew of the Nostromo bicker amoungst themselves and we enjoy watching it. If more had survived we'd have seen more personal growth but as it is Only Ripley gets a chance to grow emotionally. Maybe not by much, it is sci fi after all. When I thought about this movie I thought "Gee, the alien has a fear of confronting more than one person at a time - social phobia? And boy is he over compensating for something having to rip people appart like that." Giving players internal motivations for their characters explains why people adopt sub-optimal strategies. It's not just a plot devise - it's a motivation (As in the actor in the rubber suit asking the director "What's my motivation?)<br/><br/>Lastly about the referee - I'm having players share the referee role in all my fast to face games. I still use a single central referee in PBEMs but that's all. Sharing the task means no one is the game master, which I kind of like.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237224/#Comment_237224" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T13:50:45+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  1:50PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm.

Like, the challenges are symbolic in some way, even though they manifest as physical challenges.<br/><br/>So, hrm. How much info do the players know about one another's characters? Is it all open?<br/><br/>What if the three character points of background were all open to all players and seperated out by space beneath each one? The open space could be used to expand on/alter whatever the nature quality was as the game was played. Maybe it fills in some backstory? Or changes how the character feels about the backstory, as play progresses?<br/><br/>What if it changed as the players encounter squares of challenge, then the manner in which it changes is limited by whether they succeed or fail in the challenge? And who would decide each?<br/><br/>You know, it weirdly sounds like a Rite of Passage situation to me. Or, perhaps Death. Which I suppose is a type of RoP.<br/><br/>Also, the more I think about it, the more I think that you could have a whole bunch of open information in this game, since the fun is in the color elements that the players throw at each other to deal with and how they work up the backstory as play progresses.<br/><br/>As for play time and creative burnout, I suggest checking out the thread on play session length. It seems like lots of folks are playing relatively short sessions commonly these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237227/#Comment_237227" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T13:56:32+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  1:56PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think it should be open - and with preset characters it would have to be.

An older version of the game had players make "Arguments" for what they wanted to happen that included an Action a Result and Three Reasons. That version of the game did use an independent referee to judge all arguments. The player then rolled for success or failure.<br/><br/>In more recent years I've made it simpler so it would be easier for new players. Now players describe an "Action" but don't need to provide reasons. Often the action is presented as a narrative of a scene. The player then pick any of the other players to be their referee that turn. This means the referee job can fall on any player so the task and power is shared amoungst the players.<br/><br/>It's a simple elegant game engine which unfortunately in this instance just doesn't have enough drama.</blockquote>\nHere's my take, based ONLY on what you've described here and reading through your website some time ago (hence the "make three arguments" thing). The Matrix method, basically, results in a series of very reasonable, very plausible outcomes. This is terrific for simulation (and not just the physics kind): it's reasonable that a trained cop could outrun a junkie; it's reasonable that a wealthy politician might have access to hired muscle.<br/><br/>The deal with rolling dice, though -- of adding any kind of random factor -- is that you're opening the door to UNreasonable, IMplausible outcomes. Surprises. The tension you feel surrounding the rolling of dice, the drawing of cards, whatever is that the result will surprise you. This, to me, is pretty key to exciting RPGish stories.<br/><br/>That said, I think there's room for stories of inevitability. Where the situation that kicks everything off is such that it cannot end any way other than how it ended. There are no sudden twists. There are no big reveals. I don't know that that kind of narrative has really been explored in RPGs, since we've placed high value of excitement. I guess it's the difference between The Ice Harvest and No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>So based on the parameters -- as I understand them -- of your Matrix process, it probably comes down to setting up that initial situation. I totally don't see any sense of inevitability in a classic dungeon delve. That, to me, is the very definition of surprises and twists and unexpected outcomes. But maybe it doesn't have to be! Entering a dungeon with some inevitable outcome that everyone's marching toward feels a little bit like...I don't know, maybe The Descent (although in that movie, the underground cannibal-monster-people are a BIG surprise ... even though you just KNOW everyone going into that cave is going to meet a gruesome ending).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237250/#Comment_237250" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T15:01:03+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  3:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2009 3:01PM by komradebob.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><br/>Here's my take, based ONLY on what you've described here and reading through your website some time ago (hence the "make three arguments" thing).

There must be many ways there. Story inevitability is one. <br/><br/>The Premise "How far will you go to get what you want?" suggests and esculation ofhow far that is like rushing up to a cliff. You know if you keep going you'll fall. It's just a matter of when. The premise "How far will you go to enforce God's Law?" does the same thing because when you start down the road of violence eventually you are worse than the sinners you are punishing. A relationship map mechanic supports this kind of play because it helps the GM decide what consequences follow action.<br/><br/>The idea of a cognitive pyramid is a kind of relationship map that shows a character's mental state. I figure all the characters need to be pretty neurotic to be fun. As the players play I hope that they will act out the insanity in the character's pyramid. It would be a kind of psychodrama. You could experiment with different ways to act and see how other people react. As a simulation it would be fun. I think it could lead to the premise "How do you deal with your shit while trying to save the world/carry out a mission?"<br/><br/>One of my weaknesses as a designer is a tendency to create a static state. My office at work is very still and peaceful becaues of that (which is useful since I am a psychotherapist). The trouble with this is games is that static is boring. In my other story games I've fought against this trait by starting games on the edge of a cliff and the opening move pushes them over (Cthulhu horror - the zombies are coming, Sherlock Holmes a murder has just happened. Nazi spies your spy gets off the train in London) there is a plot track that suggests what should happen but it is totally up to the players to make it happen. They routinely do and these games are fun and well tested (over 20 years now) but I still feel a nagging sensation that I'm missing the emotional mark. <br/><br/>I'd like the games to be more than just problem solving.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237378/#Comment_237378" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T08:22:29+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  8:22AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I can totally see your tendency toward a static state in the way the Matrix procedure works. It reads like it would produce a constant de-escalation, reasonable outcome building upon reasonable outcome, inevitably marching toward even more reasonable outcomes.<br/><br/>I wonder if you could bake into your procedure a requirement for escalation? The idea here would be to force the players to stretch harder and harder to achieve these escalating outcomes by offering less-and-less-reasonable arguments in their favor.<br/><br/>At some point, your impartial ref -- or your opponent, if you roll that way -- will have to stop judging based on reasonableness and start judging based on excitement value.<br/><br/>I wonder if there's some switch, some formal procedure, by which the ref moves from "what is reasonable" to "what is the most exciting thing being proposed?" I have no idea what impact on play that would have. It might get silly, since exciting is sort of the polar opposite of reasonable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237395/#Comment_237395" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T09:17:40+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  9:17AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't suppose you could just do something simple like put escalation into the rules/play suggestions?<br/><br/>Also, and I don't mean to harp on this point too much, but right now failure results don't result in anything directly, they just nullify the attempted direction.<br/><br/>Is it possible for you to put some sort of escalation track in for failures? Not just for an individual's failures, but for everyone's failures, that causes or suggests things get more out of hand?<br/><br/>Another suggestion I had was that it might be worth opening up failure results to some input from the other players. Right now, it's pretty much just up to the ref to determine argument strength, and then the player rolls and succeeds or fails. What happens if, when they fail, the other players are freely allowed to pick failure results/complications? Or perhaps all players pick failure results and there's a random roll to determine which takes effect?<br/><br/>I'm not sure I have any good suggestions for emotionally deep pplay, though.

Here is a summary of my summary.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Starting and stopping scenes is an easy issue in Matrix Games. <br/><br/>Negotiating what happens is also very easily managed in MGs because of the action counter-argument mechanic.<br/><br/>In terms of GNS I believe that MGs could support any agenda, just as with a lot of rules. <br/><br/>In terms of conflict resolution versus task resolution I\u2019ve never been certain where MGs lie. Actions and counter-arguments look a lot like conflict resolution because it is about saying what the final outcome is rather than doing a lot of little rolls and in the end turning to the GM for them to confirm what happened. But it is not a mechanic that overtly supports narrative play.<br/><br/>Suspense: I do not think MGs have a delaying the inevitable element so by Vincent\u2019s definition they are not suspensefully. I have to agree there. They are good problem solving and exploration games but they aren\u2019t suspenseful. In fact everyone is cooperating to get to the stories end as quick as possible.<br/><br/>Character Death: Characters can be killed at any time and it doesn\u2019t matter because the player is not out of the game. Players usually do kill characters to set up stakes, escalate, and make statements but that is them imposing it. It\u2019s not driven by the rules. That is a real weakness. I want the rules to drive interesting play.<br/><br/>As far as practical conflict resolution I need to include this. I really think I need to revisit there being no consequence for failing action rolls. I\u2019m thinking maybe it should be a psychological effect on their character\u2019s cognitive pyramid.<br/><br/>Arranging pieces: I think MGs do not force players to escalate conflicts. When it happens (and it does happen) it is because the players are driving it.<br/>I think Matrix Actions do make play happen right there in the room but again it is the players driving it. The resolution rules make it easy but don\u2019t force it.<br/><br/>Burning down the Firewall: This is one thing MGs do very well at. Every player can have a hand in every scene by making counter-arguments. Players are definitely not as tied to their characters as in other games.<br/><br/>Resolution why? This is the point that made my skin crawl. \u201cThe only worthwhile use for rules I know of is to sustain in-game conflict of interest, in the face of the overwhelming unity of interest of the players.\u201d Wrote Vincent. My static design tendency is towards playing nice and not getting in people\u2019s faces. I\u2019ve even been so nice as to not have consequences to failed action rolls. It is like a wheel chair.

I don't recall ever having seen one. Mostly I've seen, well action, sci-fi, war, and similar stuff. Do you think it would be different with a different kind of set up for a game?<br/><br/>I mean, less <i>Duffer's Drift </i>or Dungeon crawl, more <i>Bless the Beasts and Children/To Kill a Mockingbird/Ordinary People </i>?<br/><br/>For that sort of thing, what i've noticed is that the conflicts are human level <b>and</b> the characters themselves, internally, have incompatible wants in addition to the incompatible wants between characters.<br/><br/>Given your profession, I'm pretty sure you have a backlog of things you've seen you could use for that. Whether you really want to do that...<br/><br/>I'd also point to something I associate with Ron Edward's thinking: If you want some really serious drama, base it around those incompatible wants that put pressures on ties of blood (family) and sex. That stuff is inevitably personal, and players will drill down on that, bringing in their own personal life experiences, even if in a negative or exaggerated way.<br/><br/>Sometimes things can stand in for those kinds of ties, but, honestly they're always a bit toned down bycomparison. A mentor-student relationship really rarely can truly substitute for a parent-child relationship, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237635/#Comment_237635" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T05:10:30+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  5:10AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They can be "face stabby" wargames espeically (you are trying to kill one another after all).

The player are all one voice in Bob's brain. I pose a problem that Bob faces and they come up with competing arguments for how Bob handles it. I judge them (which gives them feedback on how likely I think it is to happen) and a dice rolling contest settles what happens. Then they switch into the roles of people areound Bob. They make an action to react to Bob's move. Invariably people come up with every codependent reaction known to man. If their action roll fails they get a default consequence - "You feel bad." <br/><br/>Bob's Brain uses stakes but they are emotional and default. Having internal fall out doesn't mess up any game balance aspects but still gives a cost. <br/><br/>I can see combining a player's action with an emotional consequence given to them by another player. This would put the players in a collaboartive role in regards to telling a characters story. None of us are totally incontrol of our character just as think we are also not in control of our own lives/thoughts/emotions. It would also mean something happens every turn no matter what.

The premise is "How con you hold it together while trying to save the world?" The characters are all somewhat messed up. Each one has a mental matrix that includes a "Conflict" which is about and interpersonal issue and a "Crisis" which is a self esteme/self loathing issue. As the game is played the characters will gain more issues which will eventually cause them to have a nervous breakdown. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis give the players the suspense of the inevitable "You are going to go crazy if you keep doing this long enough" outcome that they will work to delay. It will give the game stakes because each action they do in the game will have a built in consequence of failure - namely that they pick another character to make up a new element for their mental matrix. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe player will be collaborating in destorying one another's characters and the destruction can be as fun as succeeding with the big picture mission that the characters are on. As the character's get more and more messed up I need to have that escalate the conflict. Maybe I'll make it negative dice modifier to to happen rolls? I'm not clear how to escalate this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will put in a rule that only the player can make their character die. Others can only capture or wound people. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mission, maze, and twist will work as I first described so in effect there are two games going on. The tactical game and the mental game. No mater what is rolled action happens and both can be fun. I can also assign victory points to actions so it can have a gamist winner. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've breezed over the tactical game - citing a D+D like dungeon crawl. I've done that on the theory that it doesn't matter to the mental game what the tactical game is. I'm basing this off my observation about war movies - take "Enemy at the Gate" for instance. It is a love story. Yes it's set in the Stalingrad but the underlaying emotional theme is love story. That is what drives all the action. I suspect that most movies have similar seemingly incompatible underlying themes. So the tactical game is irrelevant for design purposes. It is very important for marketing purposes but irrelevant for design purposes. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - escalating the conflict is the next challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237897/#Comment_237897" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T11:24:18+00:00" title="October 16, 2009 11:24AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a consequence of having more and more conflicts and crises I think I'll reduce the likelyhood of actions happening. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the game the referee decides how likely an action is to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally likely - roll 2 to 6 on 1d6<br/>\nPretty likely - 3-6<br/>\nOkay - 4-6<br/>\nPretty unlikely - 5-6<br/>\nReally unlikely - 6<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on hoe many problems a character has the ref will be instructed that they can't rate an action better than "pretty likely" "okay" or "pretty unlikely".

The deveoplment was all in a secondary game that is to add "Story Now" effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach character starts with two emotional problems. A "Conflict" which is an interpersonal problem and a Crisis which is an existential problem (like "I hate myself.")<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen players make regular actions in the game if they fail their roll they get a new problem added to their list. So the stakes in all action is "Succeed or feel bad."<br/>\n<br/>\nA player would pick another player to make up a new conflict or crisis for them. This automatically happens because it is just a thought. Players could even just mark an x to show increased stress (a useful option fo those who don't like being very creative.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs players add more and more conflicts and crises they hit "break points". Players can opt to just lose a turn (the non-creative solution) or make an action to deal with their internal shit. This could be a healthy move (doing cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself - "I'll be okay. It will all work out...") or they could enact a social disaster. A player would face break downs more and more as the got under more stress and the highest possible rating people could give to their other actions would be dropped to "Pretty Likely" and then "Okay". <br/>\n<br/>\nI though - Hey I've got a premise "Deal with your shit while trying to save the world." An inevitable outcome - everyone cracks if put under enough stress. A consequence for failing rolls - increased stress and a way to get players to enact their stresswith breakdown actions. I even had a simplified version that would allow non- story gamers to play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I looked at this and realized it is SOOOO balanced, SOOOO reasonable, SOOOO stable. It was my static tendency all over again. There is no escalation in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThsi kicker is that these are basically good rules - I'm certain I'll use something of them but they don't reach my goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the drawing board...<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how other people are affected by their internal tendencies?

It makes the characters look like they are only just holding on at the start of the story - holding on hurts them so saving the world could mean destroying themselves. This is more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens if a person can't hold on? They would not be failing rolls so they would not be building up stress. That would mean no more breakdowns so if effect the only thinkg they are losing is being involved with the story... not very escalatey is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople destroy themselves if they stay and save the world. Breaking down would mean what? Why would it be so horrible? Why put it off, especially if it saves your life? <br/>\n<br/>\n"Can you hold on long enough to save the world?" <br/>\n<br/>\nLogically if you don't then the world isn't saved. You die anyway (or face the worst outcome the twist gives). How does this fit in how the players are relating to one another. Right now I have the players basically playing a sadistic game inflicting pain on innocent characters. This needs to be done for a reason. I'm just not certain what it is yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see Dogs in the Vineyard and Sorcerer as eventually driving their characters off a moral cliff. They go too far and it destroys them. In their hubris they challenge the gods power of justice and control. What is the hubris of holding on? <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I have a mental health simulator.

Static is death that is for certain.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I'm trying to do is make rules that don't just allow players to create a good story but which guide them into it. The basics of the tile game lead players into a perfectly functional mission with a twist game (a very similar effect to "Betrayal at House on the Hill" a deeply flawed board game which I like.) It's a game but not really a story game. <br>\n<br>\nI've come up with some simple rules that I think make a story and assure that things are always happening because another maxim of stories is that no action also means death.<br>\n<br>\nOn the death thing - characters can only be killed by their own player - UNLESS they are overloaded with stress...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers are faced with the stressful premise "Can you hold it together while you save the world?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unavoidable doom they face is that everyone breaks down when put under too much stress. They can put this off but in the end death catches up to all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters are inherently flawed. They each come with a build in interpersonal conflict and an existential crisis. This helps players know how to run any given character.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen players fail an individual action roll the stress rules kick in. They can 1. Let their stress grow (but this will eventually make them lose turns and eventually be kicked out of the game.) 2. They can pick another player to add a new conflict or crisis to their character (collaborating authorship of the character.) 3. Make an action to try and control or reduce their stress. Or 4. Make an action describing how their characters acts out one of their conflicts or crises which does not reduce stress (but which assures they stress level doesn't go up and which gives them an automatic victory point.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen stress goes up players hit breakdown points. They may 1. lose their turn or 2. make an action to control their stress or act out a crisis. If they reach their final break point they can no longer make individual actions save one - to describe how they die. They may move their character around to get in just the right spot so their death counts but die they must. <br/>\n<br/>\nI need to stream line these rules a little but essentially they make certain things happen. If the players are already mixing things up in the mission part of the game that's cool.  If they fail rolls it means they get to deal with their inner lives (which players would never "waste" actions on otherwise). Players are rewarded for acting out their crises (rather than doing healthy coping moves) so people's inner lives can spill out into the action game. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not quite as "Story Now" as Dogs in the Vineyard but I can see the game working without the stress rules and having an emotional level with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've got a first full draft of the rules written. Now I need to make a game to test them in. Fortunately I've already got all the production side down. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239555/#Comment_239555" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T22:12:26+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 10:12PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris:<br/><br/>Have you heard about the Montesegur game? I only mention it because there are apparently some end-states for characters ( some of them quite tragic) that are required, but aren't specifically assigned ahead of time. Might that help in the context of EMGs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239615/#Comment_239615" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T10:11:14+00:00" title="October 29, 2009 10:11AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting game... I remember learning about the Cathars and Albegensians in college. They had some odd Manachian views and there was no good explanation how esssentially Persian religious ideas ended up in Southern France. Decidedly not Christian. "Kill them all God will know his own." said the Count of Toulouse.<br/><br/>I followed the links and see how some of the games I'm working on now (a presecripted ten turn Matrix Game) looks a little like a Jeepform game. I imagine we use different play techniques but I agree with a lot of their ideas. <br/><br/>When it comes to the tile placement game I don't think it is quite like that. There is a mission and a twist that triggers a set end game but that is to get a tactical dust up going. The emotional development stuff is separate. I'll try and pull my thoughts together to start a new thread so we can let this one die. I think it's run its course.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
