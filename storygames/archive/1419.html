                    I just put up an AP report from <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21541.new#new" rel="nofollow">last night's TSOY session</a>, the first in a mini-campaign deal I'm running.  I'm super happy about it.  <br/><br/>It's set during the Klondike gold rush and set in Skagway, Alaska, a time and place I'm very familiar with.  I was surprised at the depth of detail I was dredging up during the game, and found myself really enjoying a mental return visit to the region I haven't been around in six years.  That, combined with my love and knowledge of that time in history, seemed to bring the game to life for me.  It helped that I'm in a great group that is always game to go along with whatever scheme I come up with, but the fact that this particular game is rooted in something I know a ton about seems important and awesome.  <br/><br/>Have you participated in games in which you were essentially a subject matter expert?  Did it help or hinder play?                </div>

Oh, yes, that online BtI thing with Emily. We set it in San Francisco, which I know really well, and we destroyed the city at the end. So landmarks kept appearing: the Golden Gate Bridge got destroyed, someone was running down the Castro, they end up on top of the Transamerica Pyramid.<br/><br/>It's interesting, isn't it, that although your question was about subject matter, we've all described <i>regions</i> we knew really well (assuming Vax was talking about maps of regions). I think setting something in a known location is very powerful.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I'm a physicist. It is astonishing the number of times this has come in absolutely useless in every role-playing game ever, because no one gives a shit how the real world works. They just want bogus quantum physics or relativity descriptions for how their bullshit science might be real science. Ditto for my martial arts experience that tells me it is damn near impossible to jump-kick two guys at once.<br/><br/>Not that I really mind these things - I'm not <i>complaining</i> that no one wants a realistic game, I'm just <i>noting</i> it.<br/><br/>It did come in handy that I knew about Boston during a Mage game I ran, though. And knowing the name of the local all-night liquor store was mindblowingly useful in Vampire LARPs, back when I still played them.                        </div>

                            The difference, Colin, is that what I know is color.  People DO care how the real world works, but only in so far that it does not impede the other things they want out of the game.<br/><br/>When I narrate a grove of birches so close together that the riders have to get off the horses to squeeze between the trees, that's not telling anyone they can't be cool... especially when the samurai decides he's just going to pull out his ubersharp katana and slice off any trunk that gets in their way.<br/><br/>When you say "...but it's damn near impossible to jump-kick two guys at once..." you're telling them they can't be cool.<br/><br/>And that's not cool.                        </div>

                            I know lots about things like Celts, India, Literature and these things are all useful in so much as I use them to make the game cool, and not useful anytime I try to be a stickler. <br/><br/>So I say, "Hey, rajputs are cool. They fight with curvy swords and have crazy codes of honor!' People go "Yea! I wanna play a rajput!" <br/><br/>So I say, "Actually, the truth is that a Sikh can't be a brahmin, as Sikh's aren't Hindu.

                            Good point - history and geography are fun until you get hung up on accuracy and verisimillitude.  Which can be problematic if you're designing a game about, say, Polish boy scouts fighting Nazis on 27 July, 1944, where ground truth actually matters.  We talk about this in our most recent D3 podcast.                        </div>

Sometimes cold reality can be awesome. It's not good in a game of Feng Shui, but what about GURPS: Black Ops? It would be much cooler if the GM was like, "Hey, yeah that'd probably not be good. In fatc, it'd be a +6 penalty. You're wearing full ops gear, and it's just really hard to do effectively.  Instead, you might try something like throw one into the other, or lock the first guy's wrist while you side-kick the second, then come back and clothesline the first." etc.<br/><br/>In the spirit of Say Yes or Roll the Dice (which I don't Always belive in; just most of the time for most games), I'd say, "Uh, sure, though it's kind of a bad move compared to X, Y, or Z. -3 die penalty).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Fred, I think the difference is quantifiable.  I've forded glacial run-off, and I know what it looks like and feels like.  It might not occur to you that you can't see the bottom for the silt, and that's both fun color and a potential extra challenge.  This is more about physical experience than expertise, so how about this - having pored over photographs of Skagway circa 1898, I can describe the tents and buildings, what people are wearing, the mud and Mt. Hoffman in the background.  It's all readily available in my head, where if I was running a game in Greyhawk I'd be able to say anything, and as a result probably say nothing, or speak in bland generalities.  At the same time our game's Skagway already bears the imprint of the other players and isn't perfectly accurate any more - it's ours, for our game.                        </div>

                            I see what Jason's saying there; it's a different kind of strength you're bringing as the 'subject matter expert' on a fictional setting -- not necessarily less or more, but different -- Jason's pulling up real-world experience as knowledge... if I'm running something in my 'Duchy of Caer Maighdean', I'm making stuff up.<br/><br/>Now, I might be able to tell you about all of the Duchess's family members, and that she goes armed and armored most places, and how her family is as much or more descended from the local northern barbarian tribes than from the conquering nobility of the south, and how that ties in with the ancient tombs-beneath-the-cemetery near the capitol city and the former ruling family tinged with ogre blood and alliances with dark sorcery, but it... well, it's fiction.<br/><br/>If I lay down how it feels to cross a snow-melt stream, the way Jason is, even in that fictional setting, I'm reaching into my personal experience of that event -- still, real-world experience.  If the Duchess's hair falls a certain way, and she uses a particular facial expression when she's thinking, and turns her wine glass between her fingers just so... that's a mesh of my real-life experience as well, retasked for the purpose.<br/><br/>There's... cold hard facts... and those moments of verisimilitude that they create... I dunno -- I'm not sure those are moments you can wholly achieve without at least a few 'real' elements woven into the fiction.<br/><br/>You create from what you know, y'know?  <br/><br/>I think creating something new out of 'real' bits you know is one of the coolest things creators do, really -- contructing a very real-feeling place that simply doesn't exist anywhere but in the fiction.                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's Clinton's argument on our podcast - lift the good bits from real life but abstract it into a fictional setting with real themes, rather than try to do justice to history and reality.  I don't know - generic fantasy, as an example, is pretty fuzzy for me.  I'd never think "Hey, this is a glacially fed stream" and let personal knowledge kick in.  I'd think "fantasy stream", like "fantasy bridge" or "fantasy pony".  I'm sure everyone parses it differently.                        </div>

<p>I wanna side with Colin here.  As a real world computer geek, I need to suppress my expertise in games that relate to technology, playing or running.  I made a bad mistake a while ago letting a player decide to be a hacker in a gritty realistic game we were playing, and the paradigm clash was frustrating for everybody.</p>
<p>I think the fact of the matter is that fiction doesn't deal accurately with certain fields, like the hard sciences, and this differs from every other field of endeavor because people want it that way.  A can totally see "a Sikh can't be a Brahmin" being halfway cool, because there'd be a sense of verisimilitude,  which would penetrate my shameful ignorance of the culture.  But it seems like How Science Really Works or Operating Systems Fundamentals just wrecks havoc with plot, and doesn't provide a feeling of the real.</p>
<p>As a separate matter, technology in general is hard to bring to the table without it feeling like I'm wielding a blunt instrument.  Whack!  Computers don't work that way, but they do work this way!  Whack!  I know this stuff way more than you!  Whack!  Because, in general my fellow players have no basis for judgment about what I'm saying, so anything in the technology field, if I speak up, is gospel.  Within the field I have an extra-systemic narrative authority, which isn't really fair.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, I probably have the completely opposite role regarding martial arts.  And firearms.  I like my fictional violence fictional, and some of my most frustrating sessions have been with gun nuts who exercised the blunt instrument.  And to a much lesser degree, martial arts practitioners.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, I've at least had a tangential exposure to Indian culture.  I've spent enough time in natural settings that I can visualize and be awed by fording glacial runoff.  (Aside: Dude!)  I feel like I could usefully assess that input in a game, and be able to say "Wow!  That's awesome to know, and makes the whole setting more vibrant,"  or "How does this advance what we're doing here, really?"</p>

                            As a related aside,<br/><br/>1) I have a friend who spent 6 years in the navy as an engineer aboard a fast-attack nuclear submarine and for a long time had trouble letting go of his real world knowledge in favor of gaming fun. It even prevented him from watching movies about underwater action (U-571, Sphere, et al) because it would piss him off.<br/><br/>2) My wife is Russian, as in born and raised there, and we simply cannot watch any movie that purports to take place in Russia, deals with Russian culture, or anything like it. It angers her to see how badly portrayed Russia and Russians are in such movies.<br/><br/>(As an aside to my aside, I once suggested to both my friend and my wife, that we watch Hunt for Red October...which didn't go over well)<br/><br/>EDIT: I have however, used both of their knowledge when I was constructing various adventures, so it has come in handy.                        </div>

<p>Fred, for me, being the SME is a lot more interesting when I'm expert about a fictive thing.</p>
<p>Most particularly, when I'm dealing with something I made up, I <em>know</em> that it's streamlined to only include things that interest and compel me, and all the sort of picky environmental details are things that enhance that impact. It's pre-threshed, free of all that chaff that tends to accumulate around non-fiction (and the fiction of people who aren't me).</p>
<p>I feel like, in many ways, real-life experience poisons my play by making people worry about verisimilitude and other such things, wrapping them up in their own knowledge, when actually they should be worrying about having fun with the rest of the people at the table.</p>

                            How applicable is familiarity with genre to this conversation?<br/><br/>Right now I'm immersing myself in the Bible and Mahabharata for "research," as it were, for an Exalted campaign I might run. (And/or purporting to prepare for an Exalted campaign as excuse to immerse myself in the Bible and Mahabharata.) And I'm reading a bit of Nietzsche along with it. I might start a "Genre Workshop" thread when I have something sufficiently interesting to say, since I'm sure everyone else will.<br/><br/>The corollary to all of this is that I can't really go into genres I don't know, at least if the analogy with RW knowledge holds. If that campaign comes into being it won't be heavily anime-influenced, since I don't have any familiarity with that genre. Unless my players want to add some in, which would of course be cool.<br/><br/>I suppose "genre research" has the benefit of providing things to mine for description without dicating things over which to argue. In theory, at least.                        </div>

                            I've camped and hiked in the Sierras practically all my life. Whenever a game I'm running ends up in mountains, I draw up my knowledge of the Sierras and use it in description and set fictional locals using a real location as a basis. However, no amount of description on my part ever completes the mental image and memory in my head for another player, because he is using his own experiences to paint the picture in his head. <br/><br/>Which is precisely why I've started using actual pictures of places as handouts. A picture is worth a thousands words and all that.                        </div>

                            I think that for <strong>running</strong> a campaign, knowledge (just in general) is extremely useful.  I think for <strong>designing</strong> ignorance breeds 1) creativity, and 2) patience in teaching others.   Heck, I work at a welding supply.  I could tell you all <em>sorts</em> of fun things for post-modern apocalyptic games... but my assumptions mean I'm going to jump places where the average RPG reader (who probably has heard the term 'oxyacetylene' and knows the semiplausible scene in "Aliens") may not have the science or, ahem, welding experience to say, "Yeah, that's practical."  On the other hand, it's surprising what gases some people think are combustible...                        </div>

This topic meshes well with our last D3 podcast, and the deal with me and the TSOY setting: everything in it is based off something I know well (well, most of it - Maldor's just the fantasy lands of any fantasy game.) None of the areas are exactly like anywhere I've been, but are adaptations. When I run a game in Khale, I know what the light looks like through the trees - it looks just like it did the whole time I lived in Alabama, running around in our forests all day. The swamps of Ammeni look just like the swamps of southern Louisiana, and the towns and cities all look like Korea.                        </div>

                            Jason's authenticity strategy: change the setting in which he's uncomfortably NOT the expert into the setting in which he IS.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Contrariwise, I've at least had a tangential exposure to Indian culture.  I've spent enough time in natural settings that I can visualize and be awed by fording glacial runoff.  (Aside: Dude!)

That's awesome to know, and makes the whole setting more vibrant,"  or "How does this advance what we're doing here, really?"</blockquote>
I think this bit is really interesting, along with Jason's comment about "fantasy ponies." It suggests that the expertise/experience/expectations of the audience also plays an important factor in these sort of interactions. If I don't know what glacial runoff looks like, someone else's narration about so and so fording it is going to have a lessened impact than if I share at least some version of that experience. It doesn't really matter how much of an expert they are or aren't. If they're trying to make some sort of subtle point with their expertise -- for example, an oblique reference to what kind of paintings some NPC has on his walls -- it's possible that I will miss it completely.<br/><br/>Similarly, in areas where nobody has any direct experience, different standards are going to apply -- I can get away with talking about reversing the quantum spin of an atom or hacking into the CIA mainframe from my iBook while skateboarding out of a helicopter.                        </div>

Careful.  You went from "sing with authenticity" as something that a GM might want to do to assuming that authenticity-singing was a fundamentally desired quality in GMs.  Some games may not require or benefit from that authenticity.  If we're playing the Matrix, we are in Generic Grungy City.  There very literally are no authentic details, here.  The setting is all broad strokes, because that's what's necessary for the game.<br/><br/>So are people with more and varied life experiences better able to make a wider range of game experiences seem more authentic?  Yeah, sure.  But I doubt glacier-jumping Jason would be as good at making a game set in Santa Barara authentic as less-varied-experience me who lived there.  So when we come down to a specific game, the generalities aren't very important.                        </div>

                            Hi Joshua,<br/><br/>I disagree.  In the situation you mention with the Matrix, everyone at the table still wants enough of a feeling of authenticity to meet their pesonal and shared standards.  The work needs to get done in order to achieve the result; it's just a question of who does it, and where the standard knob is set.  If the table is ok with broad strokes, then fine.  But, in my experience, the knob is sometimes dialed to something a bit more demanding.  It seems like there's a whole bunch of Gamer Skills which feed into making satisfying play at a higher level of fidelity, but I wonder how many of them demand a bank of life experiences which few of us actually have.<br/><br/>We also seem to be respecting the distinction between "authentic details" and "ficticious but consistent" details.  It may well be that the latter is all you really need, but my impression is that the former is more desirable.  Speaking very broadly, as a community we seem to place more value on authentic details than we do on made-up details.  For the real world, that means we like to get input from people who have lived there, or done that.  For fiction, we would place more credence in Ed Greenwood's Elminster than anyone else's, or in Clinton's TSOY than mine.<br/><br/>Yah?<br/><br/>-JasonN                        </div>

<p>Jason, I think I don't speak only for myself when I say that there are parts of the community that find the constant sniffing after authenticity to be actively distasteful.</p>
<p>Joshua's distinction is one I find essential - there are games where I really want the game to seem like it's "right", and there are games where that's just plain stupid and rains on my fun. Clinton's TSOY is never the TSOY that belongs at my table, unless I am playing with him GMing the game.</p>

                            Shreyas, I don't have an opinion on any constant sniffing after authenticity; I really think the standards vary among players and groups.

To keep us on topic with Jason's TSOY using Skagway, Alaska case -- would you say that his choice to go with what he knew is an example of constant sniffing after authenticity?

I don't know if that question makes a whole lot of sense, but you are accidentally stubbing a sore toe of mine: I've found that more than one gamer has a worldview far enough out of skew with mine that there's an ongoing issue about what's reasonable, and what kind of details are interesting.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm thinking of a friend of mine with whom I roleplayed with for years, who I'm distinctly sure had an anime lens over the SIS, regardless of the game we were playing.  There were little color details that you could pretty much ignore - they were mostly in his head and not really a problem.  But there were cases when we were involved in some kind of somewhat realistic institutional scenario - dealing with a hospital, or financial records, where we would but heads over how the world worked.  Because I was approaching it with hands on experience, and he was coming from anime-land.<br/><br/>As I've expanded my gaming circle, and sat in with other groups and whatnot, I've come to realize that a table does develop a micro-culture, with it's own views of reality, and sometimes there've been nasty clashes as a result.                        </div>

                            Jason, I think you're conflating authenticity and verisimilitude.<br/><br/>You cannot have authenticity when playing the Matrix.  The city of the Matrix does not exist in the real world of you, me, and other players.  Nor is it a city that's really like cities that we know in the real world.  We can layer details so that it <em>seems</em> authentic and true, but that's verisimillitude, not authenticity.<br/><br/>Now, do different tables have different requirements for verisimilitude?  Certainly.  I think it also differs game to game.  When my playtest circle is playing <em>Joy Division</em>, the dial's set pretty low.  When we're playing <em>George's Children</em>, it's pretty high.  The different games have different needs.<br/><br/>Regardless, the point that I was trying to get as is that total range of experience (and capability with authenticity and verisimilitude) is less useful as a metric than depth of experience in the content of a specific game.                        </div>

<p>This quote is what I am responding to. Speaking in the specific, I think this is simply wrong; it may be that it's your use of "details" that I'm objecting to.</p>
<p>That is to say, in the case of Jason's game, I'd be pretty much disinterested in to what extent the game aligns with Jason's experience, except as far as that makes him have fun with it. What I <em>am</em> interested in is the love and energy he puts into the game. Now it happens that Jason is a cool guy, and it seems like that energy isn't diminished by the non-authentic detail that the actual play of the game creates. That's great.</p>
<p>But the fact that the game has 'authenticity' has less than zero sell value to me; in my play experience, 'authenticity' leads to nitpicking and non-fun even among the most positive and healthy groups. It's quite literally toxic. That's where <em>constant</em> sniffing after authenticity comes in; I get interested as soon as it's clear that authenticity is, as with Jason's case, an accidental source of energy, and not something that anyone cares to preserve. That's non-constant, and thereby non-toxic.</p>
<p>Does that help clarify?</p>

                            Do players, _as opposed to GMs_, have a higher tendency to use their expertise against each other, to shut each other down with nitpicking?<br/><br/>Does a GM framing a situation with deep domain experience have less of a nitpicky feel than a GM responding with it in the middle of a situation?<br/><br/>Are we really just talking about setting expectations before entering a conflict?                        </div>

                            I frankly never use any of my professional knowledge when GMing a game. The last damn thing I want to do after a day of "thinking like a lawyer" is come home and do it some more with friends in the context of a game I'm playing to relax.<br/>
<br/>
I use TV or movie versions of the law when legal stuff comes up, and I move on fast. I love my work but it's work.                        </div>

                            I think we might break it down into the sorts of expertise being used.  There is the know-that expertise, which really can get kind of boring except as used for splashes of color (there is a reason we don't have Encyclopedia Britannica: the RPG), then there is the know-how which can be wicked cool when it adds opportunities to the game but frustrating when multiple know-hows conflict (breaks SIS)--often times a 'real world' know how and a 'genre' know how.<br/><br/>I have a friend who has been doing martial arts seriously for some time as well as having worked as a bouncer.  Add that to having close family and personal ties to the realities of military life and violence, and you get a guy who has an amazing sense of what combat looks like.  There is color, yes, in the way the wounds get described, but also 'hooks' in the description that let us who are playing think of interesting ways to further the combat.  <br/><br/>I think this luring you in with opportunity is what people are getting at when they talk about the goodness of authenticity--it shows you some place you can go in the game, even if that someplace is hemmed in a little with limitations from that knowledge.  It is when your knowledge lets you 'see' the opportunities and dynamic possibilities of a thing rather than just as a series of facts.<br/><br/>I'm not sure it's just bad if expertise provides limits--limits are the tools you use to figure out what you can do as much as things that indicate what you can't do.  It seems like the real problem lies in the conflict of what people feel they 'know.'                        </div>

                            Hey Ian, <br/><br/>How do you feel the color I added, based on my real-world experience and familiarity, impacted the game?  (Ian's in my game, y'all).  I'm particularly interested in knowing if it added pressure in any way on you as a player or constrained your narration.                        </div>

                            Hmm, let me see if I can do it justice, Jason:<br/><br/>I got a real sense of the place, and I liked the contrast between Skagway and Fort Haynes.  The silt stuck in my head--it was a small detail that just impressed itself on me for some reason.  I also liked the historical asides you made--even while they didn't directly enter into the SIS, they gave the events in the SIS an added punch.  Knowing that lots and lots of the stake grabbers were going to be dying along the trail...well, it gave the lively excitement of the boat a grim undercurrent.  <br/><br/>It also gave Steve a great chance to play up Annie's resourcefulness--so you have the limit (this is a hard place, you could die) and the opportunity (so we'd better be prepared--Annie goes to the Arctic Brotherhood, figures out what we need...cue NPC who also lets Annie hit some other keys, play up her brokenhearted past a little, and so on).  <br/><br/>So, did it add pressure? Yes, but I think in that mostly good way, that let us think of resources in a real serious way.  When people start failing endurance checks and have to lose something from their pack...well, it was at least in my head that these could be pretty important choices.  It also encouraged us to *do* and engage with the setting.  Then, when we did engage, other knowledge came in handy to provide us with interesting engagements, which started to dovetail with the story elements (like keys).  For me, at least, the knowledge gave the setting some depth, made it feel like it wasn't just window-dressing.<br/><br/>I suspect the conflict between Zeke and the Indians was also partially motivated by that sense of pressure from the setting, in addition to pressure from the character concept.  This is a dangerous place, we *need* help.<br/><br/>It probably constrained some narration, but it didn't feel like contraint, more like opportunity--sure we can't go stomping up the trail without thinking about it, but that means we *get* to feel out the town a little more.  If the town hadn't been interesting in its own right, yeah, I suspect it would have felt a little frustrating, like going through the motions because we had to do it or else.  But it wasn't, at least in part because you had a good sense of the place.                        </div>

I was an EMT in college - for years I was the damage system, a la "Ok, he gets hit here. What happens, Meg?" I love bringing in stuff I really know as a GM or co-GM; as a player, it's more challenging, because I don't have sole say over the fiction.                        </div>

Hold on.  Do you mean that when you do this...<br/><br/>1) ...You're more likely to be "stepping outside your authority", and poking into another person's job?<br/><br/>2) ...Because of the group dynamic, and the way it makes you explain things you're putting into the fiction, it's inconvenient / takes too long / breaks flow?<br/><br/>3) ...Something entirely different?                        </div>
