So you might move one from Near to Far and another from Near to Close. Depends on what works best for your aliens. There's nothing that draws out a Flashback like the GM shifting all the failures to close range when someone's used grenades in the round...<br/><br/>And since the GM might only beat some of the PCs they will likely end up at different ranges during encounters. In the fiction this will be Troopers getting separated from each other, forced into tunnels or rooms, etc.<br/><br/>The PCs who beat the aliens will also be deciding which range they move to while killing. Or they can always Cancel and nix the aliens' success to help out their buddies who rolled crap.<br/><br/>I love grenades, but I love the TPK bomb more! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158250/#Comment_158250" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T18:55:08+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  6:55PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That works.

Under (4) for successes it says:<br/><br/>"If you succeed on FA/AA before your opponent then you can also change range by one step at the end of your turn. Move the PC(s) on the range chart and describe closing or retreating."<br/><br/>So, if you're a player you just read it as FA. If you're the GM then you read it as AA. Note that it specifically doesn't mention NFA as that has its own rule: if you succeed you can just move (whether you get killed doing so, or not, is determined by whether you beat the aliens roll, or not).<br/><br/>Also note that you change range at the end of your turn, i.e. you kill at your current range and then move. (Some of the alien special abilities also allow the aliens to change range in other ways too, which will surprise the PCs the first time they're used).<br/><br/>The cool thing, I hope, will be when you get to play. You'll see the choices at each stage of an encounter based on where you are, what you were trying to do and what you (and everyone else) rolled. Those encounter steps are your guide to what happens.<br/><br/>Thanks for the questions, Ben, they're very much appreciated.<br/><br/>[Edit: page 18, I meant, don't know why I typed p.23!]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158373/#Comment_158373" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T09:19:04+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  9:19AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor,<br/>\n<br/>\nDo Officers have access to ALL the resources below their rank?

Normally you will progress up (and down) through the ranks and gain (lose) items as you go. I reckon the APC and TPK bombs are most likely to get used up. It's then up to the PC to decide if they ask for a replacement item using a development roll between missions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone jumps up several ranks via a field promotion then we'd judge as a group, then and there, whether some of the items were available for this mission. For instance, the now-dead Major got fried in his Drop Ship so it's gone, right? But if the old Major hadn't used it then the new Major gets the keys before the next encounter, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is to let your character die (!) and get a replacement PC with a lower rank. They'll come from the mother ship with new stuff for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>&gt;But you can have only one of those "readied" at the start of an encounter...and to switch between them requires a NFA roll?</i><br/>\nA default weapon has to be a weapon from the weapons list (Energy Rifle through to Shotgun).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "One Use Per Planet stuff" isn't in your hand, it's just stuff you call on when you need it and doesn't make you drop your weapon. So you don't need to "ready it" you just choose to use it when you want it.<br/>\nThe TPK and Paradise bombs are grenades, so you can switch to them for free, like grenades.<br/>\nThe vehicles just have "special effects":<br/>\n-the Drop Pods just do their thing. When you get out of the Drop Pod what's your default weapon?<br/>\n-When you're driving the APC you're using an NFA roll each round, but when you exit it what's your default weapon?<br/>\n-When you're piloting the Drop Ship you're using an NFA roll each round, but when you eject what's your default weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone needs to know what the default _weapon_ your PC is carrying for when they get out of the vehicle (because that could be at any range and that might be crucial).<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging weapons, by the way, can be a pain in the ass, since (i) you might not be successful at it, (ii) you might get killed while trying to do it, and (iii) it doesn't remove any Threat Tokens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>&gt;When an alien ability prevents all kills, does that prevent the loss of the token that a trooper success would have removed, as well as not letting them count the kills?</i><br/>\nWell, there are three Special Abilities that do this kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Armour" allows me to say "no kills this round and all the Threat Tokens stay there!". The attacks just fail to get through the Armour. I'd use it as soon as the dice hit the table and I see how successful PCs have been. If I use it after you've killed then that's my fault for not calling on it earlier - it's not retroactive.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Stop Technology" I'd use after seeing what the PCs had rolled too. If I use it after you've killed then that's just stupid by me as the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Regeneration" I'd use at the end of the round after the PCs had cause a load of kills, or before they remove the final Threat Token and end the encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr was there another ability this was specifically about? (It was Armour I think?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>&gt;Can this be retroactive (for the abilities that prevent all kills in a round, for example)?</i><br/>\nNo. If they've been killed they've been killed. Unless you're using "Regeneration" which specifically details what happens (you keep the kills) but the creatures reform and the Threat Tokens are returned to the encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>&gt;Just to verify: range has no effect on Troopers resisting alien attacks. You are just as likely to take damage no matter where you are, right?</i><br/>\nRight. Aliens cause kills at all ranges on a successful AA roll. Unless you're at Far Range and the ability "Reduce Visibility" is being used.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>&gt;A few character sheet suggestions (if you happen to make revised versions for download):</i><br/>\n<i>&gt;- You might to add a tick box for combat drugs just like armor, since everyone can use them once per planet</i><br/>\nGreat idea!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>&gt;- Would also be good to have a place to list the orders and special powers a particular character could use (force weakness, e-vac, orbital bombardment)</i><br/>\nGood idea. Ralph Mazza also suggested cards that could be printed out and put on the table or held in your hand. I will try and make those and have them as PDF downloads.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>&gt;Love the presentation of the strength/weakness on the character sheet. Very logical.</i><br/>\nThanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158543/#Comment_158543" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T08:27:36+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  8:27AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2008 8:31AM by Z-Dog.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor,<br>\n<br>\nSuggestion about the char sheet from last night's game:<br>\n<br>\none guy thought it'd be cool if there were little pictures of the medals you can win with check marks next to them<br>\n<br>\noh, and while I'm thinking about it: have a list of the default gear on the sheet would be a good idea                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158566/#Comment_158566" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T09:56:34+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  9:56AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

The only question asked above that I didn't immediately know the answer to was the one on officers getting all of the devices of the previous ranks as well.<br><br>(Actually, I'd thought the answer to that was no...if your LT gets promoted, he no longer has a Drop Pod, better hope someone else gets promoted to LT or you won't have one any more...would have been my answer)<br><br>But the rest of the questions are pretty clear in the text as long as you trust the text to mean what it says.  i.e. where it says "prevent kills" trust that if it meant "prevents kills and token loss" that it would have said "kills and token loss" and therefor conclude that it doesn't prevent token loss.<br><br>If it were me, and the way I write rules...I'd have specified (probably 4 times in three different places)...but then that's why 3:16 is fun to read and my rules read like a text book.<br><br>So basically, the rules are extremely precise in what they say.  If you don't assume they mean more than what they say you should be fine 9 times in 10.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158652/#Comment_158652" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T14:23:35+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  2:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, Paul, it's a tight system, and as written it's great.

Preventing the person from racking up any more kills.  And wasting a "saving throw" so a rival is one step closer to death.  See pages 32, 25, and 89<br><br>On replacements, its the second... "The Flashbacks your dead PC had \u201cUsed\u201d are also \u201cUsed\u201d for your new PC except that one Strength is made \u201cAvailable\u201d again." on page 36.<br><br>On the arbitrariness of the second level up...right.  From a game fiction perspective...this is the army dude...its not supposed to make sense.  From a game play perspective, part of the idea of the game is dysfunctional relationships between the Troopers...like the resentment you get when you do all the work but someone else gets all the levels.  From a game mechanic perspective, it works perfectly with the AA calculations...AND it makes sure that players who want to level are well motivated to KILL and not rely on the whim of the dice.<br><br>On Ignore Wounds.  It says exactly what it does.  Spend a Threat Token to ignore kills.  No kills means no Threat Token loss...except the one you spent to power the ability (probably taken from general stock).  It works exactly like Armor, but where Armor is used only once per encounter, Ignore wounds can be used many times per encounter.  Keep spending the Threat Tokens and you can pretty much guarentee someone will have to spend a Strength to get out of the Encounter.<br><br>On Regeneration...since it does not say "once per encounter" the way other "once per encounter" abilities do...<br><br>On the Coccooning...what do you think should happen?  This is an RPG afterall.  Do they go after him?  Do they leave him there? Does he try to escape on his own?  How does he get out of the cocoon...probably an NFA roll...although if he wanted to pop a grenade and take a Kill himself...I'd probably allow it, no problem.  Just Role Play it like you would any game.  See the GM advice on page 49.<br><br>Hope that helps.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159050/#Comment_159050" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T06:34:47+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  6:34AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ralph.<br>\nOn force weakness: yeah, I knew about those things, I was just wondering if still there was some tactical or strategic benefit to the group as a whole.

I'd be happy with that interpretation.<br><br>The examples of using a "0" kill weapon to change range are on p. 75. Both times it doesn't work out for him, for different reasons!<br><br>Yes, I missed Ignore Wounds. As GM I'd be wary of spending all my Threat Tokens on "ignoring" repeatedly, but I'd do it to give the PCs a hard time. Some planets are harder than others. And if you cause 0 kills the GM is not going to let you take any Threat Tokens away.<br><br>In the (unlikely) event of two characters killing the same number of things then what does the group feel is the right answer? Do they feel both should go up, or only one? I'd say both should go up as they were the (equal) highest killers. Does that then take away the random slot, or not? I wouldn't say so, but maybe the group might feel it does.<br/><br/>And if your group doesn't like Force Weakness then they should up front rule it out. I think that's weak, though. It's often a grunts only chance to avoid the Major TPK Bombing the party when they're out of Strengths or Weaknesses themselves.<br/><br/>Force Weakness is your action for the round, but if you're successful then it is a successful NFA roll so you could change weapon. I'd be open to persuasion for you successfully changing range too if it fitted (Let's get out of here, the Captain's going to go nuts...). Maybe it wouldn't?<br/><br/>The thing with NFA rolls is what does the group think can be achieved on your turn. Dig a whole series of trenches? Or just a foxhole? Grab the dilithium crystals, dash across the courtyard and into the bunker? Or just grab the damn crystals and take cover? I can't tell you a fixed answer. It's up to the group to decide if the fictional stuff is achieved. Game mechanically, the rules say that if you are successful on NFA then you can change range and change weapon. There are lots of other things you can do with NFA. Maybe you try to get a bonus on your next roll? That's in the book too for the GM to give out. But the group will know what they think can be done when you're there in game.<br/><br/>The secondray level increase is arbitrary, but then again so is the amount of kills you cause. Some guy takes out 6 Threat Tokens for 8 kills and you level up with a roll of 9 on a d10 for some grenades and Ipissy Threat Token. Where's the justice?! The levelling isn't there to reward a growing competence (the Development Rolls and auto-increase to a weapon do that for everyone). They are there to push some characters ahead of others, free up more Flashbacks (and therefore promotions) and raise the stakes. AA will go up as the FAs and NFAs go up, perhaps unfairly on those who haven't yet levelled up. It's there to provoke fictional stuff, not reward good soldiering.<br/><br/>If a group wants a system that is "fairer" then they can work something out. I would say that the random increase really makes good things happen in the fiction.<br/><br/>On getting coccooned... you've seen Aliens, right? They get to him and that's when you have the encounter. Or give him an encounter on his own, limited to 2 x No.of PCs (i.e. 2 Threat Tokens). Or, or... anything. I'm sure your play group would have a different idea on what is going to happen depending on who it was that was cocooned. You might even be ordered to get him back if it is an unpopular Officer. The currency says that there are 5 x No. of players in Threat Tokens for a planet, so there should be plenty to spend. But it's up to the GM how those are spent, not the guy that wrote the book.<br/><br/>The Brigadier could tell you how to get to Bridagier, but then he'd have to kill you.

The first had two players, so naturally leveling wasn't a problem ("okay trooper, roll to see if you get the random level - ding, you win again!"), but in the second game we had four players and there was already a sense that the leveling felt unsatisfying.<br/><br/>As you said, people roll badly in combat too and where's the justice in that, but the difference is bad rolls during the mission get explained as part of the fiction -- you say how missed the bugs or were trying to unjam your rifle. I suppose you could encourage people to explain how they did (or didn't) learn from what happened, but it still seems like weak sauce.<br/><br/>Unlike most rolls it's also a permanent penalty. If you miss a roll in combat, you can gnash your teeth but try to make up for it next round. It's not the end of the world. But missing leveling for a mission is a big missed opportunity, since FA / NFA / strengths are critical your ability to influence events in the game. I think from the player point of view it feels a little like adding insult to injury (the parallel from old D&amp;D is rolling a 1 on hit points when you level up).<br/><br/>I also think it distracts from competition instead of inspiring it -- you should be focusing on getting the most kills, but instead everyone gets distracted by how lame it was they lost out to a random roll.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>The levelling isn't there to reward a growing competence (the Development Rolls and auto-increase to a weapon do that for everyone).

Leveling absolutely reflects growing competence and doesn't seem positioned to provoke fictional stuff.<br/><br/>On the other hand the development roll vs NFA to get rank or gear works great -- it makes sense in the fiction that the decisions of supply and command are arbitrary. You may deserve to make Lieutenant but you're just passed over. Too bad. That becomes the story. We had _many_ failed rolls and the players wept but they loved it. It made sense to them that the gruff sergeant got passed over promotion, or that those bastards in the armory wouldn't give them a flame thrower.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my impression of player reaction after two game sessions: the game is lots of fun, but random leveling is a weak point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159202/#Comment_159202" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T15:43:48+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  3:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2008 3:44PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another key point: the game is competitive and based on decisions and stats. The development rolls (which work) are not competitive in the sense that everyone is rolling independently, not against each other, though the long term benefits can aid in future competitions. It mirrors the action of the rest of the game, which is not directly competitive (we are working together to kill bugs, but I want to do better than you)<br/><br/>Then you have the secondary leveling roll, which is directly competitive, winner take all, but has nothing to do with player decisions or character stats.<br/><br/>I think if you made a micro-game and said "it's competitive, but you don't influence the results" the flaws would be pretty obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159203/#Comment_159203" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T15:51:37+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  3:51PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a little brainstorming here's a quick house rule for leveling:<br/><br/>- after every mission give yourself an experience tick<br/>- when you have two ticks immediately trade them in to level<br/>- if you have the highest kills for a mission, gain a level but do not gain a tick<br/><br/>Given a reasonable party size I think that comes out close to the progression of the current system, but without the chance of really lopsided results.

But here's why I really LOVE the random leveling.  Bear with me, this will get a little rambly.<br/><br/>Ok, so we all know the game isn't about a celebration of soldiering prowess.  Right there on your character sheet from day one is "Hatred for Home" as the ultimate Flashback.  We all know that on a superficial level...mowing down legions of bugs is damn fun...there's Trooper Dog's classic quote in the book about killing being the second most fun thing.  But then you have things like Force Weakness...and "field promotions"...and TPK Grenades...and examples of PvP fighting.  So we know that there's supposed to be a certain amount of dysfunction between the characters.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of mechanics that give players a small taste of the shit the characters are going through.  I'm a big believer that keeping the in game fiction and the meta game situation seperate can actualy be an obstacle to truly experiencing the character.  That's why things like playing in your home town in Dirty Secrets is such a powerful tool...or having the Transgressions in Spione being real things done by the real people at the table.  Its those little connections that tie you the player to the character that can really make the experience come alive. <br/><br/>For me random leveling does just that.  Life as a grunt in war time is shit.  Its a bunch of tedious crap interspersed with moments of terror...for little pay, and (especially for the 3:16) no real purpose.  Random leveling gives us just the tiniest taste of that injustice.  Just the tiniest bit of "what the fuck that's bullshit" at the meta level carries down into how we portray our characters at the in-fiction level.  Its a GOOD THING if your players feel a little cheated...vaguely unsatisfied...as if the system just isn't fair.  YES...go with that.  Use that.  Fuel your game play with petty grudges against the player who got lucky enough to level 2 missions in a row even though in the fiction he did exactly jack shit.<br/><br/>Don't shirk from that uncomfortable feeling...embrace it.  And don't worry about it being "backwards" because its supposed to represent growing competence, yadda yadda yadda.  That's just simulation carry over thinking.  Its not supposed to be anything...except a totally arbitrary mechanic for dishing out rewards injustly.  It doesn't need to make "in-fiction" sense...embrace its meta-nature and bring it back with your to the fiction. <br/><br/>That's why I find it appealing.  A house rule that seeks to make leveling more "fair" so that players are more satisfied I think really misses the boat.  Your suggestion probably won't break anything mechanically...but I think it would diminish the game pretty severely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159279/#Comment_159279" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T02:16:58+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  2:16AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Umm, you can house rule it if you want, but you'll end up with some safe and fair way of levelling up, just like D&amp;D (what's the exchange rate of kobolds to level?).<br/><br/>Believe me Shannon's character Dog merely disliked Malcolm's Lt Frinks until he jubilantly, and unfairly, levelled up ahead of Dog.

Raaaaaarrrr!<br/>\n<br/>\nLevelling isn't really about progression at all. <br/>\nLevel is not a measure of height, but depth. <br/>\nIt's about tracking your character's descent...into madness - their location on the spiralling *downward* path to burning, icy Hatred for Home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that a level gives you FA, NFA and Flashbacks is simply a sign that insanity does have its benefits. :)<br/>\nIf you like, the more crazed war is making you, the more you draw on hidden reserves of physical and psychological strength or expose yourself to the demons of weakness within.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd coming back to the unfairness thing - there is no rationality about people cracking up in a war zone. <br/>\nIn the game's simulation of the process, the people who embrace the madness and killkillkill will 100% crack up faster and more reliably. <br/>\nEveryone else...well some people crack, some don't, it's just the luck of the draw. <br/>\nYou tell me: Who are the luckier ones? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nG                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159462/#Comment_159462" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T13:05:31+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  1:05PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the randomness of the game can be crazy frustrating but then we found that that gets all taken out in play on each other. When we got the chance, we'd screw each other for kills/promotions/etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nKinda reminded me of High School in Space: all these petty, crazy frustrations getting taken out on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Officer kept screwing everyone out of their kills? Of course they nominated his ass for a demotion when he used a weakness!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what I like is it can go both ways: My friend called me up and said, "Man, maybe I shouldn't have screwed people out of their kills?" And I was like, "Well, that's up to you, man!"<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the game is really summed up in the description for The Device: basically, one player can, then and there, choose to end the entire campaign. All those hopes and dreams. Why? 'Cause he's the best? No. 'Cause it's the Right Thing To Do?

That way you'd still be helping the team by removing Threat Tokens, but it would at least put a damper on your racking up of kills.

But if you elect to upgrade your E-Cannon's Far Range stat...you're being a real team player (in the sense that now you can remove Threat Tokens at any range - because you can always drop to HtH or Grenades at Close)...but you're hosing yourself for your own kill total, because now anyone who wins the Dominance Roll can stick you out there in BFE-land where you're only getting 1 Kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy sticking you at Close you're getting the same kill range as me with my Energy Rifle at Near, and any of the other Troopers who've been rolling lucky on their 1d10 Energy Rifle roll can be stuck out at Far because the E-Rifle starts with a 1 at that range band.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really makes Weapon Upgrades and development rolls pretty key...and REALLY balances out the guy who goes FA 8, NFA 2...cuz he's going to have a heck of a time winning Dominance Rolls or making range change rolls.

For instance, "troopers are genetically engineered and are already peak human specimens with engram-implanted training. More advanced improvements are available, but being expensive, they are in limited supply. Two troopers out of each unit are chosen to benefit after each mission; the one gets the greatest Kills, and another who the higher-ups think deserve it - and since the army is dysfunctional, this is determined randomly." Such an aproach also opens up the possibility of 'faulty' improvements: in-mission malfunctions, and the like <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, though, I don't like it anyway - the effect is too arbitrary across the campaign, when dealing with a player-base that may be changing in size. Say, one session we may have two players, the next six. I also don't like the fact that the levelling system means that the fewer players you have, the shorter your campaign will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm considering something like this: after every mission roll d10; if you get above a number (N) you advance in level. N will be calculated using one of the following methods, or something like it:<br/>\n<br/>\nN = Number of Available or Used Flashbacks. (So, at the start of the game, it is always 2)<br/>\nN = 5 + [Number of Available and Used Strengths]<br/>\nN = 6 + [Number of Used Strengths]<br/>\n<br/>\n...or something<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm partial to the middle one. It starts out at 50%, but rapidly rises. After 4 missions or so, you're at the same average advancement rate as the standard rules for a 4-player group, and soon after that, there is <i>greater</i> pressure to get the most kills than in the written rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159613/#Comment_159613" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T17:10:43+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  5:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I've read the whole game now, but I read it pretty quickly, so I apologize if any of my questions are addressed in the book.<br><br>Can you make an FA roll if your weapon does 0 kills at the current range?<br>Somewhere I saw that Threat tokens are "removed for kills" so if the answer to the above is "yes" does it remove Threat?

They're about trying to second guess when and where you'd use things in the fiction, right?<br><br>Here's my take on it.<br><br>If you ever get to go to Spain you should. If you go to Spain, and I did, then you should definitley visit Barcelona. I can say from experience that it's a great city. If you're in Barcelona you should absolutely head to see Gaudi's <i>Sagrada Familia</i>, his unfinished cathedral. I'm afraid of heights so I didn't go up a tower, but that's OK because you can see really cool stuff in the basement, and you should go down there. Because in the basement they have this construction that Gaudi made. It's a model of the cathedral made of string and bags of sand. Each one models the load on each pillar and tower. It's a marvellous thing, and shows how Gaudi intrictaley planned the cathedral with all the loads and strains carefully measures.<br><br>Consider the rules in 3:16 as strings and bags of sand. You can cut a string or fuck about with a bag of sand. But on your own head be it. The strings and bags of sand I put in the cathedral are carefully placed and fit together exactly as they are.<br><br>Briefly, and my final word in this thread.<br><br><i>Levelling</i>: consider it as the <i>player</i> that levels up. Those that don't level still have that level available in the future. It is absolutely not like only rolling a 1 for Hit Points.<br><br><i>0 Kills</i>: the GM needs to grow balls and stick up for the aliens. If the PCs cause 0 kills then no Threat Tokens get removed.<br><br><i>Regeneration</i>: You killed them so you get the kills but now they're back.<br><br><i>E-vac</i>: only once per planet, highest rank only, need to succeed on NFA. Kiss all those potential kills goodbye. And the GM gets Isolate as an alien power if he wants it for a planet.<br><br>Do not plan ahead, just play the game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159765/#Comment_159765" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T08:33:55+00:00" title="July 30, 2008  8:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scary thread.

I haven't even read the rules myself yet, so for all I know they're clear as a bubbling spring of glacier water; and I'm very happy that you're answering questions here. But the mere fact that there's a 66-post-thread before the book has even been printed makes me go: "Whoa. I'm going to have to read all this unstructured stuff in this thread at some point, aren't I?

Totally fucked up.</blockquote>\nLet me clarify, you can do damage with a grenade at Close or Near, though much more at close (i.e. yes you can throw them, but it's not as good as stuffing them down their throats). What I meant was that anyone at close range when you chuck a grenade in there is close enough to get hit by them if they couldn't get out of the way (i.e. those who failed their roll). People standing by you at chucking range (if you throw from Near) are not hit, and neither are you unless you too are halfway down the throat of the aliens when the grenade goes off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159848/#Comment_159848" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T11:31:19+00:00" title="July 30, 2008 11:31AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian!

Sorry!\n<blockquote>Your question about grenades is answered on page 12 and again on page 81 in the weapons list. Grenades have kill values listed for Close and Near ranges.

That's my fault for trying to ask a question based on something I read the night before without actually having the text with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159866/#Comment_159866" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T12:10:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2008 12:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, everybody, can we leave this thread alone now?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Gregor                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7102/3-16-carnage-amongst-the-stars-rules-questions" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7102/3-16-carnage-amongst-the-stars-rules-questions" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7102/3-16-carnage-amongst-the-stars-rules-questions/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7102%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7102%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
