A lot of it was familiar to me, but I now have something I can pass on to others in one of my groups that can explain succinctly some things I've been trying to convey for years.  When I can afford it, I plan on getting a copy for several people.<br/><br/>The Status chapter, in particular, was useful to me.  Though I'd heard lectures on the subject from my improv instructors over the years, and read similar examples from Johnstone, I oddly hadn't thought much about it in the context of role-playing.  I also appreciate its relative brevity.  I anticipate scanning the section titles in preparation every time I GM.  It's so easy to "forget" lessons you've "learned" when they touch on uncomfortable techniques.<br/><br/>I'm not as quick with my improv skills now as I was in my twenties, (I put that down to diet Coke or something), but your book has re-invigorated my desire to take the lessons I've learned from improv and apply them to my games whether as a player or a GM.  I'm also going to try to make it to class more - it's amazing how rusty you can become in just a few weeks at things you thought you'd gotten down.  It's even more important for me because my opportunities to role-play don't come along as often as I'd like.<br/><br/>Thank you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114897/#Comment_114897" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T21:18:55+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  9:18PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been skimming my book back and forth myself, and will soon be able to post a review once I hit the "meaty" chapters.  Currently, I think it's great, like a Tao Te Ching of RPG tips for players and GMs, and I have mostly been skimming the back.  I will sit down this week/weekend and read it from the front!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114908/#Comment_114908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T23:50:50+00:00" title="December 17, 2007 11:50PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got the book. Read the book. LOVED the book!<br/><br/>Thanks Graham. I have but the briefest introduction to improv and your book gave me a bunch of useful stuff to help my games. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn the skills/tricks/mindset needed to run and play games with little to no prep ahead of time. It was like being reminded of things I had known all along, but just wasn't doing.<br/><br/>Silly Jarvis, games aren't for working, games are for playing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114913/#Comment_114913" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T00:52:30+00:00" title="December 18, 2007 12:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2007 12:53AM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks very much.
