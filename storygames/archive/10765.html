The goal of the game (which I named "Fat Chance!") is trying to be the fattest character of the group in order to earn something. All characters are in fact involved in some kind of challenge (players can decide anything about it before playing) that lets the fattest one win.<br/>\nThere is no GM: every gamer is both a player with authority over his/her own character, Scale and Hunger for the near other gamers. The role of Scale is to try and make other characters abandon the challenge, while the Hunger tries to convince them to keep gaining.<br/>\nEvery rule is created to make the players themselves feel more and more uncomfortable with their characters becoming fatter and fatter: the more they get fat, more dice have to be thrown in order to achieve a success, and the number range of success gets narrower.<br/>\nHunger and Scale create Embarrassing Scenes which have to be "won" in order to avoid being frustrated; when the frustration level gets too high, the character leaves the competition.<br/>\nI have yet to translate the whole game (since English is not my mother tongue), but if you feel interested into it I can do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior" title="14thWarrior"><img alt="14thWarrior" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.netflash.net/llanade/BHG_Avatar_Sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior">14thWarrior</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238731/#Comment_238731" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T09:04:59+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  9:04AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first question is what aspects of obesity are you trying to explore?

I don't want to trivialize a real situation: I know it's a difficult situation, since I'm living it with a dear person, and I'd like the game to inform others about how it feels being obese. It's kinda like the old "edutainment:" educating people while making them have some fun.

I ventured a little bit into the Fat Admirers' and Feederism world to have some informations on what a gaining life could look like, and that's how I managed to develop some parts of the game.<br/>Each character has five stats, some of which take care of their relationships and of their self-image; and each Embarrassing Scene should be a serious conflict between the will to win and the will to keep living a satisfying life. All of this with a "gamist" approach: as Hunger, you want to push your challenger's character limits in order to stress him/her, and as Scale you just want him/her to leave the competition in order to let your own character win it.<br/><br/>Michael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior" title="14thWarrior"><img alt="14thWarrior" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.netflash.net/llanade/BHG_Avatar_Sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior">14thWarrior</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238861/#Comment_238861" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T07:58:48+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  7:58AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some food for thought (pardon the pun) for this game, from a real life fat person...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor many, if not most obese people, the obesity stems from deeply rooted emotional issues.  Many have serious self esteem issues; some aren't unaware that their real problem is self esteem.  Most have been conditioned since childhood to associate food with pleasure and happiness.  So when they eat, it makes them happy for a short time; but they gain weight.  Their self esteem takes another hit; so they eat some more for the feeling of pleasure; and the cycle goes on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, the compulsion to satisfy the desire for pleasure or happiness is much, much stronger than the conscious knowledge that one should not eat so much.  For example, I once felt a compulsion to get something to eat that was so strong I went to the fridge, got some food, and ate it despite consciously and energetically telling myself that I was not hungry, and that I should not be succumbing to the compulsion.  It was like someone had implanted a mind control chip in my head and was controlling my actions via remote control; it was an almost surreal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost diets and so called healthy living plans, unfortunately, just don't address the real underlying causes of most peoples' obesity problem - that being the low self esteem and the association of food with pleasure and happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne system I found that did address those causes, and can be quite effective is Paul McKenna's "I Can Make You Thin" system.  It's a simple system that doesn't actually prescribe any particular foods, require one to change one's diet; rather, it provides a method to recognize the body's natural physiological signs of hunger and fullness, to recognize and suppress the purely emotional hunger signals, as well as to redirect the emotional associations of pleasure and happiness towards healthier activities such as exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps amongst all this rambling you might find some inspiration to ratchet up the meaningful exploration in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Tangherlini" title="Michael Tangherlini"><img alt="Michael Tangherlini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Tangherlini">Michael Tangherlini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239101/#Comment_239101" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T00:13:26+00:00" title="October 26, 2009 12:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 14thWarrior</cite>Their self esteem takes another hit; so they eat some more for the feeling of pleasure; and the cycle goes on and on.</blockquote>\nThat's the kind of cycle I'd like to replicate with my game!<br>So yes, your insight has been very meaningful to me, because I'm pretty sure it will help me adding some useful parts to the rules to let me create the feeling I want players to feel.<br>I'll be adding a quick primer on the rules very soon.<br><br>Michael                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Tangherlini" title="Michael Tangherlini"><img alt="Michael Tangherlini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Tangherlini">Michael Tangherlini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239196/#Comment_239196" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T13:53:04+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  1:53PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are the quick rules: <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/8iianrzfmy" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/shared/8iianrzfmy</a><br><br>-MikeT                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239205/#Comment_239205" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T14:52:19+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  2:52PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks like a good start.
