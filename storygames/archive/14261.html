No offense intended, I don't see how it's not included in any and all systems. Isn't that the point?"<br/><br/><a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2008/03/08/fictional-positioning-101/" rel="nofollow">The best discussion of the term so far is probably here.</a><br/><br/>So, I'd say, yes, it's included in any and all RPG systems, but to varying degree. Freeform would be almost entirely fictional positioning; Castle Ravenloft (the boardgame) is almost none; and Apocalypse World relies much more heavily on fictional positioning than D&amp;D 3 and 4e. <br/><br/>The way I see it, the tactical combat of TFT and D&amp;D 3 and 4 allow for little fictional positioning because there's this near 1:1 correspondence between the mechanics and the fiction. In these games, if you say, "I jump off the rafters and use the weight of my body to drive my spear in the cyclop's eye," the GM shrugs, consults the rules if they don't have it memorized, and says something like, "Okay, you get +2 because of your height advantage. Roll your attack and then move your mini one square and take 1d6 falling damage." And then you roll your attack and do average damage. "Is he blind?" you ask. The GM says, "No, nothing in the rules about targeting his eye. Guess you just hit him on the cheek."<br/>Compared to freeform or old-school, where the GM could say something like, "Awesome, you drive the spear through its eye into his brain and hang there - then the cyclops topples and lands on top of you." (a yes, but) or "Hmm, take a -4 penalty for aiming at the eye, but if you make it he'll take double damage and be blind." <br/><br/>For me, with TFT and D&amp;D3 and 4, the tactical combat is so detailed that almost anything I want to express in fiction has a mechanical rule. "I run up and flank the goblin" is not inert narration. So I like it! For what it is.<br/><br/>What if you used the D&amp;D4 skill system to handle combat, though?  Then "I flank the goblin" would be the same as "I hit the goblin" and "I trip the goblin" - make your roll and add 1 to your progress.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323613/#Comment_323613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T14:14:12+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  2:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see this most clearly when I think about, hmmm, fictional anti-positioning, or something:<br/><br/>- "I trip the snake!"<br/><br/>- "The gelatinous cube falls prone!"<br/><br/><br/>Etc, etc.  Not sure if there's already a good term for that or not.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323617/#Comment_323617" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T14:39:42+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  2:39PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, for it to be "fictional positioning" and not just colorful description, it has to actually matter: it has to be describing a choice (since you could be describing something else instead!) that changes the direction in which the narrative was going or, at least, future possibilities. <br/><br/>Getting a +1 modifier or whatever is one way it could matter, sure, but if you can just do that whenever you want -- with the GM rewarding you for describing placing your character in an advantage -- doesn't that incentivize "spamming" that interaction and doing it every single time? Walking into every bar with your gun at the ready and your back to the wall gets really dumb.  <br/><br/>But fictional positioning can also put yourself in position to do something else.  If you've established that the people in this town like you, maybe one of them will offer you a place to hide when your enemies come looking.  Honestly, I find that kind of positioning much more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323621/#Comment_323621" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:00:02+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:00PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny that this thread is kind of the mirror image of the "Parlour Narration" thread.<br/><br/>They're both about "how does what you say now affect your choices later on".<br/><br/>D&amp;D4E (skill challenges and combat), Contenders, and My Life With Master are all interesting games to talk about in this context, since I think they all come dangerously close to making what you say irrelevant to your future choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323622/#Comment_323622" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:00:15+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:00PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly. Fictional positioning is most important when it has a significant impact on questions like 'what could the PC do next?' or 'what sort of tools do these characters have at their disposal'. If I get my PC elected mayor of a city, that might not have any mechanical effect at all, but when a few minutes later I say 'I tell the chief of police to step up patrols and drug raids in Neighbourhood X, to destabilize my rival, the Crime Lord' -- that's just not something I could have reasonably done, prior to getting elected mayor. The fictional positioning changed the scope and the impact of my future actions, and probably did so in a way that the mechanics of the game don't really track.<br/><br/>The zoomed-in version of this is how, if I trip the guy with the crowbar, it is no longer reasonable for him to take a swing at my unarmoured head. It's not about +1 or -1, it's about what is possible at all within the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323625/#Comment_323625" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:08:20+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:08PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still not sure I understand what you're going for.  Is fictional positioning separate from "mechanical positioning"?  Saying Castle Ravenloft doesn't have any fictional positioning kind of implies that.  Does some fictional positioning also have mechanical effects, or is it only fictional if it only influences (primarily influences?) the fiction?  Or does some fictional positioning create mechanical affects? (or vice versa, where a mechanical success might let you narrate fictional positioning retroactively)<br/><br/>My gut would be that it's more about purely fictional positioning, like in Jon's second example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323642/#Comment_323642" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T17:05:56+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  5:05PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2011 5:06PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Cy">@Cy</a>: Fictional positioning means that you use the fiction to inform the mechanics. <br/>D&amp;D3e: If I get knocked prone by the Watcher in the Water in one round, I could fire my crossbow with a bonus on the next round. If I don't have a crossbow, I couldn't attack it at all, 'cause I'm too far away. <br/>If I'm facing off against some foes who don't speak at all, then anything my character says is going to be just so much colorful dialogue. If what I do in the fiction doesn't engage or inform the mechanics in any way, then it doesn't help to establish where I am/what's possible with the mechanics, and in turn it limits what the mechanics can do to change what I'm up to in the fiction. If I could, potentially, reason with the goblins, then what I say could very well matter, and quite a bit!<br/>I think the term literally comes from tactical combat where distances and cover and stuff matter - everything that happens in the plot (even stuff like "I charge across the field, dodging arrows, then duck behind the wagon!") is Fiction. Whenever we use an element of Fiction to determine advantage, disadvantage, triggering, etc., we have established Position. <br/>AW's Moves are 100% about fictional positioning. You can't just say "I seduce him. I roll +hot"- that doesn't trigger a Move. On the other hand, "I seduce him so he'll tell me where the Water Chip is", is totally fine - it firmly establishes that you are a) seducing or manipulating in order to b) get someone to give you something they wouldn't just hand over. Seduce Or Manipulate demands that you have both a) and b) before it can be triggered.<br/>It boils down to how we translate what we narrate in the game to what "counts", what everyone has to acknowledge as real and important.

The relevant rule in AW is 'to do it, do it' -- the only difference between your two examples is the second one added intent; it didn't actually describe what the character is doing in the fiction to achieve that intent, and an MC who is sticking to the principles of the game would probably ask the player 'how do you seduce them? what do you actually do?'.<br/><br/>But even if the second example did include that, I don't see how that connects to fictional positioning, except insofar as forcing the player to describe the character's action in the fiction helps make it obvious whether they should actually be able to attempt whatever it is they're doing, based on their prior position in the fiction. But 'fictional positioning' is not identical to 'make sure you narrate when you use a mechanic.'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323650/#Comment_323650" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T17:48:15+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  5:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Zac,<br/>     It makes sense, if everyone's on the same page.  I'd kind of assumed from the Parlour Narration thread that is was more about fictional weight of an action not having weight in the mechanics.<br/><br/>So, in a game like Anti-pool, where the fiction only minimally informs the mechanics (by determining which traits you can roll) there's very little fictional positioning?  And completely freeform roleplaying has no fictional positioning, because there's no mechanical impact?  To further clarify, this is only "before the action" sort of positioning too.  Not, say the fictional outcome of some mechanic.<br/><br/>I'm with John then, that these can really break down if they're not real choices/tradeoffs.  Making repetitive, uninteresting choices isn't good mechanics design.  Hiding them behind fictional positioning that we hope is cool doesn't make them better mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323652/#Comment_323652" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T18:05:51+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  6:05PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at Cy's post I'm thinking my post may have muddied things more than clarified them, since I spent so much time talking about tactical combat.<br/><br/>I'm not sure fictional positioning always necessarily informs the mechanics. Like with Jonathan's example. "The people in this town like me" might have been arbitrary backstory you made about your character. And then the enemies come looking, so you say "I hide at a friend's house." And the GM might say, "Sure, he takes you in and opens a trap door so you can hide under the floorboards." Without rolling a die or consulting a rule.<br/><br/><br/>Here's why fictional positioning is so cool to me - what I came to realize sometime in the last year. I used to believe, basically, "If you don't have a rule about it it doesn't matter." Like, you can say you have a helmet in 3e, but there's no mechanic for it. So I then say, "Who cares if I have a helmet or not? It's irrelevant. It's just color." And that means that a very comprehensive ruleset like Advanced Melee or D&amp;D3e is a good thing (even if they don't have rules for helmets) because it's more details for the fiction. <br/><br/>But now I believe that if I say "I have a helmet" it might matter, whether it's because I use it to take water from a stream to a fallen comrade or because the GM is specifically about to narrate some damage to my head and then doesn't because I have a helmet. Even if the chance of something like that coming up is one in a thousand. Just the fact that it might matter means I don't feel I've wasted my breath. And then we don't need such a comprehensive ruleset, because the play's in the fictional positioning.<br/><br/>Though it can lead to its own problems, like arguments about what we did or did not establish in the fiction, or arguments about what does or does not make sense given what we've established. "No, he's not going to hide you." "What? But they like me in this town." "Yeah, but not enough to hide you from imperial soldiers - they don't need that kind of heat."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323655/#Comment_323655" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T18:26:29+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  6:26PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">These comics are all about fictional positioning, right?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323663/#Comment_323663" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T18:51:54+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  6:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much.

He's giving it extra." In Ron's terms, positioning."<br/><br/>See how some of those things are on the character sheet, and some of them aren't?

It's very easy to quickly clutter the fiction with details that someone thinks might be useful some day, or to dis-incentivize stuff that makes for good/cool story if the fictional demands are hewn to too closely.  I find that a lot of 1-in-1000 odds are more likely to drag the story than the occasional time when they work out.  Especially if they end up with everyone wearing a helmet and, as Jon said, "walking into ever bar with their gun drawn and their back to the wall."  It can feel like making the thief say "I search for traps" every 5 feet is that's what their really doing.<br/><br/>I guess it's a question of how much details contribute overall, how much fictional positioning shuts down choices vs opening them up (and thus leading to uniformity) and how much they incentivize "spamming."<br/><br/>* - I know I'm mis-using the term, or it doesn't mean that in some form.

Move five feet. Check for traps. Move five feet."

If I don't have a crossbow, I couldn't attack it at all, 'cause I'm too far away.<br/><br/>AW's Moves are 100% about fictional positioning. You can't just say "I seduce him. I roll +hot"- that doesn't trigger a Move. On the other hand, "I seduce him so he'll tell me where the Water Chip is", is totally fine - it firmly establishes that you are a) seducing or manipulating in order to b) get someone to give you something they wouldn't just hand over. Seduce Or Manipulate demands that you have both a) and b) before it can be triggered.<br/>It boils down to how we translate what we narrate in the game to what "counts", what everyone has to acknowledge as real and important.</blockquote>\nExactly. However:\n<blockquote>I think the term literally comes from tactical combat where distances and cover and stuff matter - everything that happens in the plot (even stuff like "I charge across the field, dodging arrows, then duck behind the wagon!") is Fiction.</blockquote>\nThe term came from discussion of freeform, looking at the ways that you shore up your power in a situation where you either have little recourse to mechanics or where they don't matter to what you are dealing with. It's of course used in all games to differing degrees. I posted about it here at SG a while back and Vincent picked it up. I think I stuck in the fictional part in conversations in between somewhere. When he started running AW I yammered at him like what Zac said here about it so eloquently. <br/><br/>Going back a bit, positioning was discussed  and defined in Forge terms as statements about a character from outside a character's perspective (ie metagame). I coined fictional positioning to talk about what you do with those meta aspects of character to establish fictional currency and leverage to accomplish what you will. <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=114" rel="nofollow">Leverage</a> (in games as opposed to in tv) is used all the time in games, even when there are mechanics which are mostly used to give you effectiveness. The explicit fiction of having a sword underlies most fantasy combat. The implied fiction of being able to wield it  does too.  <br/><br/>Eero used leverage as a component of play in Solar System which is the only game I know of that does, though others must address it in one way or another. That implicity halo of the system that Zac or Jamie mention here. World and genre assumptions are way too much to write out in every book. We carry so much around in our heads.

How many times have you seen something like this happen:<br/><br/>GM: So, who's keeping watch during the night?<br/>PLAYERS: Uh, we were just going to go to sleep.<br/>GM: Well, okay...<br/>PLAYERS: Wait, wait, fuck. Uh, okay, I'll take the first watch, then Archirag, then Griften.<br/>GM: So, Griften has the watch just before dawn?<br/>PLAYER A: Yeah, but I'm keeping very alert. I've climbed a tree and I have my javelin out!<br/><br/>Pretty lame, right? The players are provoked into doing some fictional positioning that they don't care about, just so the GM won't screw them over by attacking them in the night in a way that's not fun and interesting but, in fact, will probably just suck and make them more likely to get killed (in a lame way) later on.<br/><br/>That said, fictional positioning is also critical to really basic things, like accomplishing anything there's not mechanics for.  Which, in both trad games and hippie games, is a whole hell of a lot. Even Burning Wheel, which has rules for a lot of things, notoriously lacks a swim skill because Luke hates the idea of rolling to see if you drown.  So if you're doing crap in the water, you're "just making it up," but hopefully in a way that's consistent and doesn't break anybody's suspension of disbelief.  And, if you get shot in the shoulder with an arrow, the GM is probably within their rights to say that you're having trouble keeping afloat and somebody's going to have to help you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323680/#Comment_323680" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T21:43:12+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  9:43PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't AW move usage\u2026 the same way most mechanics are used in most RPGs?<br/><br/>If Apocalypse World's Moves are 100% about fictional positioning because you can't just say "I roll Go Aggro" but instead you have to describe in the fiction what your character is doing that would trigger the "Go Aggro" move\u2026 isn't that what you do in most RPGs? <br/><br/>In a D&amp;D 4E skill challenge\u2026 I can't just say I roll my history skill.

Well, kinda. This is somewhat true of D&amp;D3E, but not so much true of 4E skill challenges.<br/><br/>With Apocalypse World, if you go aggro just by saying "I go aggro", a lot of the time the system just won't work. How do they give you something they think you want if you haven't told them? What are they supposed to suck up? How does the MC make the decision for the NPC if they don't know what the choices are?<br/><br/>In D&amp;D3E, if you're playing by the rules (which most people don't, because they're really difficult to remember), if you're intimidating someone, the rule is this:<br/><br/><i>You can change another\u2019s behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target\u2019s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target\u2019s Wisdom bonus [if any] + target\u2019s modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target\u2019s check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6\xd710 minutes afterward. After this time, the target\u2019s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile). <br/><br/>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.<br/><br/>You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent\u2019s resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target\u2019s modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you. </i><br/><br/>You make the roll, but you still have to act out the conversation with the NPC to get the benefit of your skill use.<br/><br/>In 4E, you can just roll the die and see if you succeeded. You're <i>supposed</i> to describe how you do that, but nothing <i>makes</i> you describe how you do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323684/#Comment_323684" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T22:33:14+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 10:33PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2011 10:55PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.  Tricky topic!  So, for measuring what a character can do, the Forge glossary distinguishes between Effectiveness, Resource, and Positioning.<br/><br/>Let's say I want favors from the nobility in my Burning Wheel game.  Right now, my character's in the position of not knowing any nobles.  So, I make a Circles test to find a friendly noble.  I succeed.  The test established stakes for my roll, and the success got me those stakes.  I now know a friendly noble!  I am now in much better position to get the favors I ultimately want.<br/><br/>So, what do we call that?  Effectiveness, Resource, or Positioning?<br/><br/>When Positioning is completely measured mechanically ("I have +1 to get a favor, but only because I paid for the Noble of +1 to Get a Favor"), does it become Effectiveness?<br/><br/>I suspect it does.  Accordingly, I'm inclined to use the term "Positioning" only for situations where fictional positioning gives a character options directly, without mechanical mediation.

Or maybe it's a design flaw? <br/><br/>In the case of AW, I think the goal is to give you a little time to decide what angle you want to go with, while you work out what your character's Moves can accomplish and which of your stats are the most useful. It seems like a real min-maxer would stick with his highest stats and use those Moves all the time, so the only reason to go suboptimal is if you're not sure what direction to go with the character yet.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Is the fiction informing the mechanics or are we positioning the fiction to match a benefit the mechanics give us?</blockquote> I think this is intentional in Apocalypse World - it helps to make Gunluggers and Hardholders aggressive, Drivers brave, and Skinners tricky. Brainers and Angels are good at finding things out. It's kind of like programming, you know? It doesn't guarantee a character's personality at all, as straight-up violence doesn't always invoke a Move, and some Moves let you get away with swapping stats around (the Angel's Sixth Sense lets you use Sharp to "open your brain..." instead of Weird; Gunluggers and Drivers have a similar Move).<br/>It seems like Hardholders and Choppers, having more social/fiction-based power than other classes, have also been deprived of stat-swap Moves. This would probably give such characters a shared feel and outlook, to an extent. <br/><br/>My Operator has lots of natural Cool, so I could engage with taking risks in the fiction, but one of the stat sets rates you at +2Sharp as well. Up until she got her samurai sword, she was an intense, standoffish, observant character. Once she got the sword, she was much more driven, and her observant nature kind of shifted into being a look-first warrior, rather than someone more pacific. Her choices ended up becoming more about "Do I see the risk before I attack?" and less about "What's going on here?" <br/>The concept of highlighting stats for experience is a bit weak - the only sharp limit on true min/maxing is believability of characterization. The GM is there to help enforce that a bit, with principles like "To do it, do it", but there is an element of false choice with highlighting stats - the different basic Moves will be noticeably easier or harder than one another because of their respective ratings. <br/>I'm not sure what the solution is, here - it'd be lame if you could only get XP for your playbook's "favorite" stat. <br/>I do think that, as long as you follow the principles, specifically "To do it, do it" (to enforce fictional positioning) and "Ask provocative questions and build on the answers" (to give appropriate consequences for spamming the Move in question).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323688/#Comment_323688" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T22:58:36+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 10:58PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Full disclosure: "does it become Effectiveness?" in my post above used to read "does it become Resource?"  <br/><br/>Zac corrected me and I changed it so my error wouldn't distract from the point I was trying to make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323689/#Comment_323689" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T23:04:11+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 11:04PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2011 11:05PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>It's true that in D&amp;D often you look at your highest skill and then try to justify its use but I see the same thing happen in Apocalypse World.

Fascinating!<br/><br/>Going back on what I said earlier, I think it's less a "design flaw" than simply a different aesthetic priority. Buddha, from my Virginia gaming group, dislikes Ghost/Echo somewhat because, for him, thinking up goals and dangers pulls him right out of the fiction. Me, I'm dying to imagine the possible twists and turns the story could take! It's a combination of preferred Stance and preferred (or most preferred) Creative Agenda. <br/><br/>I like metagaming, specifically thinking a bit *about* the story as an object separate from my immersion in it. If that's what's going on for John, then the issue is about preference - D&amp;D4 and AW support Step On Up and Story Now play, respectively, but they have very different degrees of fictional positioning in their mechanics. One explicitly metagames tactics - mastering the rules is part of Step On Up play - and the other takes a totally different approach: forcing any and all power-gaming to be comfortably placed inside the fiction, easing the process with character niches and a highly flexible reward cycle. <br/>These things don't necessarily work with Right to Dream play - it IS more important that cues derive from the fiction, and the reward cycle might be purposed towards simply maximizing the amount of fiction a player can encounter (since the goal is Exploration itself).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323704/#Comment_323704" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T00:37:50+00:00" title="May 10, 2011 12:37AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is part of why I asked about definitions.<br/><br/>Jamie, I'd say Archipelago (as an example) doesn't have much where the fiction drives the mechanics.  Directly at least, I suppose it's still driven by the other player's opinions of the fiction.  It definitely has a lot of fiction driving what's logical in the fiction.  So if fictional positioning is how fiction drives mechanics, it sounds like it's not that important in Archipelago.  But if it means setting up fiction to drive fiction in the future, then it's everywhere.<br/><br/>Jon, it seems like if fictional positioning isn't about how fiction drives mechanics, then it wouldn't be involved at all for situations where you don't have mechanics.  Is there some separate term for fiction which drives future fiction vs fiction which drives future mechanics?

Fictional positioning is rightward-pointing arrows. Sometimes they go all the way to dice, but sometimes they only need to go to the smiley faces, because the moments of judgement are enough (or we don't even actually have rules for it anyway).<br/><br/>Archipelago, as a system, has a lot of leftward-pointing arrows. I don't think it has a single rightward-pointing arrow as far as the system is written (maybe with fates, I don't remember). However, in play, it mostly consists of rightward-pointing arrows. The system kicks in when that's not sufficient and lets the players edit the fiction through that.<br/><br/>Cy is right, it's not <i>necessarily</i> about fiction impacting mechanics because freeform doesn't have mechanics and is all fictional positioning. It's about fiction having a role, it matters. If you take away rightward-pointing arrows you are left with only dice-to-dice arrows which means you've got a boardgame or leftward-pointing arrows without feedback, which means you've got a fiction...crafting game? Something like an exquisite corpse for example.<br/><br/>[[[So all RPGs (or story games) have fictional positioning, on a big scale, if nothing else. <br/>-"You're on a boat."<br/>-"I go buy fresh bread from the baker."<br/>-"Huh?"<br/><br/>I think where it varies the most is fictional positioning "at the micro". For example in combat D&amp;D4 has almost zero fictional positioning at the micro by default, because all positioning is governed by the battlemat and various powers, it's all leftward-pointing arrows. But there's almost certainly still some fictional positioning in there. If I'm facing a pair of kobolds and the evil guy who killed my hero's mentor, I'm probably going after the evil guy, right? Because it's what I (fictionally) care about, it's how I'm positioned in the fiction.]]]<br/><br/>Fiction impacting the mechanics (cloud-to-dice) is just the easiest way to think about it. <br/>"If your character has the high ground, get a +2 to your roll." - me jumping on the table and now being higher than the orc is all fictional, but I got a +2, so it matters.<br/>But it can be non mechanical (cloud-to-smiley-faces-to-cloud).<br/>"I look through the keyhole." "You see the queen and her lover!" "Now I have something to blackmail her with." All fictional, but it matters, because now the story is in another place, direction, you've got a new resource, a different position, relationships have changed. Very structuralist actually.<br/><br/>(If you have no idea what I'm talking about with the clouds and dice I can start at the beginning.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323727/#Comment_323727" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T07:02:25+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  7:02AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Isn't AW move usage\u2026 the same way most mechanics are used in most RPGs?</blockquote>\nYes! Well, kinda. This is somewhat true of D&amp;D3E, but not so much true of 4E skill challenges.<br/><br/>With Apocalypse World, if you go aggro just by saying "I go aggro", a lot of the time the system just won't work. How do they give you something they think you want if you haven't told them? What are they supposed to suck up? How does the MC make the decision for the NPC if they don't know what the choices are?<br/><br/>In D&amp;D3E, if you're playing by the rules (which most people don't, because they're really difficult to remember), if you're intimidating someone, the rule is this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>In 4E, you can just roll the die and see if you succeeded. You're<i>supposes</i>to describe how you do that, but nothing<i>makes</i>you describe how you do that.</blockquote>\nIn D&amp;D 4E, by the rules and the various DM advice in DMG 1 &amp; 2, you can't just roll and see if you succeed without describing how you are trying to accomplish your goals in the fiction. You have to describe first. This is reinforced because the DM can declare the attempt an automatic success or failure just based on the description before you roll. Additionally, the DM can alter your chances of success if you have some sort of fictional advantage before making the roll (this is true in D&amp;D 3E as well via circumstance bonuses). Now granted, I don't think everyone plays this way. And I don't think most people use most of D&amp;D's rules. I think the problem is that most of these rules and guidelines are in the DMG, not the Players Handbook.<br/><br/>But many people I've spoken to (or observed) also don't play Apocalypse World by the rules, often unintentionally. They forget to roll Harm. Use Manipulate without leverage. Roll Seize by Force when it should have been Go Aggro. <br/><br/>I think reasons you see players in D&amp;D focus on which mechanical skills they want to use over focusing on what's going on in the fiction: <br/><br/>- skills are hyper focused<br/>- characters are only good at few skills<br/>- the difference between the skills you are good at and the skills you are bad at is huge<br/>- the game system is setup so that you will mostly fail at the skills you aren't specialized at<br/>- mechanically there is no reason to step outside your tight niche <br/>- failure isn't rewarding, fun, or interesting (skill challenges try to change this)<br/>- DMs often forget to give circumstance bonuses for descriptions<br/><br/>So the result is you spam a tiny list of skills and retrofit the fiction as best you can to justify the use of these skills. <br/><br/>Talking to many old school gamers, they feel that the introduction of skills to D&amp;D killed fictional positioning. In OD&amp;D, description is everything! Your choices were often: 1. Roll 2. Run away 3. Convince the DM via positioning the fiction that you don't have to roll to overcome an obstacle. "I use a long stick to try to trigger any traps without having to enter the room." This was why equipment was so important back then. You needed leverage to position the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323742/#Comment_323742" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T09:40:46+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  9:40AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2011 9:43AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, my post getting eaten means I can pare it down even further!<br/>So Vincent shared a <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=497" rel="nofollow">link</a> and claimed that comment <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2318&amp;Mode=like">#18</a> was really important. I think that's true, but before you can make sense of it, I recommend looking at comment #34: \n<blockquote><b>Josh W says,</b> <br/>I really dislike "currency" as a term, but my version is really long: "rules embodied intra-character causality"!</blockquote>\nCurrency is a matter of how a character's fiction and mechanics influence themselves and each other, and are influenced by the overall fiction.<br/>We can easily recall some ways in which this happens - think of a D&amp;D3e game where the GM just isn't throwing out a lot of monsters for y'all to fight. How the hell are you supposed to level up?? Doing particular things in the fiction, like killin' a dude in a fight, not only risks our HP and invokes our equipment; it also makes us better at killin' dudes in fights. It's a feedback loop. So that's fiction --&gt; mechanics --&gt; fiction. <br/><br/>D&amp;D character class is a mechanical choice that comes with its own fiction --&gt; fiction effects: if you roll up a Paladin, and I roll up an Assassin, then whether or not we argue and get in each other's way, we're still thinking about how we could do so if we wanted to, how it would make sense, and not doing so must be significant somehow. It creates a tension. Hell, even if we totally ignore the alignment rules, we're still aware of that thing called a Paladin and what's expected of it as a trope, so play is influenced. Same with Hx statements in AW - they set up fictional relationships that you can embrace or ignore at your leisure, but the important thing is that you made a choice and you know you did. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that we're positioning ourselves all the time, but it doesn't just come from the actions we take or the things we say. Some things that are just side effects of mechanical choices/effects can totally change the tone or tenor of play. <br/>Example: in Polaris, once you run out of Zeal and gain Weariness, your character can die at any time if you say so. This is a purely fiction-level shift in capabilities. Even if you don't even say anything about it, everyone who knows you're now Weary instead of Zealous knows that you can punch your card whenever you like, so maybe they get antsy about your character dying, or maybe your Mistaken decides it's time to up the ante and see what you're willing to live through. <br/><br/>Just opening up a new fictional possibility can be enough to influence how we play, what choices we make, etc. I think that's pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323766/#Comment_323766" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T11:56:02+00:00" title="May 10, 2011 11:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/16Cq_q6Nj1Rj5CUthV03o0skFFGsRzPTNta8dBob9wv0/edit?hl=en" rel="nofollow">So now I'm imagining this venn diagram.</a><br/><br/>Look right?<br/><br/>(One could argue those mechanical-positions on the left have fictional corollaries, like "I have 2 plot points" means "I'm favored by the Gods" but I imagine them as being more about player position ("I have narrative authority") than character position.)<br/><br/>And we could talk about games in terms of the size of their 'mechanical positioning' bubble.

At first glance it's obviously Positioning - it determines my place in the world. But at times it also behaves like a Resource - it can get lowered to represent harm (undead level drain) and I may deplete it to acheive something (spending XP to craft magic items).<br/>Or Abilities for example - Strength is Effectiveness, but then I get hit by a Ray of Enfeeblement and it gets depleted like a resource.[...]many of the numbers on my game's character sheet could be either. Maybe I'm confused regarding the definitions or is this a normal thing that happens?</blockquote>\nTo which Vincent replied\n<blockquote>That's precisely currency in action! Trade positioning for resources, bank effectiveness toward better positioning, burn resources to spike effectiveness, suffer lost resources or positioning when your effectiveness fails - all very common. It's a game's currency rules that create those active relationships, the details of the trading, burning, banking, suffering and so on.</blockquote>\nAnd Ron expanded:\n<blockquote>A key feature of the Currency concept is that a given game item is perfectly capable of being more than one of Effectiveness, Positioning, and/or Resources. I am emphatically not recommending that a game designer parse out every little detail on the sheet into one and only one of them.<br/><br/>Some related points.<br/><br/>1. Character sheets from different games aren't as immediately comparable as they might seem. "Native land: Perspicania," on one sheet might tie directly into attribute scores that are primarily about Effectiveness. And in some other game the equivalent notation might be specifically about Positioning, whether political or psychological.  And in Hero Wars (now HeroQuest), the equivalent notation provides so much framing information that tons of Effectiveness and Positioning details are set into place, or option-sets are set into place, by that notation.<br/><br/>2. I also want to articulate a subtler point about Currency which I think may be getting lost in this thread. Currency exchange may occur within a given character component category, i.e., within different kinds of Effectiveness; as well as among those categories, e.g., between Effectiveness and Resources.<br/><br/>3. And finally, to reference the older Color-First threads yet again, one of my main points there was that game design itself as well as character creation were acts of "setting the starting game board" for Currency. I wanted to investigate the diversity between fixing this setup prior to player choices vs. due to player choices, and to see whether apparent player choice was illustory in some games. Another was that many games left a crucial step of that process in a sort of limbo between prep and play, and I wanted to see which were productive limbos and which weren't.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323927/#Comment_323927" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T12:23:41+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 12:23PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 12:29PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, I'm not experiencing any confusion about currency at the moment.

Speaking the same language is useful for communicating with other designers, yes.  But if a dozen people in this thread have different ideas about what a word means, then its time to define that thing unequivocally, otherwise its just making things harder.    I think that if you <i>cant </i>explain something simply in a <i>relatively </i>short space, then you don't really have a handle on it yourself.  <br/><br/>I find 'why' is really good for this.  Explain to someone why they need to understand a thing, and their brains (and possibly yours as well) will leap intuitively to an understanding of what the thing is and then start extrapolating like crazy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323982/#Comment_323982" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T17:15:33+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  5:15PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I think that if you<i>cant</i>explain something simply in a<i>relatively</i>short space, then you don't really have a handle on it yourself.</blockquote>\nOh god, here we go, it's Jargon Thread Redux v828.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323984/#Comment_323984" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T17:31:15+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  5:31PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 5:36PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I think that if you<i>cant</i>explain something simply in a<i>relatively</i>short space, then you don't really have a handle on it yourself.</blockquote>\nOh god, here we go, it's Jargon Thread Redux v828.<br/><br/>Is there a link for that, I couldnt find it?<br/><br/>edit: Im new here so humor me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
