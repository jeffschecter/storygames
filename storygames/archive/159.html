                    This is riffing off of Brand's post here:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=156" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=156</a><br/><br/>Brand started a really good example: He's talking about what he can do, as a gamer and GM/whatever, how he can tap into those storytelling techniques of old, and bring them into the gaming table. Awesome.<br/><br/>This thread is for folks who are writing or thinking about writing games that have things like:<br/>Protagonist decentralization<br/>Shared protagonists/antagonists<br/>No GM, rather shared responsibilities<br/>Other "Aimed at Storytelling" techniques<br/><br/>What are you going to do to ensure that people, new players and old-school gamers alike, <i>get</i> your game? <br/><br/>So that new users can immediately pick it up and understand what they're supposed to do with it.<br/><br/>So that gamers of all hats can look at it without making assumptions about how it's played, so they don't use it to run trad Dungeon Crawls?<br/><br/>It is my assumption that it's critical to use examples, accentuated through rule-book layout and the like.<br/><br/>So, Your New Game is in your hands, picture it in your mind's eye.  The reader (new gamer, and old hat gamer) starts thumbing through it, perhaps having just purchased it. Editing, layout, and art is all paid for; money was no object.<br/><br/>What did you do to get new players to understand what the game was about? <br/><br/>What did you do to get old-hat players to understand that the game isn't meant to be run like they're used to?<br/><br/>I'm assuming here that someone isn't taking the "Fuck newbies!" or "Fuck gamers!" approach, and that you want your audience to contain both of the above.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            I've been writing on a "storytelling" game that, while it doesn't have co-ownership (only to the extent that conflicts can result in me changing your character), it doesn't have a GM, and it works with things like conflict webs and driving passions and shit.<br/>
<br/>
The introduction has a section called "Your Roots" with different sections for people with different gaming experiences; there's "newbie", "old school RPer", "freeform RPer", and "collaborative writer" at this point. That'll give people an insight from how the game works specifically with regards to their previous experience.                        </div>

<p>My take on traditional games is that it's just what it's called:  Tradition.</p>
<p>Hum a few bars from "Fiddler on the Roof" here.  It'll get you on the same mental page with me.</p>
<p>Tradition helps people orient on what they find important.  It is, itself, important.  Even when the traditions are <em>ridiculous</em>, they become important because they are traditional.</p>
<p>Innovation and tradition aren't <em>inherent</em> enemies.  But they don't go together without some serious thought.</p>
<p>In Capes I threw tradition to the winds.  "Who needs it!", said I.  Well, turns out, Capes is sorta hard for people to grok.  Oh, the utter surprise of it all.  Oy.</p>
<p>For Misery Bubblegum, I'm going to be making a conscious effort to understand the role of our sub-culture's traditions, and to find a way to innovate without discarding them.</p>
<p>So that's pretty abstract.  But that's where my thinking is right now.</p>

                            For me, I'm working on 1000 Stories with Mo. <br/><br/>In 1000 Stories, if we do it right, it will be literally impossible to create a character who is not caught up in the middle of a conflict that is about to fundementally alter their life. Something is going to change, or something is going to snap, and once the ball starts rolling there is nothing you can do to stop it. <br/><br/>It's also fundementally "real world gaming" and all about real people in the kind of real situations we all know about from life, literature, and movies -- so there isn't anything to hide behind except your own humanity. <br/><br/>Finally, the mechanics of the game fully divorce "can my character succede at this thing" to "what can I say with this character" in a way that focuses around you being able to do anything you want with your character -- anything at all -- except the things that really matter. That you have to work for, and push for, and pull for, and get everyone else onboard for.  No group buy in = you suck. So thank you Czege principle and co-ownership.  <br/><br/>So far the responses from our pre-playtesters have been along the lines of "awesome, but its really like a theatre game and not an RPG" and "Oh that's what you meant when you told me to create characters with conflict" -- so hopefully we're on the right track.                        </div>

                            With Dramatikos, the main thing I'm doing is writing it as a game, not a roleplaying game.  In fact, I think the only time I mention the word roleplaying is for one of the example players.  Of course Dramatikos is a roleplaying game, but I found that once I divorced myself from the baggage associated with what goes into a roleplaying game, I could just write Dramatikos as a game and still get the important point across.  I deliberately omit the "what is roleplaying" part.  I treat my game as its own entity, not as something that falls under the umbrella of roleplaying games.  It's not without precedent.  Monopoly doesn't explain "what a board game is."  Uno doesn't go talking about "what is a card game."  They only describe the game that the players have in their hands.  By doing this, I have found that I am forced to express the spirit and rules of the game more clearly because I cannot assume that the players are at all familiar with roleplaying games.  I cannot lean on presumptions about how roleplaying games are or should be played.  All I can do is describe what Dramatikos is and how to play it.  I certainly allude to the various RPG formats, but I don't go into detail.  I leave it to the players to discover the best venue for their games of Dramatikos.  That, I think, is the hard part: not trying to play the game for the players through the text.                        </div>

                            In the Roach, I tried to approach the actual rules from a sort of neutral point of view.  I actually think non-gamers will pick it up and play it as easily and effectively as gamers will, so I tried to address the potential confusion either group might find with a game that has no GM and few rules about how to build conflicts.  It's surprisingly hard to balance and I'm not sure I entirely succeeded.  A lot has to do with clarity and focus.  <br/><br/>There are points where I stop and say, "to be perfectly clear:" followed by something important in italics like "you don't do any tricks with your dice" or "you cannot win the game if you end in this condition".  <br/><br/>I included a lot of examples of actual play that build on one another and are, hopefully, fun to read and evocative of the kind of play I want to see.  The game is also stuffed with artwork that, I think, supports the mood I'm going for and is itself lots of fun.  <br/><br/>I included little "nota bene" paragraphs where I give advice or suggestions on how to make the game really fun.<br/><br/>Can you tell I'm stoked?  I just got my proof from RPI.                        </div>

                            In developing my Ronnies entry <i>Today</i>, I'm including two types of examples--one showing what the players are doing with the dice and decisionmaking and the other focusing on what the characters are doing in the SIS as a result. My early drafts did not separate the two, but clarity for newbies and traditional gamers seems better served by separating them. I also plan on having an extended example of play at the end to bring both components together, like in the CoC rulebook and other old school games, though hopefully more illustrative of what play can be like. <br/><br/>Like Green, I don't have a section explaining RPGs generally, although I hadn't fully thought through why I don't have one yet.<br/><br/>Brand, 1000 Stories sounds really cool and seems to share some theme with <i>Today</i>. Maybe real life gaming will be the next big thing, we can hope, right?                        </div>

                            I like a lot of what I see here: Rewriting play from the ground up, not putting in "What is Roleplaying?" sections, just rather treating it like "any ohter game with special rules", etc.<br/><br/>For me... well, admittedly my first project (the Ghost Killers) is aimed directly at gamers, with a nod to new roleplayers.  So while I'll put a lot of emphasis on making it understandable to the newbie, I'm still levelling a lot at the player.<br/><br/>One thing I'm thinking of is putting in "Concept" sections which let the reader know (ala writing from DITV) why the rules were made as such, what they're supposed to do, etc.  I also see sidebars with words like "STOP!!!" when it comes to material that the gamemaster usually hides and makes his own (in this game, there is still a GM, but the players define the background of the game from five areas).<br/><br/>If I go the route of writing a really story-oriented game where it's absolutely seeped in situation, I'd have to back up, put in plenty of play examples, and work in at least three play example paragraphs per rule to get folks on the same page without, say, making them come to my personal forum,etc.<br/><br/>Lots of food for thought. Thanks, guys.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            A lot of it comes with your situation generator. In Dogs, it's Town Creation. In Shock: it's the Grid. It's the reason the characters are there.<br/>
<br/>
In Dogs, it's their job to be there, confronting stuff. In PTA, it's the characters' Issues and Story Arc. In Shock: it's whatever's at your crux.<br/>
<br/>
Make a system where the characters are protagonists and it will be unavoidable.<br/>
<br/>
Put a Wizard, a couple of Hobbits, a Dwarf, an Elf, and a a couple of Men in a dungeon, trying to get through it to Save the World and maybe find some treasure along the way. <br/>
<br/>
That's pretty boring unless you know that the Wizard is going to face his doom, the Hobbits are going to make it happen, the Dwarf is mourning for his lost home, the Elf distrusts the Dwarf, and the Men both want to rule the world and might kill the Hobbits to do it. Now that dungeon crawl is pretty gnarly. If I were to write it, I'd make the Dwarf mistrust the Wizard and the Wizard distrust both men. And while we're at it, have the Elf covet the Wizard's power.                        </div>

                            Preach on, preacher!  Interesting to me is that the "situation generator" can also be pretty static - the Roach works really well on a very rigid framework - six defined events in sequence, with three NPCs who must appear in each from a revolving cast of nine.  That's all there is, and no two games are ever the same, ever.  I think you could get rid of the mandatory NPCs and it'd be fine, too.                        </div>

                            Jason, while I haven't actually seen the rules or played the game myself, from what I <em>hear</em>, it sounds like the Roach rules are themselves a situation creation and development system.  Players are allowed to and rewarded for introducing new characters, relating those characters together, and then manipulating those relationships.  The beauty is that you do this <em>in game</em> rather than as "prep".                        </div>

                            Setting aside the competitive imperative to swallow insects ("The Morningstar Principle?"), I wanted to get back to Jason's bit about The Roach:<br/>
<br/>
'Players are allowed to and rewarded for introducing new characters, relating those characters together, and then manipulating those relationships. The beauty is that you do this in game rather than as "prep".'<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a general principle worth following. Or:<br/>
<br/>
"CHARGEN" IS THE ENEMY OF STORY.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. In what novel, what movie, what folktale, what "so this guy walked into a bar..." anecdote, does the audience see any of the main characters described in elaborate detail before the story starts? (Okay, maybe stories about well-known franchised characters -- but how often are those any good?). In most other art forms, characters are "generated" during the story, scene by scene, as they actually  interesting things that show you who they are, and how they're changing.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas the habit of putting together a complete character before the story/gameplay starts makes it very easy to create characters that can't change, can't connect to each other, and don't have a stake in the situation. Plus it requires everyone to learn the rules before play, or get handheld through chargen by someone who does, which is a really high up-front investment to ask of non-geeks.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, sonsciously creating  characters and throwing them into action, and finding out what they're about as they act, react, and interact, seems much more fertile to me -- and it's the way most of the movies, books, comics, plays that I like handle their "chargen."<br/>
<br/>
Self-servingness / specific example time: My own November Ronnies entry, "apocalypse girl," tries this approach with "chargen" that consists of "write down one sentence or phrase that interests you, that's your Core, now start play!" And as I'm (sloooowly) revising it, I'm trying to work specific literary tricks for developing character into the turn structure: if you skip your turn in order to take a double turn later, for example, you have to narrate foreshadowing; if you use your turn to recharge a character's dice pools, you have to narrate some character development, something the other players didn't know before about that person; and all conflict is about characters trying to change each other -- the system simply doesn't make allowance for any other kind of stakes in conflict.                        </div>

                            Ok, I sort of agree and disagree with Sydney.<br/>
<br/>
I _entirely_ agree that the character with the novel of background before play begins is a big roadblock.  It's generally more information than anyone else wants to buy into (since it was developed in isolation)  and it is can be the hallmark of a character whose story has already been told.  Uninteresting and ultimately frustrating for both the player and the GM.<br/>
<br/>
Where I disagree is that I think there are a number of ways to do chargen, even very involved chargen, which also satisfy the needs of having characters who are hooked into the game and the other characters.<br/>
<br/>
My own bias towards Fate notwithstanding, games that really emphasize how the character is connected to the game and to other players during character generation have a lot of miles.  Anything which can be made into a solid relationship map can really get things going, and games that have that idea in a really central place (notably Polaris and Gannakagok) provide a really potent return on the investment.<br/>
<br/>
So, that said, I have a lot of love for development in play - it's fast and fun and it should absolutely be a club in every gamer's bag.  But it's not flawless, and I wouldn't get rid of those other clubs yet.<br/>
<br/>
So, bottom line - I heartily embrace the principal of making sure chargen produces characters that are ready to _play_, whatever that takes.  I just qualify it by noting that there are a hell of a lot of ways to skin that particular cat.<br/>

                            Oh, Life Paths rock. I love them. And I've made tons of characters with various life path systems, and actually played -- uh -- hmmm -- none of them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm an extreme case. But nevertheless the fun of crunchy chargen, with or without lifepaths, is a different kind of fun ("lonely fun") from that of actual play, and the one doesn't necessarily prepare for or lead into the other...<br/>
<br/>
...unless you deliberately and consciously design your chargen system to tie into situation, relationship maps, etc. -- which I think is what Rob and "Semipiternity" are advocating. (Have I got you right, guys?) My personal guess is collaborative character, situation, and even setting design by the group as a whole -- as modeled by  and  in very different ways -- is probably the best bet to achieve this.<br/>
<br/>
In other words: crunchy preparation activities are at best irrelevant to, and at worst inimical to, actual play UNLESS the whole group does them together, in which case they start blurring into actual play.                        </div>

                            Heh.  Fun chargen does tend to go hand in hand with problematic chargen.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, making Champions character is fun.  Heck, almost any supers system makes it fun to make characters.  The problem is that it s fun to do by yourself, and you show up at the game with a finished character for the GM to approve of.  The character might be awesome, but it's not hooked into the group.<br/>
<br/>
So I will say that the real winner for chargen is to have everyone do it together, be it in play or beforehand.  Even for games with no formal collaborative element to chargen (like D&amp;D) the difference that is made by everyone sitting down and talking about what they're doing and hooking into each other cannot be overstated.<br/>
<br/>
And hell, if that fails, there are still dirty tricks.  Things like "Look at the guy on your left.  He saved your life.  You guys work it out." add a couple minutes to any kind of chargen but the return on it is usually quite awesome.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah. We're playing together, we should sure as hell create together.<br/>
