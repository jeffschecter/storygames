The audience put more and more pressure on the trick shooter to make the shot harder by increasing the distance and to not get hit by his Vice for pleasing crowds he agrees and the difficulty is up to 40. He makes an excellent shot but still has to push 22 which he divides between Sweat and Tears and when the apple halves hit the ground he rushes to embrace the boy and weep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239442/#Comment_239442" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T09:59:01+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  9:59AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are pretty awesome.

The Buddy Score is actually a pretty important thing. It gives you a bonus when acting to aid your buddy (anyone that you have a +1 or better Buddy Score with), but it also is important to advancement. When you gain an experience level, you have these options:<br/>1. Gain proficiency in a selected weapon or armor type<br/>2. Change a +1 trait to +2.<br/>3. Gain a trait from a buddy's Employee Handbook.<br/>4. Gain a skill from a buddy's Employee Handbook.<br/><br/>This simulates the idea that, once you make friends with your coworkers, you start learning from each other and showing each other tricks. To complicate this currency, certain classes are more limited in their starting friendships (such as Crashers and Gloomdolls are the worst in this regard), or have a hard time making friendships in the first place (ex. Hardcases and Maddogs)<br/><br/>I considered bicycle in addition to rollerblades and skateboard, but I decided it would be too difficult to use in tight spaces (like dungeon corridors), and that picking the bicycle would thus, many times, rip out half of your niche -- the Crasher's niche being a.) mobility in action sequences, and b.) coping with damage. Only one other class ignores damage better, and the Crasher is the <i>only</i> class that becomes more dangerous when damaged.<br/><br/>The Crasher is, as I see it, a punk kid. But, when you take into account his ability to deal with being damaged, he's still just as badass as the other killer/muscle classes (except maybe the Hardcase, who will be in the next batch.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239472/#Comment_239472" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T11:46:24+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 11:46AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas,<br/>I want to clarify and say that the Crasher isn't set in stone already.

I was thinking segways, maybe? That would be HORRIBLE in the most awesome of ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, maybe some combination of a surfboard and explosions?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd bikes make sense to me, actually... I'm picturing the guy never getting off of one, ramming through doors, crashing into faces, throwing it into the thick of enemies and then having the gas tank explode, stuff like that. As for reduced mobility in closed spaces - you saw those youtube vidues with parkour guys running on walls, being all parallel to the ground and such? Imagine that, only with a bike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, just so there is no confusion: what you're doing is unbelievably cool. It's like you took dungeoncrawling and chopped everything away except for its beating heart.

It's not easy avoiding all that blood, you know, but you gotta manage if you want to look good, and he does. Has a longsword and a straight razor (giving him two of either just seems weird for some reason).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile playing a Carver, I'd like to get to be able to cut the enemies' major blood vessels of my choice. You know, really mess 'em up. "Find the weak point" would be pretty much what I had in mind, but I guess I care more about doing more damage to exposed flesh than being able to ignore armor better. Maybe that's already what that means? I'm not fully sure what "armor" really means in MADCorp, I guess (due to mention of blades having some sort of effect on armour, mostly). But I wouldn't have even thought about this if you haven't asked about it specifically.

Change the wording of "deathwish attack," "inadvisable stunt," and "Roller 4 life" to talk about <i>wheels</i> instead of just rollerblades and skateboards. Also to explicitly mention that you can run on walls (which was always intended, but I just realized I wasn't explicit about it).<br><br>However, I'm thinking that the motorized stuff wouldn't be available as starting equipment: you'd have to buy it. Or have a Gearhead build it.<br><br>Concerning major blood vessels of choice:<br>When you roll edged weapon damage, the following results are possible: Minor, Grievous, Severe, Dead, Crippling, Mangling, Amputation. These are on a chart with weighted probabilities (f'rinstance, Minor is 25% of the time, while Dead is only 5%). Whatever you end up with, you can totally describe it however you want to.<br><br>Armor penalizes damage rolls. Normally on a damage roll, you roll one die and compare it to the appropriate damage table, and that's what you get. If you have a damage bonus (f'rinstance, from the "bleeding edge" trait), you roll additional dice equal to the bonus and choose from the results. If you have a damage penalty (f'rinstance, from armor), you roll additional dice equal to the penalty and <i>your opponent</i> picks one of the results -- so, if you've got -1 damage, you have to roll "Dead" twice, so the probability drops sharply from 1/20 to 1/400.<br><br>What the mention of "armor effectiveness" refers to is that armor is divided into different classes: <br>clink: chainmail and plate<br/>street: reinforced leather, hoodies lined with light chain, phone books strapped to your chest<br/>tactical: kevlar, steel mesh, hard plastics, and ceramics<br/>gadget: customizable, mechanical armor<br/><br/>Each of these is effective against certain types of damage to varying degrees; f'rinstance, clink is really effective against edged weapons, only moderately effective against blunt weapons, and not very effective at all against piercing weapons and guns.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239881/#Comment_239881" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T03:28:10+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  3:28AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2009 3:30AM by Krippler.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnny is a Crasher.

The Ref has a lot of adjudicating to do, but it's not usually based on something without principled basis. I might just let Crashers get bonus damage on their Deathwish Attacks by wagering self-damage on the Accidental Injury table.

The Hardcase is a hardened, grizzled veteran. The Junk Knight is an expert at using gadgets to hurt people.

I was waiting for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHardcase and Maddog (is a mask really a must, though? I'd trust a hula-skirt of entrails would get the point across just as well) are both great, especially the Maddog's "kill the unsuspecting or helpless" thing. I'm a little worried about the Hardcase - he's a total loner, which is very awesome, but might maybe make his player lose out on the common fun in battle where everyone's talking to each other and making on-the-spot plans and stuff. When that happens, it seems like a Hardcase's job is either over (meaning other players had to wait for it to be over), or won't come at all. Not sure if this is an issue, but I thought I'd float it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Junk Knight though... I dunno, he seems to have some sort of vibe. Like, if in D&amp;D;, I went all "I am a fighter, but I am also a mage!". I can't tell without also seeing the Gearhead, but this guy seems like he's all "Yeah, I do gadgets like that guy, but I also am damned good at killing stuff." Seems like an overlap of colour where the Junk Knight hogs the spotlight. 'cause killing stuff is where it's at, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd maybe like to see him go in one of two directions - one, where he's more of a user of gadgets than a maker, some sort of cyborg with body grafts on his body grafts...<br/>\n<br/>\nOr him having a more direct, more intuitive approach to tech and machinery - stuff like using some sort of magnetised pole to stick two armoured foes together and then using that as a weapon, punching through some robot's hull and then using the hand inside to take control over it, throwing a wrench at a speeding car in a way that would make it deconstruct itself to pieces and then having those pieces impale the enemies present... Getting successes when evading mechanical traps he knows about, and using those same traps to fight enemies (changing the timing of the classic swinging blade, or something). Using random machinery to kill people. Making improvised mechanical stuff that lasts for that battle, but no longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething instead of his "I'm a maker and maintainer of complex gadgetry" aspects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240568/#Comment_240568" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T07:00:37+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  7:00AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the buddy score do anything else except color and learning from each other and is it cumulative or can two people have different relationships to each other?

You only need a mask if you're not already covered in blood. Or entrails, as stands to common sense as an extrapolation from blood, but would be fun to add into the description.<br><br>Junk Knight vs. Gearhead: the primary difference between these guys is flexibility and efficiency. The Junk Knight can repair and maintain any gadget, but can only [i]make[/i] combat gadgets. The Gearhead can make any kind of gadget, and is better and more efficient at maintenance and repair. If you're gonna have a Crasher with a motorbike, you'll need a Gearhead around; likewise, a Gearhead to attend to a Junk Knight's armor leaves the Junk Knight free to concentrate on weaponry and killing.<br><br>But, yeah, the item creation thing is inspired by D&amp;D's magic item creation. I like the fact that, in D&amp;D, being able to use and create magic items is part of the currency. I took it a step further, by making different kinds of special items (gadgets, oldTech, drugs, and talismans, so far) and dividing the knowledge of use and making between certain classes, and going another step further by adding the ability to instruct others in the use of certain special items. I'm excited about it, can't wait to see how it plays.<br><br>On the Buddy Score:<br>1. Other effects of it: positive scores can be called on for a once per job bonus to any action that is collaborative with or done for the sake of your buddy. He can also reciprocate once per job. Negative scores are applied as penalties to cooperative actions.<br><br/>2. The modifiers are cumulative with each other, but cap at -3 and +3. So, your Crasher and Maddog: the score is -3 because the Maddog is a fuckin' psycho. But let's say him and the Crasher are wearing the same style: +1, for a total of -2. Now let's say that the Crasher decides that the Maddog is the "most extreme" guy in the crew: +1, for a total of -1. But, wait, the Maddog also has drugs: +1, for a total of 0.<br/><br/>3. The modifiers in the handbooks apply only to <i>starting</i> relationships. The scores change over time based on the characters' interactions: how much they help each other out, how much they screw each other over, and whether we get some fun conversations roleplayed between them. Daumantas, this ties into your concern with the Hardcase: he's a loner, and thus has to gradually build relationships in order to become effective at teamwork.<br/><br/>4. Buddy Scores are mutual: both characters involved have the same score with each other. (I thought about them being individual, but I realized it would be hard to figure out which bonus/penalty could be applied to a given cooperative action.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240659/#Comment_240659" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T17:11:09+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  5:11PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite> stuff like using some sort of magnetised pole to stick two armoured foes together and then using that as a weapon, punching through some robot's hull and then using the hand inside to take control over it, throwing a wrench at a speeding car in a way that would make it deconstruct itself to pieces and then having those pieces impale the enemies present...

Maybe give him a small malus when there are no people around him that are either scared or dead? This would have the nice effect of him having to lug around corpses, or pieces of such, to stay at his optimum. Throphies and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, very small adjustment to the Hardcase that would make him, I think, much more awesome... When he stares someone down, the person he targeted becomes, for all intents and purposes, "in single combat" with the Hardcase. Like, the Hardcase looks at the guy and whispers "That one's mine," and the other guy is all like "Jesusfuck he's coming to get me!"<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth the Hardcase and his target can be shot at during this, but those two cannot pick other targets until their foe dies or leaves combat. Which means the Hardcase gets the pretty awesome niche of having to single out the meanest motherfucker of the opposing force and then takin' 'im on all by himself. Would essentially nullify the multi-hit possibilities an enemy Bruiser or a Carver has, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240798/#Comment_240798" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T11:48:45+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 11:48AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, the Maddog is only awesome if he can sneak up on you.

Make damn sure seems to occupy that position, but it seems like the guy's pretty much just allowed to waste bullets like candy there. Which is good and effective, but doesn't really capture the colour of the Shootist I'd like to play. Maybe, uh... Shootist always gets first shot? If he's the first to move in a specific battle (once per battle, not per round), his first bullet will allways hit?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ammo conservation rule is weird. Imagine this: I have a harpoon-gun with 1 shot. That's 1.5 shot, rounding up to 2 shots. I shoot them both at my enemies and kill them. I go over and collect my bolts, now I have 2. That's two whole reloads for the gun, therefore 2x1 == 2x1.5 == 2x2 = 4. I now have four shouts at people. Wouldn't be so weird if I couldn't collect the ammo afterwards, but even without that... I had 6 real bullets in my clip and used 9, all of which hit. So now there are more holes in the bodies than I had bullets. This can make sense sometimes - I shot through a guy and straight into another guy, or something. But if I keep using this skill, I'll have to keep thinking on how all those extra bullet wounds got there, which makes me distance myself from the game a bit...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe just, I dunno... allow the Shootist to never have to reload? As long as he has ammo, he can shoot. Or... he can empty his clip and shoot again next turn without spending an action to reload?<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, the Shootist is great. I especially like the hate/love relationship with other shootists... The "fuckin' amateurs" thing is also sweet. One thing that I immediatelly thought of after seeing the "make own bullets" thing was the "I've got a bullet with your name on it" line. Maybe allow Shootists to create special bullets once per job for killing enemies they know about and really hate?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tank is great. I was kind of picturing this huge guy walking around with a tiny psychotic crasher on his shoulder. They walk in an enemy-filled room, the Tank tosses the Crasher into the middle of it to do whatever crazy thing he planned... And the rest of the company just kind of huddle behind the Tank. No changes needed, but I would maybe like to see him using his armor offensively sometimes? Cracking skulls on it, crushing people with it... A simple adjustment would be to give the Charge! a +2 when there's a wall behind the enemies he's attacking. He doesn't just attack attack them... He runs into them and crushes them between his armor and the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, one very small thing - when a Tank cracks it, he <i>takes</i> his armor off, instead of ripping, busting, or tearing it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cooler... Man, his initial description is kind of lacking. Usually, when you talk about a class, you just kind of take me there, to the raw center of the abilities in question. For the Cooler, you're explaining things. If this makes sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, his job description seems to be to stop cool things from happening. Whatever cool and dangerous effect an enemy weirdo just cast, it's not there anymore, and nothing gasp-worthy is taking its place. Which is useful, but decidedly not awesome. Maybe give him some bonuses when fighting Occult Weirdos? Most of them should be damned afraid of him, at the very least. Also, the "contain magical energies" rule feels like it needs some extra oomph. Not in the sense of powering it up, but just... Making the action of storing the energies itself to have some sort of effect in the situation. "I have mystical energies in my belly" just doesn't seem to cut it, for me. Personally, I feel the need to somehow combine bloodletting and all his refrigerators somehow... Maybe he makes ice blades out of his own blood that shatter on impact and release some of the the weird magic along with that? Or maybe he chops up pieces (stringman's hand, tattooist's skin, gloomdoll's face...) off of peeps he slays, freezes them up (what is with me and corpse mutilation?), and every once in a while, drips some blood on them and makes use of their powers? Two weird things about him are the boiling magic-infused blood and the refrigerators, and methinks there should be more stuff on his sheet about that. Somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241105/#Comment_241105" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T13:50:48+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  1:50PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>Yay!<br>Where's the skill that makes sure that sometimes, a Shootist will under no circumstances miss?</br></blockquote>\nDamn, man, he's scary enough! He gets +2 whenever shooting guns, which is <i>really damn good</i>. Let's say he's got an average-ish HIT score of 11; with a +2 bonus, he'll have to roll over 11 <i>three times</i> to fail. That's, like, 9% chance of failure.\n<blockquote>The Ammo conservation rule is weird.</blockquote>\nNah, it's fine. The ammo scores on guns aren't the number of bullets in them. It's the number of attacks you can make with it before you have to reload. The ammo rules assume that each "attack" is going to consist of more than one shot, because that's how people actually fight with guns. The Shootist is the only person who even approaches "one bullet, one kill," although with most guns he isn't even that.<br><br>That, and it only counts for bullet-shooting guns. Stuff that's clearly a one-shot thing, like harpoon guns or bazookas, don't need ammo rules.\n<blockquote>"I've got a bullet with your name on it"</blockquote>\nThat's really interesting, although I'm not sure if there'd be much opportunity to use it. Of course, the Ref is encouraged to hand out bonuses for careful planning and cunning versions of actions, so something like that could still come into play in an impactful manner.<br><br>As for the Cooler, yeah, I'm not happy about his description. It's too boring and too long (my favorite descriptor is the Root Doctor, who I haven't posted yet. It's just, "Who do that hoodoo so well? This guy." and that's it). Just haven't thought of a better one yet.<br><br>I'll have to test it, but I'm pretty sure that the Cooler will be hugely devastating against magicians and magical monsters, as is.

The players make their own map as they go, assuming that their characters aren't moving too quickly to permit mapping. The map represents an in-game object that the PCs have and are making. The Arko (archaeologist) has skills that benefit this, allowing him to ask the Ref if X thing on the map is accurate, and, once per job, allowing him to peek at the Ref's map briefly.<br><br>Depth isn't what determines how bad things get. Only the time you spend in the dungeon. Time comes in categories, not really durations. In an extended time, nothing actiony happens, and it goes pretty slow, like when you're thoroughly searching a room, and the Ref adds 2 to the "Tension Meter." (Which I figure he doesn't show anyone; he tracks it in secret). A moderate time is a little faster -- smoke breaks happen in moderate time -- and the Ref only adds 1 to the Tension Meter. Quick time only occurs in action sequences, and adds no Tension, but does tend to lead to fatigue, which leads to resting, which leads to Tension.<br><br/>As the Tension Meter rises, worse and worse things start to become available for the Ref to throw at you. Including monsters. These things are collectively termed Contingencies, and are mechanized in a way that I totally ripped off from Cruel Fortunes in <i>Poison'd</i>.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241116/#Comment_241116" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T14:32:11+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  2:32PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2009 2:34PM by Krippler.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard to say not knowing how bad +0 on the weird magic table or a severe wound is.

With the exception of Snap Bang, a Helter-Skelter's skills are useless without either Build Up Your Firepower or Powerchild; a Gloomdoll's skills are useless without Hair &amp; Makeup; a Cooler's skills are useless without a PRU and a physique capable of lugging one around; a Root Doctor's skills are useless without a medicine bag; and so on. You can still learn magic from people, but in most cases it's difficult, requiring two steps.\n<blockquote>Succesfully containing threats gives you a payoff in the tactical dimension, but it doesn't much emotional impact situation-wise.</blockquote>\nI'm okay with that. Thematically, this game is about having a shit job but being good at it, and the strange mixture of pride and indignance that this circumstance produces. (There's more stuff to the game, like interference from upper management, rolls to subvert management, customer satisfaction surveys, and interns*, that really brings this to the forefront.) But, gameplay-wise, it's tactics and strategy all the way. It's Step On Up with a theme built in, but that theme is secondary.<br><br>Alexander and Daumantas, I'm curious why the potential harm that the Cooler might suffer as a result of containing energy doesn't make it interesting. Should the risk be higher? Crazier? Would you prefer that a certain degree of harm be mandatory?<br><br>* I'm REALLY excited about interns. They're sorta like hirelings in D&amp;D, except you're <i>encouraged</i> to put them at risk instead of yourself. There's no Charisma mechanic for controlling them; they do what they're told because they're interns. They're good guinea pigs, and also handy sources of certain rare resources (like, say, innocent blood). The catch is that they're roleplayed by the Ref, as <i>people</i>, hapless, helpless people who you're doing all this shit to. And the reward systems encourage you not to care.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241340/#Comment_241340" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T16:35:52+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  4:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the insubstantial lipstick!

See, you're supposed to turn it all in to sell. But what if you want to keep this cool weapon you found? You have to smuggle it into the supply room, but if you get caught you get written up. Get enough write-ups and you're fired. (Basically there's a parallel damage track to the physical and mental trauma ones, but it's long-term. Hell, maybe it even goes Blamed -&gt; Written Up -&gt; Suspended -&gt; Fired).<br/><br/>Other than that, the management can impose strictures as ways for the Ref to increase the challenge. Just think of any of the absurd policies that corporations come up with for how their employees should do their jobs, and then apply it to dungeoneering, basically.<br/><br/>I like the idea that the Hustler can save someone else's ass as well as his own, though.

The Ref will have to draw a map, but he won't have to key it or plan what's in all the rooms. He just needs a floorplan. The dungeon also needs to be a solid environment that the PCs can move about in at will, not a flowchart or linear sequence of encounters.

Right on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>So it's a game that starts out with strong niche protection and then immediately begins destroying it?

I just believe in giving the players a set of tools with strengths and weaknesses, then letting them try to turn it to their advantage. (Similarly, I don't believe in balance.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite><br/>Marshall, how much have you playtested it locally?</blockquote>\nI haven't playtested it yet. I have to scratch up a list of Acute Stress Disorders (the stuff that happens when you start losing sanity) and then I can playtest. And I just gotta write everything down and then there'll be a call for some outside alpha testers too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275047/#Comment_275047" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T17:07:38+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  5:07PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Actually, I am a Rocket Surgeon" has got to be the best tagline for a character I have ever heard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10793/madcorp-im-posting-class-handbooks-on-my-blog" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10793/madcorp-im-posting-class-handbooks-on-my-blog" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10793/madcorp-im-posting-class-handbooks-on-my-blog/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10793%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10793%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
