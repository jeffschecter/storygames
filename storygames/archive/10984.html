Plus, shipping becomes nightmarish, and in general your publication turns people away based on price-point and location.<br/><br/>I think that Jared &amp; Luke will be successful with publishing a FreeMarket boxed set, because they can pretty safely assume the risk that comes with quantity, and can sell that inflated cost based partially on reputation (and further on the fact that those book samples look really pretty!).<br/><br/>But, boxed sets have a lot of negatives to a publisher. Do you want to inflate your risk, deflate your profit margin and exclude potential buyers?<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think that boxed sets are how "we" would market roleplaying games to "the public", and break out of "our little niche".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243792/#Comment_243792" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T22:41:36+00:00" title="November 25, 2009 10:41PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I'd love more boxed sets.

Saying that "an RPG <b><i>is </i></b>a boxed set", as opposite to "<i><b>being </b></i>a book" for example, is bad, bad, bad language and a wrong, wrong, wrong habit. "An RPG" <i><b>is </b></i>an <b>activity</b>.<br/><br/>Anyway, wondering whether to put books into boxes or not, whether to put dice &amp; cards into those same boxes or not, etc., <i><b>per se</b></i>, looks no different than wondering whether white covers on books are "better" than black covers or not. A lot depends on the specific book/box/item, doesn't it? On its content, creator's vision, intended audience, marketing plan...<br/><br/>I believe the greatest problem with boxes to be the same as the greatest problem with (paper) books, anyway: physical artifacts that you need to physically move around the world to reach the audience, that customers need to physically carry around when they move, etc. So inefficient, so last century. Material storage of data is best used as a last resort emergency backup in case of <i>major </i>trouble, and that's it.<br/>Most boxed gamesets compound this with the added risk to lose single, tiny pieces which then become a pain to replace. Books, at list, are <i>tougher </i>as far as material artifacts go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243833/#Comment_243833" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T07:19:35+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  7:19AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I have to say that I'm not seeing a boxed future.

If anything, I'd pick the book as the thing that's going to go first - either your game has components that require a physical production, or it's just a text, in which case it'll be cheaper and more flexible to deliver it digitally. The place of the book right in the middle of this conundrum gets slimmer by the day. A boxed set that consists mostly of a book or two - that's double stupid when considered in terms of production logistics at a time when we're seriously considering the end of paper books altogether.

Being able to put an awesome boxed set under someone's tree at Christmas would fucking rule.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, I sort of like the general trend away from elaborate packaging, so maybe wrapping everything up in a glossy cardboard box isn't a very responsible thing to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243841/#Comment_243841" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T07:51:55+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  7:51AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tear and damage is actually a really good point when it comes to boxes. One would think that those plastic VHS boxes we use for <i>Zombie Cinema</i> were sturdy, but apparently something like 5% of any given batch gets minor cracks or other faults when they go through the IPR warehousing and shipping processes. Statistically they're much more likely to develop quality problems of this sort in shipping, storage and handling than simple books.<br/><br/>I expect that we'll see more rpg design that uses boardgame-like game components in the future, exactly because the niche of the book as an object of ownership will weaken drastically once the majority of the audience makes a shift to digital readers of various sorts. At that point it'll only make sense to sell texts or sell boardgames, which'll attract people publishers that ride on production values to focus on game component development that justifies selling the physical object instead of a digital text. I'm personally also prophesying that longer and more complex game texts will lose their static nature in favour of regular updates and evolution (like <i>Solar System</i>) as they make use of the new possibilities of digital delivery. So on the one hand we'll see more focus on production values and physical game components, while on the other hand we'll see games that become less object-like, less owned and more subscribed to and practiced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243845/#Comment_243845" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T08:15:57+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  8:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The Narrativa version of the jeepform game Doubt comes in an elegant lightweight corrugated box with die cuts and looks fantastic.

Because they have pieces, and rule books, and boards. Lots of little parts that need to be collected. When I started playing RPGs, all we ever had were the rule book, Generic Character Sheets (IE pieces of lined paper), and maybe 10 dice. And that was enough and it was also very appealing, since I didn't have a steady income, or any income, and buying miniatures, box sets, little pieces, tons of dice, wasn't really feasible. Not that RPG box sets are necessarily that but I think a box puts forth the impression that it holds more than just a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to say there isn't value in a box set. I think for some the box might be seen as adding value. It also does allow you to add things like dice, character sheets, and other things that help to play an RPG. For RPGs that use non-traditional or hard to obtain mechanical assistances like cards or spin wheels, boxes might be awesome. And they're certainly good for people who want to start collecting but aren't sure how to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days as a collector, I'm not a fan of boxes simply because of my shelving. Books are generally a uniform height but the boxes are not. Which means I'm buying a box that won't fit on my shelf. I have the same problems with DVDs and "collector" cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243865/#Comment_243865" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T11:16:48+00:00" title="November 26, 2009 11:16AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2009 11:31AM by Graham.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ihmcallister</cite>I love the idea of boxed sets especially for games designed to introduce people to roleplaying.

For a product like that, the store should suck it up and provide a demo copy that you can not only look through but play at their tables.<br/>-----<br/>As others have said, providing a boxed version only makes sense in a few instances:<br/>* Many, custom play aides or minis or dice or accessories - This also works for the "all you need to play!" pitch to customers (especially new gamers!). That was the hook of the D&amp;D boxed set: rules, a module, dice (and sheets?) all in one place, ready to roll.<br/>* Multiple books - I'm looking at the full Burning Wheel line, here. I've even suggested (*ahem* begged) Luke et al to come up with a slipcase box that holds all four books, to replace the FedEx shipping box I now use to protect them in a backpack. But if a product, generally, comes with two or three books, a slipcase (or box) can rock because of that protection. Yes, shrink-wrapping works on the warehousing and distribution half, but I'm talking about the FAR rougher day-to-day handling and transport to play sessions.<br/>* Theme - This speaks to Zombie Cinema (and PTA, etc); if the game suits delivery in a "themed" container, then that's just clever packaging. "Rock Star:  the RPG" in a CD case; ZC in a video cassette case; It Was a Mutual Decision in a chocolate box (heart-shaped optional).<br/>* Different retailing channels - I'll bet you'd never get a soft-cover RPG book into, say, Toys R Us. Box that shit up, and it goes right onto the "board game" shelves, no muss no fuss (other than your need to somehow present the RPG aspect, to avoid customer confusion or dissatisfaction--viz How To Host a Murder, which also has the "multiple components" issue, obviously).<br/><br/>At the moment, I can't think of any other good reasons to box an RPG. Maybe brainstorming more as to WHY one would box an RPG wuld make it easier to remove the "all" or the "should" from the thread title?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244617/#Comment_244617" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T09:39:35+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  9:39AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they're themed right, they are way more immersive for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244646/#Comment_244646" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T11:43:10+00:00" title="December  2, 2009 11:43AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.

I moved to boxes not to get the effect of the old boxed D+D games but instead to get the effect of the old Avalon Hill bookshelf board games. If you game uses a nice map, pretty counters and fairly loose leaf rules sheets or booklets then a box makes sense. That being said - boxes are a lot of work to make. I spent as much time on the fabricating the box wrap as I do making the game board! <br/><br/>Rigid set up boxes are not that expensive. You can buy them by the hundred from Uline for $1.50 a box. But getting cover art on them is tough.<br/><br/>If your game is in a box I would hope people can be playing it pretty soon after opening it. My goal is for it to be playable in five minutes.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
