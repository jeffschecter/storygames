Thing is, aside from reading Levi's articles, I'm not really sure how to use the site. There's a lot of features, buttons and the like, but I'm not really sure what we're supposed to do, how we're supposed to interface with Amagi.<br/><br/>Levi, I'm thinking an easy-to-find FAQ, like, "What is this site about and how do I use it/the features/etc" and the like would help out. In the interim, could you perhaps drop some lines on how you imagine a new user (say, someone who stumbles onto your site and is interested in doing new tricks in gaming) is supposed to use the site? <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175366/#Comment_175366" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T20:37:10+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  8:37PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2008 8:49PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This...   is not as easy a question as you might think.<br/><br/>A quick note on "success" first, to give a sense of the scale I think on: Amagi has been successful (by my standards) right from the get-go as a blog - about 110-170 different visitors a day.  With the new site, that's jumped up to 280-360.  That's actual people; search spiders and the like are sorted out for me.  They each read an average of 7.5 pages a visit.<br/><br/>Now, the first purpose of the site was really simple: I have stuff.  Little stuff like articles, big stuff like games, and stuff in between.  I wanted to share it, and let people give me input, and let <i>them</i> share it, and so on.<br/><br/>At some point, it got really obvious that wiki-type function would be handy on some of those things, at least potentially; rather than just giving feedback, people that were irked by a thing or wanted to expand on it could <i>just do it</i>.  And I coul host files right on the site.<br/><br/>Then, as soon as I actually had it, the thought occurred:<br/><br/>There's no reason for me not to open up the offer much, much wider, and let people just add articles, games, do projects on the site, <i>whatever they want to do</i>.  I needed a little playground for myself, and ended up with one that can basically accomodate as many people as want to mess about there; it's got slides and teeter-totters, all these gubbins and fiddly things.  Oodles and buckets of stuff, and I haven't even turned on half the options.<br/><br/>So, really, the place I'm at is one where I'm kind of casting around, trying to sort out <i>"what do people want to collaborate on or share that they don't have a platform for?"</i>...    Because I have <b>so much</b> extra room, <b> so many</b> available tools, and such an amazingly open-to-fun-ideas audience, it seems like a horrible shame not to open it up.<br/><br/>Er, if I'm making sense.<br/><br/>(And, yes, I'm open to suggestions.  If that wasn't obvious)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175369/#Comment_175369" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T21:00:08+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  9:00PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah.  I should have posted this first.  Some ideas in my head:<br/><br/>1.  Do you have any old forum posts or blog posts you've made that are effectively "articles" that you'd like to give another shot of life, and don't mind them being a really open environment?  I want them.<br/><br/>2. Do you have a freebie gamething (a fiddly little thing, a playtest doc, a quickstart) you want to "drop off" somewhere that it'll get a few downloads?  I'd love to host it.<br/><br/>3. Do you have a project you'd like to do "in public", with others, that doesn't work on your usual playgrounds, for whatever reason (format or software needs, most especially)?  It might work on Amagi, it might not; I'm open to you giving it a shot.<br/><br/>4. Got another idea that starts with "I want to collaborate / share / peerify", and it's tabletop or Larp gamestuff?  You don't need to ask permission.  Go ahead; swing on the teetertotters, bounce on the monkeybars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175382/#Comment_175382" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-18T06:29:49+00:00" title="October 18, 2008  6:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome, and exactly what I was looking for.<br/><br/>Also, do you have a primer on which tools do what, or how to make the best use of them?

Wow, I must be off my nut.  Lemme fix that: <a>Amagi Games</a><br/><br/>Okay, a quick rundown.<br/><br/>On the site, that block of links on the left?  Those are all just wiki-links.  Games is for listing games on-site.<br/><br/>Gambits, Situation, and Advice are there to categorise any articles you drop on so they can be found fairly easily.  If articles start showing up that need a new category, I'll made one and put in a shortcut for that, too.<br/><br/>"News &amp; Feed" is just what it sounds like; it's a series of articles that go out on the feed.  At the moment, only admins can post to it, though that'll change.  "Files"  and "Images" are data repositories; if you want to host a whole block of connected files, let me know so I can make a new gallery.  <br/><br/>The forum is a "backstage" for site stuff and chat, and later a place to goof around with the others doing that same stuff.  Visiting the site <i>for the forum</i> is backwards - it's a assistance tool, not the main show.  <br/><br/>"My Tiki" is a list of all the stuff you, user, have interacted with on the site.<br/><br/>So that's what the stuff IS.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>As far as I can say, the wiki categories are best for sharing little things - an article, a treatise, a chunk of theory, a game review.<br/>The file galleries are best for sharing bigger things - PDFs, games, and so on.<br/><br/>And to be honest, the best way to use the tools is to have a goal - a thing you want to do.  Then poke the tools, see where it fits.  If it doesn't fit the tools?  Shout for me in the forums, and I'll see what I can do - I can tell the site to make blogs, and a whole host of other stuff.  In many cases (people I know and feel reassured about), if it looks like you want to be active and might benefit from access to more tools, I'll just hit the button and give you admin powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190092/#Comment_190092" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T14:52:00+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  2:52PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Levi, what's the current status of Amagi?
