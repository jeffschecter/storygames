If you also have an end point in your game, a "victory point", I'd also love to hear about that.<br/><br/>If you'd write a short piece or even a long article on the matter I'd love to post it up on my <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Competitive RPGs Blog</a>, perhaps with some editorial notes or comments.<br/><br/>I am doing this because I came to realise it is lacking in the way of concrete design advice, and I figure the best way to do that right now is by way of example; of making an example case from a design solution/method and from generalizing it.<br/><br/>I will send PMs to certain people to ensure they see this thread and email people who don't frequent Story-Games, if you know such people, please forward this request to them and/or forward me their emails. My email is tundranocaps@gmail.com<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Guy Shalev.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
