I think I usually do it if I wouldn't play the game/expansion otherwise. If it turns out I like it I can still contribute and it's a win-win. I'm thinking of giving a game another shot right now that I probably wouldn't have, because it had a free expansion\u2014I haven't downloaded the expansion yet because, like you, I have ambivalent feelings about not paying for something when it's "pay what you want"\u2014but I figure that if I was the designer I would way rather someone try my game out than decide not to download it because of ambivalence...but I definitely agree about contributing something later if it's a great game. It's stupid not to, even from the point of self interest, you want to fund  good games so there will be more of them. Anyway, you should download it, you can always contribute later if you dig it :-)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_ONeal" title="Ben_ONeal"><img alt="Ben_ONeal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_ONeal">Ben_ONeal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465229/#Comment_465229" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T13:10:13+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  1:10PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys! <br/><br/>Yeah I'm really experimenting with the payment model. PWYW seems to be really controversial, with some people having terrible experiences with it, and others having huge success. And on the buyer-side, for some it creates apprehension and an uncomfortable decision point, while for others, the flexibility is freeing and makes them feel more generous. Humans are such complex and varied creatures!!<br/><br/>I'm just trying to find something that works for me. My gut tells me that aesthetics like good art and slick layout are the sorts of things that people really value, more than the rules themselves. So the greyscale rules (which are absolutely complete, art and all) are free, while the full colour super-pretty rules cost money. The mobile reference "stretch goal" is an experiment to see if people also value convenience, particularly in that form-factor, because I have a hunch that the ability to pull out your phone and click on a few page numbers to jump directly to rule references is something that some might value. <br/><br/>So far, after 48 hours, I'd say I'm really happy with the results! A little over half the downloads have been for the free version, but with the other half, most have sprung for the mobile reference, and half a dozen people have even thrown me a full $10! <br/><br/>I've got a ton of work ahead of me, most of which I am completely clueless about, like ongoing marketing post-release, value-adds like premade "campaigns" and characters, and figuring out what the hell to do with all these people on my mailing list now. <br/><br/>If any of you have <i>any</i> experience or insights into any of this hard stuff, I'd be eternally grateful if you'd share it with me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465230/#Comment_465230" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T13:23:28+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  1:23PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2017 1:29PM by BeePeeGee.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Ben_ONeal">@Ben_ONeal</a> , great things are rolling out well.

I'll look into them asap. <br/><br/>Stripe is actually amazing. They are like PayPal, in that they handle credit cards so that I don't have to (FAR more secure for customers), but Stripe are much better for merchants and consumers, and with much stricter policies on fraud and dodgy businesses. They even blocked one of my customers from buying the game because he hadn't updated his address with his bank!<br/><br/>So I can imagine a lot of shady people being really angry with them, but for me, they are exactly what I'm looking for: a reliable, extremely well-made payment provider. <br/><br/>I initially tried setting up to take payments with PayPal, but ran into so many bugs and issues and their development servers constantly throwing errors and crashing... but I would have stuck with it for the familiarity with consumers, if it weren't for one incredibly frustrating limitation: they force me to be accountable for the money. If I ever want to open up my website to allow other indie devs to sell their games on it (which I do), PayPal would force me to take the full payment, and then I'd be responsible for distributing that payment to the devs, and I'd have to handle refunds and support. <br/><br/>Stripe, on the other hand, allows me to set payments to just go directly to the other dev, without ever touching my bank account. This is an absolute deal-breaker for me, as I never ever want to be responsible for other people's money, and PayPal force that on me, so I'll never use them as a payment provider. <br/><br/>Plus they <b>just work</b>, and I've found them to be far more professional and responsive, and superior in every regard. <br/><br/>/rant<br/><br/>But yeah I'll look into those browsers. I developed the whole site alone in my evenings so I haven't had the opportunity to properly check it on most device/browser combinations, and there are <i>a lot</i>, so fixes may take a while to roll out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465551/#Comment_465551" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-12T14:37:33+00:00" title="August 12, 2017  2:37PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the info on Stripe.

I'm a web developer by trade, with a history in Graphic/UI/UX design. The awesome centrepiece was done by <a href="http://bernardmalijan.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">Bernardino Malijan</a>. I would have totally used him for all the art if I could have afforded it (self-funded), because he was excellent to work with and I love his style. <br/><br/>I'm not planning on bothering with DTRPG. I have no personal experience with them, but I've read that they are only worthwhile if you can keep your game on the front page, which requires a lot of constant effort. Once it drops off the front page, it's effectively invisible and visibility is the only value that DTRPG offers. As a seller, you get zero analytics, zero customization of your game's page, and the site does nothing to help you reach potentially interested customers (beyond the standard "buyer's who bought this also bought..."). &lt;- this is all feedback I've read from people who have successfully sold games on DTRPG. <br/><br/>Personally, I know I can do better than that, so I plan on investing my time and efforts into improving and marketing my own site.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465616/#Comment_465616" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-15T01:45:22+00:00" title="August 15, 2017  1:45AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bernardino's stuff looks awesome, but dude, no need to pay for art when your own is that good!
