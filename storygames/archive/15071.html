This<br/>element can be found in numerous contexts from child's play to<br/>training and research. The most common recreational role-playing games<br/>include tabletop role-playing games, live action role-playing games<br/>(larps) and massively multiplayer role-playing games (MMORPGs).<br/>Different forms of role-playing, pretend-play, and make-believe can be<br/>traced throughout human history.<br/><br/>Role-Play in Games seminar brings together researchers of role-playing<br/>and role-playing games. Submissions from a wide variety of research<br/>fields are welcome, as long as the findings have relevance for<br/>role-playing in games.<br/><br/>The possible list of topics includes but is not limited to:<br/> - Theoretical analyses of role-playing in role-playing games, larps,<br/>online role-playing games, as well as of role-playing in any other<br/>types of games<br/> - Case studies<br/> - Typologies and ways of interpreting role-playing games and game cultures<br/> - Learning in and education through role-playing games<br/> - Playful role-playing in non-game contexts<br/> - History or development of role-playing in games<br/> - Role-playing games in the context of art, design or creativity<br/> - Industries relating to role-playing<br/> - Social psychology of role-playing in games<br/> - Design and structure of role-playing games<br/><br/>Role-Play in Games is the 8th in the annual series of game studies<br/>working paper seminars organized by the University of Tampere Game<br/>Research Lab. Due to the work-in-progress emphasis, we strongly<br/>encourage submitting late breaking results, working papers and<br/>submissions from graduate students. Early considerations from projects<br/>currently in progress are most welcome, as the purpose of the seminar<br/>is to have peer-to-peer discussions and thereby provide support in<br/>refining and improving research work in this area.<br/><br/>The seminar is partnered with the International Journal of<br/>Role-Playing (which was founded in the 2006 seminar Playing Roles),<br/>and the best papers will be invited to be further developed for<br/>potential publication in a special journal issue.<br/><br/>The papers to be presented will be chosen based on extended abstract<br/>review. Full papers are distributed prior the event to all<br/>participants, in order to facilitate discussion. The two-day event<br/>consists of themed sessions that aim to introduce current research<br/>projects and discuss ongoing work. The seminar will be chaired by<br/>professor Frans M\xe4yr\xe4 (School of Information Sciences, University of<br/>Tampere). The seminar will also feature two invited paper<br/>commentators, to be confirmed later. The seminar will be held in<br/>Tampere, Finland and will be free of charge; the number of<br/>participants will be restricted.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT DATES<br/><br/> - Abstract Deadline: January 23, 2012<br/> - Notification of Acceptance: February 7, 2012<br/> - Full Paper deadline: March 19, 2012<br/> - Seminar dates: April 10-11, 2012<br/><br/>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br/><br/>The papers will be selected for presentation based on extended<br/>abstracts of  500-1000 words (plus references). Abstracts should be<br/>sent to  as plain text only (no<br/>attachments). Full paper guidelines will be provided with the<br/>notification of acceptance.<br/>Our aim is that all participants can familiarize themselves with the<br/>papers in advance. Therefore, the maximum length for a full paper is<br/>5000 words (plus references). The seminar presentations should<br/>encourage discussion, instead of repeating the information presented<br/>in the papers. Every paper will be presented for 10 minutes and<br/>discussed for 20 minutes.<br/><br/>SOLMUKOHTA<br/><br/>The seminar is loosely connected to the Nordic role-playing convention<br/>Solmukohta 2012 (aka Knutepunkt). Since the first event, held in 1997,<br/>Solmukohta has evolved into the main meeting point between Nordic<br/>role-playing gamers, designers and researchers. The event features<br/>panels, lectures, workshops, games and parties. The annual event tours<br/>between Nordic capitals and in 2012 it is organized in near Helsinki<br/>(two hours on the train from Tampere) on April 12-15. It is very easy<br/>to combine attending Role-Playing in Games research seminar, and<br/>Solmukohta 2012.<br/><br/>Seminar website: <a href="http://roleplayingames.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://roleplayingames.wordpress.com/</a><br/>Organised by: <a href="http://gamelab.uta.fi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gamelab.uta.fi</a><br/>Solmukohta website: <a href="http://www.solmukohta.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.solmukohta.org/</a><br/>International Journal of Role-Playing: <a href="http://journalofroleplaying.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://journalofroleplaying.org/</a><br/>University of Tampere / SIS / Game Research Lab<br/><br/>PS.<br/>2012 is a big year for the Game Research Lab as it marks the ten year<br/>anniversary of our first international academic conference on games,<br/>Computer Games and Digital Cultures held in 2002. Thus in addition to<br/>the traditional spring seminar we are hosting Nordic DiGRA 2012 on<br/>June 6-8. The conference hosts full paper tracks, keynotes, panels and<br/>workshops for PhD and MA students. The articles will be subjected to a<br/>double blind peer review and published in the DiGRA Digital Library.<br/>For more information, see www.digra-nordic2012.org                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342643/#Comment_342643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T15:50:44+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  3:50PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2011 3:53PM by Emily_Care.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like Jonathan Walton already put this up in the things to watch thread. Sorry for the duplication. <br/><br/>I like the approach they are taking for this particular conference: people are encouraged to report on research in progress. It seems as though game research is a relatively new discipline. We should be formulating research questions and bringing projects into being. No shame in beginning. It makes me want to look at some questions I'm puzzling out as such. Narrative structure, non-standard mechanics and structures in rpgs, game task distribution. Hm.<br/><br/>I'm considering writing a piece on freeform game structures for this conference. Evan Torner, perhaps our methodology experiment idea would be a good candidate? Talk about in progress. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>I'd love to hear what other folks are up to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
