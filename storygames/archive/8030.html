Actually it's not entirely my game, its a collaboration between me and my wife, inspired by a Valentine's Day design contest run by Graham Walmsley at the start of this year. I wrote the first draft of the game as a present to my wife, and she decided to work with me to bring it to a finished version.<br/><br/>So what is Eekamouse in Atlantis, and why the weird name?<br/><br/>Well it's a game about lost toys, and the adventures they have after they are lost, in Atlantis, which is where all lost toys go to make a new life for themselves when their owners are gone. Our intent is for it to be both light-hearted, whimsical and a little bittersweet, especially if you ever lost a toy of your own as a child and remember just how horrible that was. It's in many ways a simple adventure game; your characters fight monsters (giant squid, sharks, isopods) and save princesses (well princess dolls anyway). It's also a game about learning who your character's are, now that they don't have owners to tell them, and how they come to terms with being lost.<br/><br/>So why the name? When my wife was a child she had a little mouse toy that she called Eekamouse, who got lost one day when she was sick in hospital and was never found again. Many years later, just after Graham had announced his contest in fact, she saw a post on the BBC news comment page from "Eeek a Mouse in Atlantis". Finally we knew where Eekamouse had gone, and I knew what game I ought to be writing for her.<br/><br/>We've been working on Eekamouse for most of the year, playing it with friends, and doing the artwork too (well I've been doing the artwork <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>, and now we are confidant it is ready for more public consumption. At my wife's suggestion we are producing a short run of Ashcans that we will be taking to Dragonmeet in London later this month, and I'm also very interested in finding people who might be interested in playtesting or commenting on the current draft. If you are, and are willing to promise that I will hear from you again, then whisper me and I'll send you a PDF.<br/><br/>Anyway I've rambled on enough, so I'll stop here, but if you have any questions, please ask.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177854/#Comment_177854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-09T09:55:41+00:00" title="November  9, 2008  9:55AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick note of thanks to the people who whispered me to offer playtesting help.

They also have a key motivation, which represents how they feel about being lost (The motivations are For Myself, For Answers, For my Owner). Motivations also provide dice, as do items, specializations and so forth.<br/><br/>Tests are dice contests with GM controlled opposition (called Trouble). Successes are used to inflict damage, narrate facts, find items, add complications, or can be rolled forward into your (or other toy's) subsequent tests. Flashbacks to times with your owner (or the day you were lost) provide chances for further successes (again enhanced by motivations) and further bonus dice.<br/><br/>Scenario creation is generally collaborative, with all players choosing a Goal and then defining a series of Chapters (rather like Donjon dungeon levels) that have to be gone through to reach it. The Storyteller then creates trouble that gets in the way of the goal, although the players can do this too to a smaller extent.<br/><br/>There is also an economy element in the form of Wishes, which are given out for defeating trouble, or saved by converting excess successes. Wishes can be spent on healing, extra dice, guaranteed successes and the like, and can be used to buy new abilities and items, and to change motivations, after an adventure is over.<br/><br/>Oh and it has lots and lots of giant squids ... and clams ... and isopods, and isopods in particular are not rubbish, so you should have no problems there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178155/#Comment_178155" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T07:21:24+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  7:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've not posted a link to the sneak preview of the art, so I didn't want to "out" the link myself.<br/><br/>Any chance you can show off the art here?
