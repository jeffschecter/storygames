On a personal note, I've been wanting to do a Kickstarter, but holding off on doing a Kickstarter, for a few years now. With my enormous levels of social and general anxiety, I definitely lean toward being the kind of person who'd rather never try something than do it and risk a non-zero chance of failure. I was irrationally convinced that we would get exactly $0.00 of our goal and become the laughing stock of the entire internets.<br/><br/>Well...basically...I was wrong.<br/><br/>We got funded in five days.  We've hit a hundred backers already, which is monumental. Heck we got a new backer while I was writing this post! We've got almost forty days left, we've got stretch goals (some of those stretch goals involve story games posters and other folks you might know the names of), people are still pledging, and it's looking like Psionics is going to be, if not "the next big" thing, then very much "a thing", and that's awesome. I went from being stupendously relieved we were not a complete abject failure as I was sure in my heart we would be, to enormously grateful to all our supporters (still am!), to straight up ecstatic, to just plain excited--and on some level it still very much feels like we're just getting started. So check it out.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endtransmissiongames/psionics" rel="nofollow">PSIONICS!</a></b><br/><br/>Psionics is a tabletop roleplaying game using the DicePunk System, which was featured in our ENnie Nominated <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/108942/Phantasm-2010" rel="nofollow">Phantasm(2010)</a> (which you can check out for free if you like; it's Pay What You Want). In Psionics, PCs take on the role of Espers--troubled young people with tremendous psychic powers--hunted by various shadowy Conspiracies that seek to enlist them to their sinister agendas, coming to grips with their own unique abilities, the characters must navigate a volatile world with even more volatile gifts, and make hard choices about using dangerous powers to achieve their goals, and retain their freedom.<br/><br/>Psionics isn't strictly speaking a storygame. It's an old-fashioned indie roleplaying game. Instead of writing sad things on index cards, you create and portray a character with statistics that specifically represent their abilities. There is a gamemaster. And so on. Still, I'd never in any universe use the word "trad(itional) to describe any of my RPGs. Compared to most roleplaying games I'd describe Psionics as "rules-lite". To the story games crowd, I might describe it as more like "rules- medium". I won't go on here because there's loads more info on the Kickstarter. I just imagine there's plenty of overlap between folks interested in story games and folks interested in indie RPGs with punk philosophies and aesthetics, so I thought I'd just leave this here.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436597/#Comment_436597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T15:45:12+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  3:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congrats on funding! <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436606/#Comment_436606" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T20:32:19+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  8:32PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congrats here too!

There certainly is a tactical element. It's pretty involved. There's not a lot of positional finagling and you probably don't need a battle mat (most things work on line of sight), but the more and more you use your Psi talents in one encounter, the more risk you run of damaging yourself into unconsciousness, or even overloading, causing you to begin uncontrollably killing everyone around you in a spectacular fashion. So that escalating risk/gamble of balancing power and danger is a mental calculus you're almost always performing. Besides, you know, the usual tactical stuff of "using what powers and using them how would be best in this situation".<br/><br/>Andy:<br/>Fair enough.<br/><br/>Extensive discussion on the whys of the game title is found <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endtransmissiongames/psionics/comments" rel="nofollow">here</a>: scroll to the very bottom, and then read up through my next few comments, for a better understanding of why it is just called 'Psionics'.  Short version, I've been calling it that for the 14 years it's been in development, and it's so ingrained I can't bring myself to change that; I'm just too emotionally/intellectually invested in the original title, even if it's a little bit generic. From there the conversation went to "14 years in development? uh oh, this sounds like backwards antediluvian dreck designed in a complete blind vacuum" and from there to "not so much, and here's why". But read it if you're interested.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission" title="EndTransmission"><img alt="EndTransmission" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/428/nBVTR0D284U65.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission">EndTransmission</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438224/#Comment_438224" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T14:24:05+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  2:24PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And just popping back in now that our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endtransmissiongames/psionics" rel="nofollow">KS is down to its final 48 Hours!</a> : )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
