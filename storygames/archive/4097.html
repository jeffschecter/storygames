I'd just read Dust Devils again and it was my first choice.  I used Hans' clever <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24632" rel="nofollow">wedding massacre</a> situation generator, cadged NPCs from the example in the book, and we were off to the races.  My contribution to the chaos was the setting - Lebanon, Missouri, 1867.  The bride, Corinne, was the daughter of an ambitious southern plutocrat eager to get in the good graces of the occupation forces.  Corinne's Present is "Gettin' sold off".  The groom, Jake, was a local boy who was a Jayhawk during the war and is now a carpetbagger, lording over his former friends and relatives.  Jake was definitely a bastard.  The final NPC was a nascent Klansman sheriff who once rode with Nathan Forrest.<br/><br/>Character generation is really simple and fun.  We had a good crew.  Clyde, whose Devil was "selfishness".  Silas, whose Devil was "Self-Righteousness".  John, whose Devil was "Guilt", and Burkey, whose Devil was "Indecision".  Three of them gravitated to the groom - the groom needed Clyde (to kill John, as it turned out).  The groom was in Silas' way (because Corinne promised Silas all her land if he could stop the wedding).  John was in the groom's way (because his land bisected the plantations he would inherit by marrying Corinne).  And finally Burkey had been spurned by the bride - and still carried a torch for her.  That didn't end well.  <br/><br/>I wasn't super prepared to run Dust Devils, but the game's instructions are almost luminously clear, and we had no huge problems.  We kept finding ourselves in archetypal, cinematic western scenes, which was very satisfying.  At one point Burkey was being strung up in the cemetery by a mob led by the sheriff, and Clyde was already there, busy digging up his father's grave.  The evil sheriff looked down, tipped his hat, and said "give my regards to your pa, Clyde" before returning to the business of the hanging.  This turned into undiluted awesome when Clyde pried open his father's casket and removed the tarnished tin star from his rotting lapel - establishing that his old man had been the <i>real</i> sheriff, murdered by the new sheriff.  Cue the gunfight!  We got a new sheriff now!  The game was stuffed with moments like that.  Dust Devils really delivered.<br/><br/>Oh!  And Corinne didn't get married.  The groom beat Burkey to death with a fireplace poker (Burkey's winning stake!) in front of the assembled wedding guests, after which Clyde, the new sheriff, took him away to jail.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91563/#Comment_91563" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T07:02:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  7:02AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 7:02AM by Matt Snyder.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>This turned into undiluted awesome when Clyde pried open his father's casket and removed the tarnished tin star from his rotting lapel - establishing that his old man had been the<i>real</i>sheriff, murdered by the new sheriff.

I'm concerned that we were missing something though, since we blew through the story in shotgun-fashion and were done in two hours.  By the end, two of the player characters were dead or dying (one or more traits at zero).  does that seem possible based on the mechanics, or did we miss something important?<br/><br/>As a caveat, our group does have a tendency to move quickly through a story.

Some people don't like that Dust Devils plays out well in one evening, and that they want to stretch it out more. I've talked about techniques for doing that on my Chimera Creative forum at the Forge.<br/><br/>Dust Devils should play out in 1-3 sessions, usually. Going longer is possible, but some groups find it difficult without some rules changes (and they can vary -- things like wiping out harm each session, or "reverting" harm that doesn't hit zero, or reducing harm originally inflicted and so on).<br/><br/>So, I recognize that concern. But, Dust Devils as a text and a game is right where I want it -- punch you in the gut, knock you on your ass play that will, in many cases, get you to come back for more. As in "Last time was a mess, but great. Let's see this  time what happens if we do it <i>this</i> way ... " Stuff like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91632/#Comment_91632" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:45:47+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's certainly how the game went for us.  I was just concerned that we didn't take the time to savor it properly, or that we missed an important mechanic somewhere.  For example, we had a number of three-way conflicts, where two PCs and an NPC were involved, all with different goals.  Invariably this meant that at least one of the PCs took harm, usually to the tune of 3 or 4 harm each time.  One player lost every conflict he was in (but I think he still had fun doing it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91661/#Comment_91661" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T09:20:12+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  9:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you guys use any chips during the game?

You can use them to Fold, which people probably don't think about much in the thick of it. They can also fend off Harm. Depending on how you want to play, using Chips to fend off harm can be a big deal. That said, it sounds like you guys had a great time, and quick-and-dead play was great.

I'm curious to see how I'd "handle" it.<br/><br/>FYI, what you probably did was the way Dust Devils "used" to work. It wasn't broken, really. The reason I "fixed" it was to make a much more understandable and simple process for complex conflicts of 3 or more people in conflict in various ways. It can get confusing "Wait, no, you and I aren't in conflict, so ... wait." That happened some in old version play. The way to deal with it was just say "Well, the narrator just decides the whole she-bang." Which worked, but also caused other oddities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91699/#Comment_91699" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:23:53+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clyde:  "I want to shoot the Sheriff dead."

I freely admit that the idea owes a lot to Grey Ranks, so I guess what goes around comes around, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to multiparty conflicts: the rules only state that the hand that loses to everyone cannot do Harm.  It is up to the narrator whether the loser's goal succeeds or fails.  Therefore, Jason, your situation is not really a quandary.  The narrator MUST let Clyde get his goals, and the fact that Berkey shares those goals is just lucky for Berkey.  The narrator DOES get to decide whether the Sheriff's goal succeeds or fails, because the Sheriff beat at least one of his opponents.  The narrator also decides whether the Sheriff's hand does harm to Clyde and/or Berkey (Clyde must do harm to the Sheriff, and Berkey can't do any harm).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis demonstrates both the problem and the advantage, tactically, with "teaming up".  Because Berkey teamed up with Clyde, Berkey gets his goal.  But because Berkey teamed up with Clyde (instead of, say, sitting out of the conflict), the Sheriff might do harm.  If Berkey had stayed out of it, even if the Sheriff had won narration rights, he could not do harm to Clyde (as he would have beaten no opponent).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the number of participants in a conflict grows, the more important it is to be very explicit in each conflict round about who is actually opposing who.  You can only do harm to your opponents, and you only compare your hand with your opponents as well.  This can end up with, for example, more than one truly "winning" hand and more than one truly "losing" hand, if the goals line up the right way, as in:<br/>\n<br/>\nClyde: "I want to gun the Sheriff down" (opposes Sheriff and Berkey)<br/>\nSheriff: "I want to gun Clyde down" (opposes Clyde, Berkey, and Cletus)<br/>\nBerkey: "I want to get Clyde out of town and on his way to Mexico" (opposes Sheriff and Clyde)<br/>\nCletus: "I want to convince the townsfold that the Sheriff should be kicked out" (opposes Sheriff)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case above, both Berkey and Cletus could end up with "winning" hands (i.e. they beat all of their opponents) since they do not oppose each other in any way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91863/#Comment_91863" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T14:29:41+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  2:29PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Hans, I thought the guy who is lowest (beating no one) explicitly is denied his stake.
