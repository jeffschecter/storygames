But by the subtleties of the movie.  <br/><br/>A lot of games I am in tend to move towards violence or comedy.  I think because those are "easy".  It's easier to throw two people into bed or pull a gun on someone than it is to deal with human frailty.  <br/><br/>So help me remember some games that find a way to get across the subtleties of human interactions.  And how those games do that through their mechanics.<br/><br/>Dogs is about the only one I can think of at the moment; with its rules for raising and escalating.

(In <i>Dogs</i>, for example, I have seen both very subtle and excessive drama.)<br/><br/>So, IME, dramatic explosions are "easier", but that doesn't mean people are being lazy.

I think I also agree with Tim here. You can maybe havea a game that sets up the stage for subtlety, but like in writing fiction, bringing that out in the moment often depends on practice and skill of the author.<br/><br/>To explain that analogy: Your game could say, "then make a subtle statement." Or it could try to explain what subtlety is and say you get a token if you're subtle. But that still doesn't mean the player can reliably do that. Just like if you have a book on writing novels, and it tells you to put in a subtle detail on every page or whatnot, that doesn't mean that when you've got your page in front of you the subtle sentence just presents itself to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94482/#Comment_94482" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T16:48:01+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  4:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caesar, can you give an example of what you consider subtle?

These are pretty subtle, but hopefully you'll get what I'm after.<br/><br/><i>Double Indemnity</i>: throughout the entire movie, Keyes always ends up lighting Neff's cigars for him.  At the end of the movie when Keyes in dying, Neff lights a cigarette for him.  It highlights a switch in the roles of the two characters.<br/><br/><i>Out of the Past</i>: Jeff Bailey/Markham is continually making references to Kathie moving, often because he can't control where she is or where she goes. "She came in from out of sun"...or..."You're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another."<br/><br/><i>Gilda</i>: Gilda practically does a striptease in front of the crowd at Johnny's casino.  The people there just think she's drunk and she's pulled stunts to embarrass him in public before.  But really she's trying to live up to Johnny's expectation that she's a tramp.<br/><br/><i>Ace in the Hole</i>: the entry to the "Indian Ruins" starts off free, but as the crowds start to swell to find out what happens to the trapped miner, the entrance fee raises to .25, and then .50 and finally to 1.00.  It's indicative of the way people in the story are taking advantage of the misfortune of one man.<br/><br/>You may think I'm crazy, but I'm looking for ways to push these types of reoccurring thematic events during storytelling/gameplay.<br/><br/>A few games do this.  Dogs has traits that get defined during play and reused.  SotC has aspects that can be defined during play and reused.<br/><br/>So perhaps "subtlety" wasn't a great word.

When Veronica had several scenes where she clumsily fell down, it became a bit of theme.  A little comedy, no doubt, but it really had nothing to do with the rules of the game.  But she got her own in the end when she literally fall into the arms of the handsome deputy.  And we were all rooting for her at that point.  We all saw it and we were all working it.

I was thinking of actually writing down traits or events that happened on the character/situation cards during play and then allowing them to be reused in later scenes if they could be narrated in.  I realize that you lose the spontaneity, but in exchange you may gain a sense of reoccurring story elements. <br/><br/>I'm playing around with a plotting device I read in John Gardner's 'The Act of Fiction'.  To use your example, if you've smoked a cig when confronting a parental figure, maybe having that character smoke a cig later will bring up the same theme of the parental figure around the table.  Or maybe confronting a parental figure will have the character looking for a smoke.  Obviously the more it is used the more powerful (or lame) it can become.<br/><br/>I realize that this is a lot more about storytelling than role-playing, but that's the direction I'm trying to go in.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94874/#Comment_94874" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T17:20:05+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  5:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Remi was working on Young Adult RPG in Game Chef, he wanted to use the improv principle of reincorporation. But there's a saying that goes with it. Something like, "Once, Twice, Thrice--then out." The second time something comes up, it becomes a theme, the third time, it's complete. After that it is not funny or interesting anymore. <br/><br/>He or someone suggested giving a bonus the second time something was brought into play, then a bigger bonus for the third time--then dropping it after that. No more bonus. <br/><br/>It sounds like you want to tie simple elements to themes in play. In one PtA game, there was a photograph of my character's dead wife in his lab over his desk. It was sitting near a bottle containing a demon he'd caught.  Later in the game when it came into question as to whether the demon had killed the wife, or perhaps <i>was</i> the wife, that picture gained more intense meaning.  <br/><br/>Also, traits in Breaking the Ice often come to gain more weight over time as you get to know the characters. And crossing things off in Shooting the Moon, can be hard core.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94883/#Comment_94883" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T18:02:37+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  6:02PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was looking at some back conversations on S-G and found <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4203" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> that Matthijs started a few days ago.

So the Level 2 characters, who all envy each other, are doing all this subtle stuff to each other by way of their Level 3 characters, because it's the only means they have.  But really, the Players may be subtly digging at each other, too.  And it can get even worse/better, when the Level 3 characters start disguising themselves as other people...<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not explaining myself well, but check out 1,001 Nights.  It's an awesome game that doesn't get enough attention, IMHO.<br/><br/>Schizonauts I can't even begin to explain, as I don't have a copy of the rules text and only played it once (1,001 Nights I've played twice, and own, and want to play more of).  But basically it's this game where you each Player has two Characters, only they might really be the same person, or different facets of the same person, but even the Player doesn't know...<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95065/#Comment_95065" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:45:55+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, thanks for bringing these up.  I've always liked 1001 Nights and really enjoy playing it.  I have found that there is so much to keep track of in that game (storytelling, plot points, senses, rivalries) that it can get a bit overwhelming during play.  But Meg did a really nice job of adding in simple elements that add a lot to the collaborative storytelling.  I'm going to re-read that game again.<br/><br/>I remember Schizonauts from Game Chef, but to be honest I was so deep in my game that I didn't get a chance to read it.  But I will definitely check it out.<br/><br/>Emily, thanks for mentioning Remi's game because I didn't get to look at that one either!  And I have to say that reading Breaking the Ice was one of the things that propelled me into wanting to create a relationship/story-element map of some sort for The Naked City.<br/><br/>Ok, enough love.  Back to mechanics.  I added a section in the latest draft that encourages the players to take notes about the little elements in the game, and rewards them with a Noir Token for reincorporating an element that was not originally theirs into a later scene.  Hopefully this will give something else for players who are not controlling a character in a particular scene to keep an eye out for.  I'm really wanting to see suggestions from the "peanut gallery" to move the story in unexpected ways.  Since the players are not invested in individual characters, it will be interesting to see if that happens more or less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
