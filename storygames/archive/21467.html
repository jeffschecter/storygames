The kind where I can go after having been away for three years, or when exploring the scene for the first time, and discover the important games, the new games, whatever I need.<br/><br/>The main way for something of this sort to positively distinguish itself from RPG Geek would be by being compact and consistent: whatever its defined purview, it should cover it well, and be up to date, and be compiled by an expert of the field. A quick, sharp, opinionated source of knowledge. One can always link to e.g. RPG Geek to tap that sort of big data, but RPG Geek does not understand its subject matter.<br/><br/>The one thing I'm not so fond of in the above idea is that if you pulled off something that I was happy with, then I would be sad about it being entirely arbitrarily limited to GMless games [grin]. As you know, I don't hold that distinction as very meaningful myself.<br/><br/>With that in mind, perhaps the even better thing for your GMless site to be, from my perspective, would be as a repository of a sharp, true and constrained theoretical overview on the constraints, advantages and design patterns of GMless games. That would constrain the contents of the site to what is actually meaningful in the concept. A designer blog would be a fit format in this regard - something that I think I've suggested before.<br/><br/>Brainstorming even further: for you GMlessness is clearly an important thing. Perhaps even the matter of a school of design and theory. Maybe the site should be the anchor for that? A neat manifesto, blog to document developments in the field as they occur, some articles on the precepts of the school...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469820/#Comment_469820" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T17:01:33+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  5:01PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello, I wish for <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/>nice looking diagrams to exchange about game procedures and how to share GM tasks.

Maybe it only works in English for lists of games created by an author, like "bibliography" is often a list of books by an author (as opposed to study of books in general).<br/><br/>For those who haven't heard my disclaimer: I'm not really so much an insecure elitist trying to use difficult language to seem smart, rather than a non-native who's learned English from reading widely. I end up making all sorts of weird word choices when writing casually. As you might imagine, a non-native who learns their English from <i>Dracula</i> and academic stuff doesn't really have the same instinctual sense of social coding that you get with your first language, which then leads to weird fascination with the wrong words.<br/><br/>(My Finnish voice is less random - I suppose I sound sort of like Ralph Waldo Emerson or somebody like that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469865/#Comment_469865" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T20:46:06+00:00" title="February  9, 2018  8:46PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm super stoked that you are doing this. <br/>I agree with the input you've received above, which although expressed variously seems to mostly be in agreement.  <br/><br/>I'll bet you'd be able to get great analysis and content from some of the most committed and productive designers of gmLess games.

The site will also have content and subject matter on games with Decreased GM (e.g. PbtA games) narrative authority, but not to the same extent. The only criteria that must be met for a game\u2019s inclusion on the site is that it offers the players, as a whole, some resonable degree of authority to contribute to, and shape, the story\u2019s narrative outside of playing their character. The one area of expertise in which I consider myself qualified to discuss RPGs in significant depth is in the GMless space. <br/><br/>I do see a distinction between purely GMless, Collaborative Storytelling Games (e.g. Fall of Magic) and traditionally bifurcated GM/Player games; especially in regards to the games I\u2019m most interested in. The distinction is not a hard line, it is more like the opposite poles of a continuum with many outliers along the spectrum, but I feel it can be a useful way to conceptualize important differences between the modalities.<br/><br/>I feel that there is much more unexplored territory, untapped potential, and innovation  available in the GMless design space and praxis based theory. It is absolutely the ripest area for exploration, innovation\u2014and dare I say\u2014improvement.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>...perhaps the even better thing for your GMless site to be, from my perspective, would be as a repository of a sharp, true and constrained theoretical overview on the constraints, advantages and design patterns of GMless games...<br/>Perhaps even the matter of a school of design and theory. Maybe the site should be the anchor for that? A neat manifesto, blog to document developments in the field as they occur, some articles on the precepts of the school...</p></div></blockquote>\nThis will absolutely be part of the site; however, there will be absolutely zero theory for theory\u2019s sake. The only theory addressed will be that relevant design, praxis and play. Design is primarily, theory would only exist to the extent that it would help with design, the analysis of design, play, and so forth.<br/><br/>I would love to here any additional feedback or suggestions you have.

In case you were wondering why I hold so dinstinct ideas.)<br/><br/>All of the things you mention are fine things to put into a database like this. I think that these are the most important considerations:<br/><b>*</b> The format (what goes into each database entry) needs to be realistic in scope. By this I mean, it's much more favorable to say only the most important things about each game, and actually manage to create a comprehensive database, than to write extensively about a single game, but fail to finish the database because of the workload.<br/><b>*</b> The database needs to be interesting to read for a wide variety of people interested in the topic. This is best achieved by knowing the topic, saying penetrating things about individual games (not shying away from the business for fear of controversy, is my point), allowing people to search for content pertinent to their current interests, and generally thinking about the audience and their needs when designing the database.<br/><br/><b>A small foray into how to rate stuff well</b><br/><br/>I would figure out a harsh critical rating scheme (possibly several if necessary) that strives towards truth and provides useful information about different games, coming from a place of deep expertise. (That last point means: don't review if you cannot say something non-obvious.) Basically like the star ratings that movie review scenes and such obsess over, but distilled and designed down into a sharp instrument for succinctly expressing the true nature of things.<br/><br/>As a concrete example of what I mean, I created such a ratings scheme for old school D&amp;D adventures several years back. (I intended to publish some reviews in my blog, just never got around to it before I stopped blogging.) My scheme awarded "stars" as follows:<br/><br/><b>Solid craft:</b> You could get a "craft" star for the adventure being well-crafted according to my own overall conception of what that entails for old school adventure modules. A binary choice, and a clear one for me, as I have rather clear and strident norms for what's acceptable and what's not in this type of product.<br/><br/><b>Inspiring ideas:</b> You could get a "literary" star for the adventure having literary merit or other exceptional ideas. This is a binary choice, with the threshold being pretty much whether the adventure tries to (and succeeds in) inspire with originality.<br/><br/><b>Flawed details:</b> You could get a "details" skull if the adventure is otherwise usable, but includes repairable flaws in important places where they cannot be ignored. This is generally caused by differing procedural standards for what "old school D&amp;D" entails, so that the author has intentionally created something that I disagree with; for example, I consider set-piece encounters to be flawed detail, as well as conspicuously lacking stats for stuff (monsters, treasure, etc.) that is clearly potentially in play in the scenario.<br/><br/><b>Bad Craft:</b> You could get a "craft" skull for the scenario being overall sloppily made and not up to the standards of design that I expect of D&amp;D adventure modules intended for other people's use.<br/><br/>As you can see, the system I conceived for critical review of old school D&amp;D adventures is sort of like a stars rating system in that if you want to, you can total up the stars and skulls (presumably deduct the latter from the former) to end up with a score from -2 to +2 (or 1-5 if you want). However, as you can hopefully see, the system is also very strict and kinda-sorta objective (I'm not really interested in engaging <i>that</i> philosophical issue here), and you could conceivably draw much useful fundamental information about the given adventure module by simply checking its "marks".<br/><br/>Hmm, I should go ahead with this adventure review project. Good stuff, and I know I'd find it useful myself if I could just check some resource to find out which of the e.g. XRP Advanced Adventures modules feature technical flaws and which don't. That's just not something that they write in their adventure module descriptions, obviously [grin].<br/><br/>Aside from the issue of how to rate reviews, you might find it interesting to know what things I chose to include in my "review format" for D&amp;D adventures - it's sort of a similar case as yours in that I wanted a succinct format that would enable me to process a large number of entries quickly, while providing the benefit of my expertise (and work in reading all these adventures; I've read quite a few) to the readers without breaking myself with work. I wanted something where a single entry would be so short they could be displayed on a web page as a list, rather than giving each their own page. Here's what I ended up with:<br/><b>Basic metadata:</b> Author, publisher, publication year, format (page count)<br/><b>Marks:</b> Stars and skulls, as described above.<br/><b>Tags:</b> A bunch of tags for indicating certain high-order concerns about D&amp;D adventures. These include the likes of "it's a dungeon crawl / hex crawl", "it's low/mid/high level", "it's D&amp;D / historical / asian / fairy tale / gonzo in literary genre", and so on. Things you want to know when picking what adventure modules to consider for your campaign.<br/><b>Cover art</b><br/><b>Verbal review:</b> One paragraph long, strict. Not only do I find a longer one unnecessary for critical review of D&amp;D adventures, but there are other people who like writing reviews in the sense of "long description of the contents".<br/><b>Review links:</b> A few good in-depth descriptive reviews of the module, if available.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the kind of thing that I'd find interesting in other sorts of game databases: critical review and categorization. In the case of GMless games, perhaps recognize and categorize things like creative agendas, whether they're one-shot or multi-session, whether they require genre expertise from the players, whether the game has obvious flaws, what it is good for... all sorts of useful things to note once you start thinking in terms of expressing things that other people might find useful to know.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
