(Someone write this up, here in this thread!)<br/><br/>From the BBC exclusive, a few quotes:<br/>\n<blockquote>\u201cThere are thousands of people doing this in just the US alone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fad,\u201d says Browning.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/> \u201cFrom what we can tell, most major cities across the world seem to have a vampire community,\u201d says Williams.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>\u201cThis was the late 2000s and they weren\u2019t even watching True Blood!\u201d he says with disbelief.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>\u201cVampires aren't always skulking around graveyards, attending goth nightclubs, or feasting at blood orgies,\u201d explains one vampire named \u201cMerticus\u201d.  \u201cThere are real vampire organisations who feed the homeless, volunteer in animal rescue groups, and who take up any number of social causes.\u201d <br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Whatever the precise nature of the donor-vampire relationship, it\u2019s always consensual. \u201cThe utmost care is taken of the donor \u2013 making sure they are relaxed and willing at all times,\u201d says Kinesia.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Unfortunately, most vampires are too afraid of the stigma to tell doctors or social workers of their habit. \u201cWe had one person say that if a clinician found out I was a vampire, they\u2019d take my kids away,\u201d says Williams, who has studied the possible effects the stigma may have on the vampires' healthcare.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Certainly, Browning and Williams both say that through their extensive contact with these people, they saw no evidence of psychiatric difficulties. Joseph Laycock at Texas State University, who has also studied vampire identity, agrees: \u201cThey had different premises but they thought about it logically \u2013 they proceed logically from the need to drink blood.\u201d<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>In the meantime, a group of vampires, led by Kinesia, are taking the first steps themselves. Using commercial companies such as 23andme and uBiome, for instance, she is starting to profile the genes and microbiomes of other med sangs.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to them is real. We don\u2019t understand what it is, and they don\u2019t understand what it is \u2013 but they are doing their best to deal with it.\u201d<br/></blockquote>\n<br/>Not only interesting, but ripe for a game designer to pluck.
