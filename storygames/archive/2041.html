                    Yesterday I ran a new episode of my ongoing <i><a href="http://www.tlucretius.net/TopTen/index.html" rel="nofollow">"Top 10"</a></i> campaign.  The game is based on Alan Moore and and Gene Ha's comic, which features a police procedural in a city inhabited primarily by super heroes (or rather "science heroes").  I'm currently using the <i>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</i> (2nd ed.) system, although if I was starting it today I would likely use <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i>.  I have six players, including my husband; it's a very friendly, relaxed group and we enjoy the social aspect as much as the game part.  There's three more "hardcore" gamers (including my husband and myself) two self-described social gamers and two middling players.  <br/><br/>I had a thread of plot going: the team was working on a few cases, most prominently following up on the death of a former nazi war criminal who had been a big player in the local drug market; and investigating a series of thefts of powers rings, arcane items and registered devices.  The players had chosen to look for the underground lair that the old nazis were known to have built under the city of Neopolis.  I hap an idea what NPCs these plots involved, and what they were doing in the mean time, but I really didn't care which way the PCs came at the story; I had no interest in making them roll to find a specific secret passage or what have you.  <br/><br/>Since the three of us who are most interested in gaming-for-game's-sake have been playing other games as well, exploring a number of story games (Burning Empires, Capes, Dogs in the Vineyard, octaNe, Primetime Adventures, Universalis, etc.), I thought this group might be interested in bringing in more story gaming and more shared control.  I told the group I'd like to try this, and explained they could create the story by deciding what would make for the coolest scenes and adventure.  <br/><br/>They had already met with an old science hero who had sketched a map of the tunnels for them; they new some entrances were in the sewers, others were under buildings that had been demolished and rebuilt, etc.  What would make the story fun for them -- would it be to discover the old nazis' connections to a shiny new hi-tech corporation?  A grungy gang in an old warehouse?  Crocodile-men in the sewers?<br/><br/>They immediately took to this.  They decided that the investigation should lead to the Bavarian Wagnerian Church and its Albert Speer-inspired temple.  They created decoy locations, hidden caches, etc.  Interestingly, one of the self-described "social gamers" was one of the most enthusiastic about this approach (perhaps not surprising given her ambition to write an publish a novel.)  <br/><br/>A fun bit was a player creating complications for his own character.  He plays a noir detective somewhat inspired by The Spectre, Johnny Mortis.  Mortis is very hard to hurt but has essentially no offensive capabilities, has some post-cognition abilities, and can travel astrally.  Mortis, in astral/ghostly form, was scaring off a bunch of skinheads who had come to the priest's rescue.  At the end of the fight, Mortis's slumped body had disappeared in the scuffle.  I only intended a bit of annoyance and slowing him down, probably giving the character some clues at the same time.  But the player took to this (he's the third "hardcore" gamer in the group.)  <br/><br/>The rules say that he can only get about 1,000 feet away from his body, but do not specify what happens.  I was expecting that he would simply decide that his spirit snapped back to the body and he'd wake up.  But the player decided that his character was not held together very well, and that getting away further than 1,000 feet meant he couldn't find his body anymore.  He suggested that perhaps someone or something else might even take control of the body, use his connections and identity, and create a mess for Johnny Mortis!  <br/><br/>We're still getting the hang of this approach for a game not exactly built to support it (though M&amp;M at least offers <i>some</i> support for player creative control), but I found it great fun.  I'm going to try this as often as I can.  :-)                </div>

                            That sounds like a really fun game - I love Top 10! Will you be trying it again with M&amp;M, or trying out a different system? I think with the will there, M&amp;M can easily be tailored to handle player control.<br/><br/>It also sounds like a similar experience I had recently in my Cthulhu: Miami Vice game with my brother and his non-gamer housemates. Midway through an investigation we went "off the map", largely pushing aside the written plot and BRP rules for a more narrativist approach, with the players narrating what they found with successful skill checks.                        </div>

                            I'm definitely going to continuing trying to share story development in M&amp;M Top 10, since it's an ongoing campaign.  For other future campaigns or series, I will probably stick to lighter systems like Over The Edge or PDQ, which I think make it easier to concentrate on story.  (I keep thinking <i>Dead Inside</i>/PDQ would be great to run <i>Lost</i> or <i>Fell</i> as story games.)<br/><br/>Cthulhu: Miami Vice?  That sounds like a great premise.  Any Actual Play notes available?  :-)                        </div>

Sadly no actual play. It was a good premise, but it wasn't as fun as the campaign that preceded it. We played a rather action-flicky campaign of Cthulhu: Vietnam earlier in the year, and had such a blast chewing up the scenery and the monsters that we thought we'd play a sequel set 10 years later with all the characters back in civilian life in Miami. It was sillier than it perhaps should have been, and whilst nice to revisit old characters lacked some of the charm (not to mention horrors) of the Vietnam game. <br/><br/>I agree though - Cthulhu + Miami + hard-boiled vice squad detectives should have been magical, so maybe I'll revisit it in the future!                         </div>

                            Dude, Sophie.  You are running my dream campaign.  Curse you!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I have been psyched to run an M&amp;M Top 10 game for about three years now.  Haven't been able to build the player will for it though.<br/>
<br/>
(Although I did run a successful, occasional, DC Elseworlds game set in the 1920s where the PCs were all "pulp" reimaginings of early DC characters.)<br/>
<br/>
Can you talk a little bit about the techniques you used to get StoryGame in your peanut butter?  I know that, depending on play style, M&amp;M can requiure some elaborate prep-work.  I mean, I can fully stat an NPC with 132 PP at PL 7, or I can just say he's Attack +9/Damage +5, Defense +8/D.Save +6 and wing his powers as +7's as I go.  When your players introduced all this material (crocodile men, ancient cults, etc) into your game, how did you handle the mechanical aspects?<br/>
<br/>
1) Just wing the numbers, as above?<br/>
2) Use stock/prebuilt NPC stats?<br/>
3) Gather player input in advance of the session and then stat stuff up before play begins?<br/>
4) Take a time out and ask everyone to sit down and help you stat out the baddies before the throwdown?  (Actually, with a slightly simpler system I think this would make an awesome mechanic for a game -- everyone builds supervillains and then the GM throws them at the group.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'd be curious to hear more detail about play and about how you actually deployed these techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Two other questions I have:<br/>
<br/>
A) How has the transition from SAS/Tri-Stat to M&amp;M2 gone?  Any thoughts or observations on how it's changed the tone of the game?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> What uses for Hero Points are you seeing most often from your players?  Do they use them for "editing" or do you mainly handle that stuff at the social level?  And what do you give players Hero Points for?  Complications and sub-plots?  "Good roleplaying"?  Just being defeated?  Explicitly as "sugar" to help the GM-railroading-pill go down?<br/>
<br/>
Curious about all this,<br/>
<br/>
Robert.                        </div>
