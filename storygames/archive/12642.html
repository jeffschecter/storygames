(OK, standard Cortex can do that, too.)<br/><br/>There is a pool of Trouble dice that the GM rolls whenever the conflict is with something that isn't statted out like an NPC; again a <b>Dogs</b>-like feature.  <br/><br/>The metacurrency (Plot Points) are often earned when a player <i>chooses</i> to make trouble for his character, or <i>chooses</i> to have his character fail in an in-character way.  Rather like a <b>Full Light, Full Steam</b> Thematic Battery recharge...<br/><br/>The GM adventure creation instructions <i>start</i> with how to find places to drive Wedges between Leads and their Relationships, and goes on from there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Indie FTW!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283893/#Comment_283893" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T07:35:14+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  7:35AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2010 7:35AM by Matthijs.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shit, another game I want to buy.

We all knew that Clark and Lana would never stay together for long, because Clark and Lois were destined to be together. We also always knew that Clark and Lex's friendship could never last, because Clark and Lex were destined to be eternal nemeses. The great thing with doing an RPG of it is you could throw in a what if and do Clark + Lana or Clark + Chloe, or an alternate world where Clark shares his secret with Lex and Lex becomes a faithful ally and Oliver Queen due to his relationship with Lex in school ends up becoming the evil nemesis.<br/><br/>Most other licensed settings aren't really that appealing given the canon usually is around defeating the greatest evil, so there isn't much point in doing an RPG set in it (like, you could always do an RPG set in Spira where the point is to defeat Sin and die as the summoner, but we all know that Tidus and Yuna finally beat Sin for good).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284047/#Comment_284047" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T16:48:27+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  4:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>:  The very first comment I made upon seeing the Smallville RPG was "It's medium-crunch PTA -- with superpowers!"  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284049/#Comment_284049" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T16:50:48+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  4:50PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DainXB</cite><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>: The very first comment I made upon seeing the Smallville RPG was "It's medium-crunch PTA -- with superpowers!" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nDamn, you sold me.

I think it surprises people that I'm that kind of designer; I got into the industry writing and developing Dragonlance material for d20 after all, and classic Cortex (circa Serenity) owes a great deal to Unisystem, Alternity, and Deadlands/Savage Worlds. But I love the risk-taking play that comes out of the "indie" scene and I have been sneaking bits and pieces of it into my design since I started.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut while Josh and I did assemble some nifty ideas in the conceptual stage, I think SMALLVILLE really hit the ground running once it went into alpha playtest with multiple groups. We dropped Attributes and Skills because of playtest feedback, and I think a lot of the cool systems in the game arose as a response to playtesters asking for something to handle X or be more like Y.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284180/#Comment_284180" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T13:48:44+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  1:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 1:55PM by Silverlion.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if it would work for my Medical Space Station setting inspired by Sector General.

I mean in the comics (until recently at least) Lex didn't know Clark until metropolis and he didn\xe8t run into half of his Smallville villians until he put on the suit.  So where after show ends we know that in general terms Clark will be the Superman from the comics, its not going to be the 100% canon DC comics that we know.<br/><br/>So in the RPG, that leaves me so much wiggle-room its not funny.  For instance one of my players is running Hal Jordan.  Immediately I stipulated that it was Alan Scott's ring (which was introduced as scenery in a recent season episode).  I haven't mapped out the history of the ring but I know I will not be getting into the whole Oan-Starheart continuity retcon that mainline comics has gotten into.  It will be relatively close to the current origins for Hal's ring but taking a whole lot of liberty with the time-frames.<br/><br/>But that is okay.  As long as Hal becomes the Green Lantern at the end of my campaign, I feel that I have kept with the spirit of the show - and for me that is what counts.<br/><br/>Smallville came at the perfect time - I was pretty done with conventional RPGs (my recent Shadowrun campaign was so painful to run) and discovering Houses of the Blooded and (now) Smallville was just the medicine I needed.  I think I might be done with conventional RPGs, at least for the near future...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284308/#Comment_284308" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T12:07:21+00:00" title="August  4, 2010 12:07PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You had me at "sort of out-PTAs PTA".

It sounds like it should be right up my alley (superheroes AND teensploitation angst? please and thank you!) but it is always just so damn BAD that I can't ignore the bad even when there are 17th century French witches reincarnated into Korean girls who do kung fu against Superboy. Still, this RPG has me VERY interested and a thing sprung fully formed into my mind at 4am that Smallille the RPG was made to do. Sadly, only like one other guy in my game group would get any of it so this is kind of a heartbreaker as well. What do you guys think?<br/><br/>After childhood, elementary school, and middle school, high school is like a fourth world.<br/><br/>Things are going pretty well for Hunter O\u2019Ryan. Because he\u2019s made strides with his anger management and depression issues, Hunter was accepted to the New Beginnings Charter School. He already has a new best friend in Ray Lucent, a happy and bright counterpoint to his brooding nature, a love interest in Maya, head of the drama club called the Forever People, and he\u2019s backup quarterback for the New Beginnings War Dogs. Unfortunately, because of his previous issues, Hunter has drawn special attention from the principle, Isaiah Pater, and the guidance counselor, Madonna Bocks. They seem to mean well and only want the best for him even if they seem bent on ruining him socially with their anger management exercises. Despite that, things are looking pretty good.<br/><br/>Then, completely out of the blue, demonic creatures with laser guns and jet packs attack Hunter and Ray. They believe themselves done for until they both develop strange abilities that help them survive the attack. Resolving to keep the powers a secret for the moment, Hunter and Ray begin to suspect that Mr. Pater and Mrs. Bocks know way more about what\u2019s going on at New Beginnings than they\u2019re letting on. Things keep getting weirder.<br/><br/>Then a kid named Scott Free transfers from, although he keeps saying \u201cescaped from,\u201d Mageddo High in the next town over. He seems to know more about the weirdness than Hunter or Ray, but won\u2019t come clean with everything until he feels he can trust them. So far, Scott only drops cryptic hints about Mr. Uxas, principle at Mageddo, and his bizarre fascination with theoretical mathematics and the end of the world. Worse than that, Scott seems even more worried about what will happen when \u201cBarda catches up with me.\u201d<br/><br/>Hunter expected sophomore year to be tough, but he didn\u2019t expect an apocalypse!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284442/#Comment_284442" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:29:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I lolled.
