In general, it was pretty well-received.<br/><br/>I've had a lot of requests to expand the universe, add various things over the 3 years since I initially started running the games... and now, I am finally able to do that, thanks to Kickstarter.<br/><br/>On this Kickstarter, I'm offering every expansion we unlock to every backer for FREE, after the first 3. I think that's a pretty good deal...<br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/era-the-consortium-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/era-the-consortium-expansions</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
