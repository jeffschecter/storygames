I'm relatively new to these forums \u2013 a fellow game design friend recommended them. Anyway, I'm recruiting play testers for an RPG I've been developing. I already posted this to rpggeek, but figured this would be a good place to go as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm Dustin DePenning, a designer of (sometimes lackluster) children's games. While it's very fun and pays the bills, my passion is in high quality RPGs. Working closely with Rob Daviau, Craig Van Ness, and a few others has taught me some things that I could use in this field.<br/><br/>I've been cooking up a sci-fi RPG for a long time now and want to kickstart it soon. I need play testers willing to work with rough word documents.<br/><br/><b>So What's the game?</b><br/>It's called Synthicide. <br/><br/><b>What's it about?</b><br/>Don't want to spill all the IP beans here, but it takes place in a decaying galaxy where cybernetic priests and synthetic beings are the upper caste. Common humans and mutant dregs aren't worth very much.<br/><br/><b>What are the dominant themes?</b><br/>The game focuses on a resource inversion. It's sad, but bullets are more common than food. The players are sharpers: drifting no gooders who are trying to scrape by in an oppressive society.<br/><br/><b>What system does the game use?</b><br/>It uses an entirely custom 1d10 system that is comparable in feel to D&amp;D and Pathfinder, yet much simpler. Currently I am focused on developing automated improvisation tools for the GM. This will make the game even easier. In final production these tools will be delivered as form enabled PDFs that work on any system that supports Adobe Reader.<br/><br/><b>What's in it for me?</b><br/>Well, the love of the game for starters. Play tester credits and a free copy of the printed book too! And maybe we'll become friends. That could be cool, right?<br/><br/><b>What's expected of me?</b><br/>Sign a simple NDA that keeps you from posting any of the book's content or transferring the digital files, and then you're off! The NDA does not bar you from discussing the game with others, or even posting bits of its rules for analysis. It's just intended to maintain that my game is not creative commons and that I retain ownership of it. After signing the NDA, I just want your honest feedback as you and your friends wrap your head around the game.<br/><br/><b>What to do next</b><br/>Message me with any questions or concerns if you're interested. Send me your email address too if you're ready to jump on board right now! Hope to hear from you all soon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435292/#Comment_435292" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T03:41:10+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  3:41AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The premise sounds interesting. Would you say that your game is predicated on a GM's story wherein he shows us how the galaxy is, or the challenge of surviving and prospering in a merciless galaxy? The answer could be "neither", of course - those are just the two angles that occurred to me first. It might help in considering the question if you think about your GMing framework: does the game rely on plotted scenarios the GM devices, or is it more of a player-directed sandbox, to illustrate a couple of common models.\n<blockquote>Sign a simple NDA that keeps you from posting any of the book's content or transferring the digital files, and then you're off! The NDA does not bar you from discussing the game with others, or even posting bits of its rules for analysis. It's just intended to maintain that my game is not creative commons and that I retain ownership of it. After signing the NDA, I just want your honest feedback as you and your friends wrap your head around the game.</blockquote>\nNot that it's any of my business, but just in case somebody out there stumbles on this thread looking for best practices, I'll note that this procedure is not necessary for copyright purposes in a situation like this - your copyright is not endangered by lack of NDA in playtesting procedures, and it is not fortified by NDAs, either. From the viewpoint of trademark or trade secret practice a NDA could <i>theoretically</i> be relevant for a rpg developer, but the practical odds are so low - particularly for a small press developer - that it's almost a certainty that the NDA hurts more than it helps. It's not a procedure I'd recommend for a small press rpg developer who is at all concerned about the threshold of participation in his project, as it is very likely to lose him interest and participation without providing any real advantage.<br/><br/>(I should clarify that this is not some sort of backwards way of saying that I'd playtest were it not for the NDA - I don't have time for a new playtest project in my schedule right now, so I don't need to see the game to decide on that. For others it might be an issue, though; I at least can't imagine mustering more than some idle curiousity towards a game without reviewing the text first, so I couldn't possibly make any decisions about wanting to playtest based on a superficial description only.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435295/#Comment_435295" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T05:22:20+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  5:22AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Eero said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435301/#Comment_435301" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T08:13:49+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  8:13AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2014 8:39AM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thirding what Eero said.

My kick starter campaign will include none such language :P<br/><br/>I understand that NDAs can be a turn off.

Again I don't want to gag people or restrict conversation about my game. I don't want people afraid that I'll consider any idepedent or concurrent ideas as my property.  I just want to get a written promise that my actual files won't be shared digitally with anyone I haven't been in contact with. This limits the scopes of players, but I'm ok with that. <br/><br/>To those of you who want to know more/see more before agreeing to playtest, that's no problem.

Got some time tonight to give you more info. Here's the basics of the game:<br/><br/><b>GENERAL GAME RULES</b><br/>The game uses a custom system revolving around 7 stats: Awareness, Combat, Toughness, Influence, Operation, Nerve, and Speed (ACTIONS)<br/><br/>Every time a character attempts an important or dramatic action, roll the d10. Add the relevant attribute (e.g. Awareness to spot a hidden enemy).<br/><br/>The GM decides a target number based upon how difficult the situation seems. This number is called the Action Difficulty. If you roll above the Action Difficulty, you succeed. If you succeeded in excess (5 above, 10 above, etc.), then the GM may reward you with more advantages.<br/><br/><b>CREATING CHARACTERS</b><br/>There are no character classes. However, all characters have an "Aspect" that lets them acquire some abilities more easily than others. Your Aspect also determines what starting abilities you can choose.<br/><br/>Characters generate their beginning stats by choosing a body type and a mind type. The can choose between an organic body and a plugged body (cybernetic), and an organic mind or a plugged mind. Then they choose a Favored stat (+2), Good stat (+1), and poor stat (-2) for final customization.<br/><br/><b>SKILLS</b><br/>There are no real skills in the game, only Knowledge Powers. Your Operation Attribute is used whenever you attempt something requiring technical knowledge. The GM will severely limit your options and abilities on what you can do off a raw Operation roll. However, taking Knowledge Powers guarantees you actions you can take by rolling Operation (hacking a computer, trauma surgery, etc.).<br/><br/><b>SPACE TRAVEL AND TRADING</b><br/>There are some very basic rules to handle space travel and trading. Corporations and the Church have most trade locked down, so there's not much money to be made here. Most money that Shaprers can earn comes from theft, smuggling, or dirty work.<br/><br/><b>STARVATION</b><br/>Your characters are always 6 days away from starving. The food in the galaxy is crappy, a lot of people are sick, and no matter how much you eat you aren't really sustained. This means keeping track of food and eating is important.<br/><br/><b>BATTLE SYSTEM</b><br/>Battle rules are roughly 50% of the actual system. The miniature combat focus is what can make it similar to D&amp;D and Pathfinder. It uses the classics of:<br/><br/>Battle takes place on a square grid.<br/>Characters may have proficiencies that make them better with certain weapons.<br/>Characters may have abilities that make them more lethal in combat or good at shutting enemies down.<br/>Characters have varying amounts of HP based upon their level and body type, and any abilities they chose.<br/><br/>What's different:<br/>There's no Base attack bonus or +1/2 level stuff. Your Combat Attribute describes how good you are at hurting people, and its up to you to invest in it.<br/>Attack and Damage are determined by a single roll of the d10. You add your ATT to see if you hit, and if you hit, you add your DMG to the same result to see how much damage you deal.<br/>There's a combat action called "Gain Advantage." Essentially, you describe a short series of actions or an aspect of the battle that you believe gives you an edge over your enemy. You then request a specific bonus (extra ATT, cause an enemy to lose their turn, etc.). The GM may require an Attribute roll. If you succeed you gain the desired bonus.<br/>Battles tend to be fast \u2013 and people die a lot.<br/>Death isn't very permanent. If you have the money and get the body to a doctor fast enough, characters can be revived. You also have to have unspent RESOLVE points, but I won't explain what those are just yet.<br/><br/><b>GM STUFF</b><br/>The game focuses on extemporaneous improvisation. The GM is encouraged to use an automated tool to build a few NPCs/enemies, make a rough outline for two stories/missions, then start the session. The players ultimately choose where they want to go and what they want to do, but hopefully the two options the GM provides have attractive stories.<br/><br/>If the players do something completely unexpected, the GM is encouraged to repurpose the original NPCs by re-theming them to match the direction of the session, as well as use the automated tool to quickly make a few more NPCs if necessary.<br/><br/>The GM is also encouraged to only "plan one session ahead." He should weave a long-term story based upon player decisions and story consequences, not a preplanned epic story.<br/><br/><b>STUFF TO COME</b><br/>I need to finish my html trap generator<br/>I'm working with a writer friend to add more richness/depth to the universe<br/>I'm going to create some "plot twist" rules to allow the game to surprise the GM. Basically, when the players have resounding successes or resounding failures, the GM rolls on a relevant plot twist table. He interprets the text and then decides how it affects the current situation. This can turn the tides of a social encounter or battle, surprising everyone playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435359/#Comment_435359" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T21:15:29+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  9:15PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, some more info on the story of the game:<br/><b><br/>UNIVERSE BACKGROUND</b><br/>Synthicide\u2019s characters live in a galaxy fighting social and economic collapse. It is our<br/>own galaxy, but many millennia in the future, with Earth and its nations long forgotten.<br/>There are only two known intelligences in the galaxy \u2013 humans and their synthetic<br/>creations. Misguided humans have elevated these robots, originally mankind\u2019s servants,<br/>to a position as masters.<br/>An evil mutant force called the Prodigravus attempted to absorb or wipe out all of<br/>humanity. A millennium long gene war ensued. Ending the war required destroying<br/>almost every civilized planet in the galaxy and left the stars full of cratered worlds and<br/>dangerous mutants. Humanity descended into a dark age, and almost never returned.<br/>A tech cult called the Tharnaxist Church had managed to retain some<br/>technological knowledge and used it to exploit the weak position of the galaxy. They<br/>grew their power over the surviving humans and mutants, doling out simple technology<br/>to keep the people in line. However, Tharnaxist Priests weren\u2019t focused on the livelihood<br/>of organics. They only cared about discovering more technology and building synthetic<br/>beings to run their society. As a result, the highest crime on any planet became<br/>Synthicide. If one murders a robot and gets caught, they earn the ire of the Church.<br/>With human life devalued, social structures descended into barbarism, extortion,<br/>and gang-rule. People began to live in constant fear of synthetics, especially those in<br/>service of the Church. And with each planet violent and barely hospitable, anyone with<br/>the means became sharpers, flying through space from world to world. Life adrift as a no<br/>gooder is preferable to the Tharnaxist hellholes where one has to refuel. It\u2019s a sad,<br/>upside-down galaxy. Bullets are more common than food, and one of the best ways to<br/>keep your belly full.<br/><b>About Synthetics (Robots)</b><br/>Synthetics are free entities to do as they please. They construction is commissioned by<br/>the Church or powerful corporations, but must be paid and are released after an initial<br/>contract. Most take to wandering the galaxy, and a few fall in permanently with the<br/>Church. Robots are effectively immortal, so they go through seasons of boredom and<br/>personality shift. A robot may spend 100 years as a laborer, only to suddenly decide it<br/>would be interested to become a bounty hunter. Robots view humans either as an friendly<br/>oddity or pond scum.<br/><b>About the Church</b><br/>Tharnaxism worships a fabled tech god named Ranix. Its Church is full of cybernetically<br/>enhanced priests and robots that brutally enforce rule \u2013 only to make sure they are the<br/>most technologically advanced social structure. They allow trade and free travel of<br/>humans and mutants, but do very little to ensure that people have food, safety, or any real<br/>system of laws. They only take interest in punishing those who mistreat robots and<br/>priests.<br/><b>About Mutants</b><br/>Mutants are the genetic waste left from the Millennial war against the Prodigravus. Most<br/>people have no knowledge that this war happened, but still find mutants unsettling. While<br/>pure Prodigravus still exist in the galaxy, they are too insane and dangerous to cohabitate<br/>with others.

It's very open ended, and just helps you generate the crunchy numbers to fairly affect the players, but lets you do all the fun work of deciding what form the trap actually takes.<br/><br/>Also, had a meeting with my writer Nick Seibel, and we're about 50% complete on a plot twist engine to help Synthicide surprise both the players and the GM as well as move things forward. This will probably finish at the end of the month.<br/><br/>The idea behind the plot twist engine is that resounding success/failure should trigger an unusual event. The gm will roll on a chart (one for battles, one for story), and be provided a twist. Here's an example twist for story situations:<br/><br/><b>Effect</b><br/>An NPC is revealed to be something other than they claim to be.<br/><b>Example</b><br/>An NPC's accent slips, revealing that he is purposely disguising his speech.<br/><br/>So why are we making this? To increase drama for both the players as well as the GM. In traditional RPGs, the only drama/surprise a GM can experience is in his players outsmarting him to take the path of least resistance, or random dice results over-influencing the difficulty of a situation. So here's how Synthicide can be different:<br/><br/>1. The NPC generator and the Trap generator afford the GM more mechanical flexibility<br/>2. The game's story ethos focuses on less concrete preparation from the GM and more reaction to what the players do<br/>3. Utilizing this flexibility, we can allow the players and the GM to be surprised by his own game without derailing a session. No need to suddenly dig in source books to roll up characters, find new monsters, or stat out hazards.<br/>4. The result is that the GM still spins the story he wants based upon the players' past actions, AND he has  impetus/aids for immediate &amp; creative story revelations.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435451/#Comment_435451" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-17T21:36:55+00:00" title="July 17, 2014  9:36PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2014 9:45PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Noyce.</i><br/><br/>So I'm gonna ask you the same question I asked Catty - what do you think about making a google hangout and running a playtest for volunteer players assembled from here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Niko" title="Niko"><img alt="Niko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/nN2P8QVOIEP27.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Niko">Niko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435456/#Comment_435456" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-18T04:01:39+00:00" title="July 18, 2014  4:01AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, in the context of the playtest, are you planning on setting up some kind of shared space where the disparate groups can talk shop?

By virtue of writing the stuff down, you have established a defacto copyright.  So, someone can't just come along and steal it away from you, regardless of whether or not they transfer digital files.  If you are concerned about loosing your IP, then rather than try to enforce it with likely unenforceable NDAs (really?  Do you want to try to do a civil case in another country?), then you need to trademark the core components of your universe.  I'll be candid with you though -- what you've described here?  Sounds kinda like Warhammer 40K.  Mechanically?  Same... your twists are nothing more than hard moves from a PbtA game.<br/><br/>So, what I see is someone who is actively doing themselves a disservice by not really hearing what others are telling them.  Don't ignore the requests from a group of people who are willing to run through an adventure with you because you're too busy "developing".  Don't ignore people feeling uncomfortable with an NDA... Look, the RPG industry is positively brimming over with games for people to play -- each of the people you disenfranchise here may later say "oh, Synthecide?  Yeah, I kinda remember that... the guy didn't get it... not interested".  The fans you make now, because of the way you treat people, will stay with you through thick and thin.  But if you use this opportunity to push people away, who do you think is going to spread the word and generate excitement for your game later?  <br/><br/>Best of luck regardless of the path you follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435481/#Comment_435481" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-19T07:13:19+00:00" title="July 19, 2014  7:13AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure Dustin has already figured out that there are people out there for whom the NDA idea is peculiar. Surely we don't need to make this thread be about him chasing off a queue of people, all eager to correct his ways - after all, it is his right to limit access to his game however he wants, surely. Besides, pressuring others about business decisions is ethically questionable in that you're basically taking responsibility for the consequences; it'll be your fault if, instead of offering advice, you pressure someone into working your way, and that then blows in their face in whatever manner. Let the man make his own choices and take the responsibility for them, trying new things is the only way to progress. I'm pretty sure myself that Dustin's being spooked by shadows (really, Internet piracy of a rpg manuscript?), but if a NDA helps him sleep at night, then that's what he's gotta do.<br/><br/>Regarding the playtest question, I notice that you're already running an online playtest, Dustin, and you used that as a reason to brush away Tod's question about online testing. If you get more people interested in an online playtest campaign, how about you facilitate the campaign and then let it run on its own? What I mean is, you don't need to say that your schedule is full and thus you can't run another campaign, when you could simply make one of the interested playtesters the GM, participate in their first session maybe to make sure they've got it, and then let them go on their merry way.

I would say that the odds are in favour of getting more eyeballs and playtest hours out of online playtests than traditional, particularly if you bother to do a little bit of corresponding with all the playtesters, and make a quick appearance at the test yourself to make the testers feel appreciated and motivated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435486/#Comment_435486" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-19T13:42:36+00:00" title="July 19, 2014  1:42PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Regarding the playtest question, I notice that you're already running an online playtest, Dustin, and you used that as a reason to brush away Tod's question about online testing.

I'm all for people organizing online play tests, and I can step forward to help set them up initially. I was merely saying that I cannot be the GM for any other play tests. I will maintain email correspondence with all play testers (otherwise, what would the point be?).<br/><br/>I actually spent the past couple days trying to come up with a "best practices" for online play testing Synthicide. Here's what I came up with:<br/><br/>1. People should use google hangout, with the GM using the desktop sharing feature<br/>2. I created a simple play grid that supports adobe reader: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/35jjem0e08d2p0e/GameGrid.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/35jjem0e08d2p0e/GameGrid.pdf</a><br/>3. The GM uses textbox markup tools to create game objects, and the drawing markup tool to draw elements on the game grid<br/><br/>(there are many tools out there for playing games online, but I am unaware of any that are free. Above is a free solution I came up with. Do you guys know of any better ways)<br/><br/>I'll set up a thread for anyone who would want to play via google hangout.<br/><br/>I'm a little frustrated by the suggestion that I'm ignoring or not supporting people who want to play Synthicide. I'm sorry if some of you feel I'm trying to test my game in the wrong way, and I am sorry if you don't find my game ideas innovative or interesting. There's a difference between "refusing to listen" and choosing to focus on those interested in engaging Synthicide rather than whether or not I should have an NDA. <br/><br/>Those of you following who want to play \u2013 please directly say so! I've had a four direct requests for play testing, of which I'm very thankful and am supporting them with feedback and material.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Niko" title="Niko"><img alt="Niko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/nN2P8QVOIEP27.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Niko">Niko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435505/#Comment_435505" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-19T21:56:03+00:00" title="July 19, 2014  9:56PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Hi Niko \u2013 I'll try to be more involved when there isn't so much on my plate!

Again, I realize this can't really stop people from doing what they want, but the whole "sleep better at night" philosophy definitely applies here. I'll be completely transparent \u2013 having a promise from each person who gets docs just makes me feel better.

There isn't enough money to be made of it. NDAs are a big turn-off for me. I think they are only viable when dealing with big IPs (Star Wars, Fallout and such). This applies to RPGs, Board Games and even video games. As an Indie dev - getting people on board of your project early is the key to success. This is the easiest way to get "super fans". Don't shoot yourself in the foot with NDAs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436348/#Comment_436348" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T21:03:10+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  9:03PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Enough with the NDA stuff!
