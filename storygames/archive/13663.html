You had to write the right kind of fiction, of course; high quality prose, pointed and captivating. And it would indeed need to convey its agenda in a flash, to make sure the readers did not end up thinking; "What should I bother reading this?"<br/><br/>The inherent problem with such texts is that they are easily seen as deviations from the real agenda of the game-book;<i> to enable us (the players) to enter game-play as fast as possible.</i><br/><br/>But I dare you: go for it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309044/#Comment_309044" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T00:17:50+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 12:17AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2011 12:19AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: k.graz</cite>What kind of stories/examples help flesh out a setting best for you?<br/>Do you prefer something creative or something more encyclopedic<br/></blockquote>\nThese days, I think I prefer something more encyclopedic, at least in the sense that I want to be <i>informed</i> more than I want to be <i>entertained</i>.  Like Tomas says, I want to get into playing the game as soon as possible, which makes it important to get the right information into my hands as efficiently as you can.<br/><br/>That doesn't necessarily preclude a creative approach, it just means that as far as I'm concerned, your job is to give me tools to use in the game so we can tell our own story there, not to tell me your own story.  You can play with the format to some extent, as long as the informational content is still there and it's still useful as a reference.  A good rule of thumb would be to ask whether someone who half-remembers a particular detail will be able to look it up quickly; if I have to scan through four paragraphs of dialogue in two separate sections just to find out what the clergy are forbidden from doing within the major religious sect of your fantasy nation, that's not good.<br/><br/>I'm okay with micro-fiction to illustrate things (how a device works, how a skill works, what happens when a cop pulls someone over, etc.), because those are very short and hopefully demonstrate something about how the game works in play.  The format alone tends to keep those things on-point and unobtrusive.<br/><br/>What I really, really don't like are full-on short stories in my gaming books:  I simply can't use them for anything.  In the worst cases, they poison the well for particular character types or plot elements, because now "It's been done before."  And really, in the space that you are wasting telling me this short story, you could have told me things that I could have actually used at our table.  There must be something better you could have used those pages for, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309052/#Comment_309052" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T00:53:22+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 12:53AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a problem when fiction is used as an example, but when I pick up a new book I automatically skip over the BG fluff in favour of finding the crunch.

So for example, instead of writing a regular piece of fiction like, <br/><br/>"Argo led his troop through the alien jungle, when suddenly he felt something whoosh by his face!" <br/><br/>you'd write, <br/><br/>"GM: Okay, so Argo, you're walking through the alien jungle. Make a readiness check."<br/>"Argo's Player: 4. Not so good."<br/>"GM: Not so good indeed. You feel something whoosh by your face!"<br/><br/>The key here is that not only does this tell a story, but it tells us how using the rules of the game create the kind of story we want to tell also. Now, as a GM or player, I can see how readiness checks can lead to exciting complications and look forward to making one.<br/><br/>If you do this in a more extended manner like in Apocalypse World, for instance, then these could really be bits of micro-fiction. You could render these characters *just* enough that we could take an interest in what happens to them, but not so much that we think the game is about them rather than your own characters.<br/><br/>That said, I think the microfiction in Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies is a good example of setting prose, which isn't an example of the rules as I was just describing, but it still works well to evoke the setting. Perhaps it's not even microfiction in that book so much as anecdotes, like, when the writer is talking about what happens when you go to the deep area below the actual "skies" of the setting, he uses a micro story of a guy who saw someone try to go there, down into the mist, and never came back up again. It's evocative and it makes you want to go there and check it out too, but it works because it's not actually about the author's characters -- it's just an NPC enticing you to go check something out, the same as would happen in a game.<br/><br/>That's the key I think. Keep *your* story out of it. Push everything so that it inspires or instructs us how to make *our* stories with your tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309090/#Comment_309090" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T09:00:38+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  9:00AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this could be done well (although it's a challenge).<br/><br/>I would want to be sure, though, that the game/book tells and shows me exactly how I can leverage this micro-fiction into play.<br/><br/>So, maybe a (very) short story, and then later an example of how to use something in the story to create an interesting plot/character element?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309115/#Comment_309115" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T11:42:36+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 11:42AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is fantastic advice...thank you so much!

I put an abbreviated version of one in Fiasco and it has been well received, although it's really just an extended example rather than a true replay. But the idea of combining an engaging narrative with social stuff, table talk, and procedural information is pretty cool. I think you can communicate tone that way, more subtle expectations of how you think the game ought to be played, bits of guidance about social interaction that would be lost in a normal rule-set.

Ethnographies are authoritative, narrative and descriptive. Thus, if the ethnographer doesn't have a problem talking about the specifics of a spear, its uses, meaning, the people of the Mud Flats who use it and Roflball who told about him all these things. So, it avoids the problems of a purely fictive account (e.g. micro or short fiction) because the objects, peoples and cultures in question can just be talked about directly and in a somewhat abstracted or technical form. But it can also include specific characters, places, things and events that the author is trying to describe in terms of a narrative. <br/><br/>Thus, you get the technical and the narrative, the subjective and objective accounts of setting: the Mud Flats and the Muck-Fishers, Roflball, their language, that time behind the Chem Shed where you and Roflball speared a Lurker and the stories that Roflball tells his daughter at night, &amp;c. <br/><br/>For the love of God please make it like contemporary ethnographic accounts and not some facsimile of a medieval tome of fabulous creatures or some wizards cryptic stories about the far realms or some such. <br/><br/>I mean, most setting documents are fictional ethnographies, but I feel that most authors have never thought about that way or read an actual ethnography. <br/><br/>Also it bears noting that journalists and social scientists peruse the same things, albeit with different methods and audiences, and embedded reporters are a kind of 'live' ethnographer. Thus, with the theme of military SF, I have some kind of reporter talking about the lives of the soldiers and civilians. I'd couple them with military field reports, 'sit-reps,' and technical training manuals for weapons or ships or whatever.<br/><br/>Just a few thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309223/#Comment_309223" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T10:31:49+00:00" title="January 23, 2011 10:31AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>Thus, with the theme of military SF, I have some kind of reporter talking about the lives of the soldiers and civilians.
