Grr...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, anyway, I'm here to generally disseminate my WiP homebrew RPG; G-Ops - Elegy of the Battlefield, best described as a gameplay mixture of Necromunda, Warmachine, Front Mission and Armored Core with the universe and feel of Xenogears and Mobile Suit Gundam. Not intended as a simulation the way Mekton is, but instead a distillation, an emulation of your typical "Real Robot" mecha series and the character interactions within while being tactical and wargamey enough for those who are in for the bots and explosions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy primary objectives were to produce an experience that was A. Involving, some measure of drama that goes along with a war story B. Exciting, has chances for big success or death while things blow up and C. Fulfills that certain hunger for tinkering weapons and equipment combinations while being relatively balanced. Well, so far I seem to have somehow stumbled upon a winning combination of mechanics, and such I'm just looking around for feedback on its current state.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here's my preliminary blurb on what the darn thing is...<br/>\n<br/>\nG - ops: Elegy of the Battlefield is a cinematic tabletop tactical skirmish RPG featuring battling mecha heavily inspired by a variety of sources, among them the video games Armored Core, Xenogears and Front Mission and shows like Armored Trooper Votoms, Macross and Mobile Suit Gundam.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers lead their small squad of pilots through missions, cooperating against a GM or against each other. Characters gain experience through combat and role playing objectives, enabling them to gain additional skills and resources in order to improve your squad. The system allows for high level of freedom in customizing pilots and their respective machines in order to suit one's preferred style of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnits are composed of the chosen combatants, represented by pilots and their personal machines drawn from your pool of resources. Pilots and machines possess characteristics and skills which govern how well they fight. These units, taken altogether and deployed onto the battlefield are grouped into a squad. Squads are composed of a commanding officer (CO) and the soldiers under his command.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CO unit is the core of the squad on the battlefield, a unique pilot character whom the player creates himself. Beneath him are the members of the squad, minor individuals who may develop over the course of the campaign and become full-fledged characters in their own right. Leading your squad to victory in the battlefield not only brings valuable experience and resources to your struggling squad allowing access to better skills, upgraded machines and deadlier weapons but also affects the greater storyline of the chosen campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading!

Which is good for people like me who like mecha games <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  A couple of questions, at first glance.<br/><br/>Why are AP determined so randomly?  Having 1 or 6 AP seems like it could lead to a lot of imbalance, if the dice come up that way a few times.<br/><br/>I see the tactical skirmish miniature game, but I'm not sure I see much in the way of roleplaying mechanics, aside from a list of skills.  Is that still coming, or are you focusing on having a miniatures game where people do some freeform roleplaying between fights (which is perfectly fine, of course)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God" title="Silicon God"><img alt="Silicon God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God">Silicon God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222663/#Comment_222663" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T07:21:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  7:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for commenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, my game endeavors to be a bit more different, being born more out of the console strategy RPG genre (Front Mission, Assault Trooper Valken, Super Robot Wars, there's even a bit of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri there) and 80's-era Real Robot shows like Dragonar and Layzner than contemporary mecha anime. Though it would still allow for that sort of game, if players are keen to adapt...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom experience, luck does play a huge part in the source material; however, from what's provided in-game having more AP does not mean having a huge advantage. EX points, Bullet dice and roleplaying bonuses are there to help mitigate any gigantic disjunct in advantages. Still, the jury's still out on this one.That's what playtesting is for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, this is a work in progress, and contains a fraction of the initial force dispositions and RP mechanics. I'll add them in later updates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God" title="Silicon God"><img alt="Silicon God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God">Silicon God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222880/#Comment_222880" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T20:39:36+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  8:39PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some errors and inconsistencies fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nrevised version:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/file/jm2wmjd4zjz/G-ops- starter rules v0.6cFIXED.rtf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God" title="Silicon God"><img alt="Silicon God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God">Silicon God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223442/#Comment_223442" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T13:15:49+00:00" title="August  8, 2009  1:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2009 1:55PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New version out, more or less completely playable.

Grr...</blockquote>\nOne of the reasons you might be having trouble getting replies is that you haven't made a roleplaying game, you've made a wargame where each player controls an individual piece. Another problem in getting responses is how you present your game, showing it off as derivative of other games. Why should I play your game and not the videogames that inspired it?<br/><br/>You've been inspired by the Gundam videogame, and not the Gundam stories, by the VOTOMS videogame, and not the Votoms story. I can see it in the game itself, but as much as I love mecha stuff, this capability-comparison approach (I wouldn't say tactical, as there are really very few tactical choices) bores me to tears. The threat of death is not enough to inspire drama. It has to be combined with a reason to live, and that's what's missing from your game. That's what's found in the mecha stories, but downplayed or simplified in the mecha videogames. I want to roleplay the stories, not play the videogame in slow-motion using dice. Nonetheless, your chosen style does have its audience.

I would even go so far as to suggest the storygames forums seem aimed at people seeking to try new approaches to designing rpgs. If I wanted a mecha game with a lot of drama, I'd take a very, very different approach, but let me set that aside for now.<br/><br/>You want to know why I see your game as more about comparing attributes than about tactics. You can think of tactics as during-fight decisions, and comparing attributes as picking stats/mecha decisions that occur before the fight, possibly at character creation.<br/><br/>What choices do you present characters during the fight?<br/>- the choice of distance<br/>- the choice of weapon<br/>- the choice of target<br/><br/>What complications do you present?<br/>- ammunition limits<br/>- terrain (kind of vague right now)<br/><br/>What isn't covered?<br/>- speed modifiers (or inertia in the vacuum of space)<br/>- direction<br/>- pilot's emotional and mental state (fear and adrenaline matters more than a gun's accuracy for determining hits, and don't get me started on the mindgames of melee) and how this can change through the battle, and what can change it<br/>- intelligence (can you detect the opponents? what do you detect about them? what can you do to prevent being detected?)<br/>- leadership (Warmachine is a good example of this going beyond just leadership rolls)<br/>- how do people work together (e.g. can you construct a crossfire? can one mecha defend another? etc.)<br/>- fuel (for motion)<br/>- changing terrain (knocking down buildings and other changes that occur mid-battle, like laying smoke)<br/><br/>Once you've decided which tactical elements you want characters to be thinking about, you then have to decide how much emphasis you want on those tactics. Simply put, are the bonuses given by tactics greater than the differences in attributes between mecha?<br/><br/>There is one more element, shaping how you encourage players to describe their tactics, their characters' mental and emotional states, and all that, but that's drifting towards different approaches to game design, so I'll leave it aside for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God" title="Silicon God"><img alt="Silicon God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God">Silicon God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223591/#Comment_223591" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T21:24:54+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  9:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that's more like it.

I worry that they might take the focus off the kind of tactical crunch you seem to want to focus on, though (making your game one I might like more but one that you might like less).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Silicon God</cite>Been working on the project a while, and I've got a few questions...<br/><br/>Has anyone had any experiences concerning a system wherein the players themselves have a hand in creating the cast of characters above and beyond their own and not just the GM?<br/></blockquote>\nThis is great for getting character investment in NPCs.  I've made plenty of NPCs that no one cares about, and it sucks.  Some games use a "drafting" mechanism, where you collectively create the cast of characters for the game and then people pick PCs from the list (the rest become NPCs).  Off the top of my head, Misspent Youth and In a Wicked Age both do this.<br/><br/>Others let players create relationship characters (they may have more or less control over fiddly things like stats).  Burning Wheel does this, it's a common drift in D&amp;D games I've played, and even Pendragon sort of does it, with the family/dynasty rules.<br/><br/>Some games combine drafting and relationships - Burning Empires, e.g..<br/><br/>My one warning would be that, to make this sing, you probably need some substantial way in which characters encounter "their" NPCs as something more than "pilot of the red skull mech."  First, if most of what counts is tactical, making up all the mechanics could lead to boredom or munchkinism.  Second, if you succeed in making people care, they're probably going to want it to *matter* somehow, quite possibly mechanically.  That may interfere with your take on a "realistic" mecha combat system.\n<blockquote><br/>Is it a good idea to institute actual character rewards (i.e. EX Points, as M&amp;M does with Hero Points) within roleplaying sections? Or would that ultimately defeat the purpose of the roleplaying sections as means to develop characters and advance the storyline?<br/></blockquote>\nI say yeah, it's a good idea.  Why would incentivizing players to advance the storyline make them stop doing it?  YMMV - there's another thread on here about whether or not mechanics inhibit role-playing.  Consider: would you be as worried about giving someone +1 on a roll if they described their mecha's attack in a particularly awesome way rather than saying, "I shoot him with my gun?"  If that's fine, why not give her +1 for describing an awesome emo shoegaze scene?<br/><br/>For examples of systems that use this, see maybe fan mail in Primetime Adventures and Artha in Burning Wheel/Empires/Mouse Guard.\n<blockquote><br/>Structured cooperative roleplaying, putting scenes into a certain order, i.e. Introduction, Development, Conflict, Resolution; yea or nay?<br/></blockquote>\nA godsend for the harried GM, and why should the GM have to have all the creativity.  There are a zillion systems that do this to some degree - even D&amp;D 4E has player-authored quests which do something like this.  I'm not sure how much you have in mind player scene framing or player plot control.  In my book, both are awesome.<br/><br/>I think a lot of the answers to these questions have to do with what your game is *about*, though.  Is it about cool mecha fights and geeking out over ROF and armor ablation?  Then probably you want a hack of Mechwarrior that fixes whatever bugged you about it, and the rest is fluff you shouldn't worry about.  If you rope someone like me in by telling me it's about overwrought anime relationships, though, I'm going to want to know why the blast radius on my cannon makes a difference to whether I win fights but how angry I am at my ex (who pilots the red skull mecha) for cheating on me doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God" title="Silicon God"><img alt="Silicon God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God">Silicon God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224376/#Comment_224376" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T18:59:28+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  6:59PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't it be both?

Is it:<br/><br/>1. PCs' character traits are somehow combat-relevant, like (a) I have a fiery temper, which unlocks Tempest Blow, or (b) I attack using "firey temper!"  I defend using "cool, calm, and collected!"<br/><br/>2. PCs' roleplaying "unlocks" combat stuff more indirectly, like: Scene 1 - I reconcile with my father and he gives me the prototype wave-motion cannon.  Scene 2 - I kick ass with my wave-motion cannon, freeing my long-lost sister.  Scene 3 - I want to reconcile with my sister, but she says I must first defeat the Red Skull Mech, etc.  This could be kind of a cool feedback loop - non-combat scenes create problems you solve through combat, which then unlocks powers for future combat (sort of like - you don't go down to the Armored Core "garage" to get a new chassis, you need to acquire it through RP - maybe more appropriate for a setting where  mechs are weird alien tech or hand-crafted, etc.).<br/><br/>If this is the way you're thinking of going, find Adam Dray and talk to him about his Towerlands project, as he's been talking about a similar relationship-based approach to building character abilities.<br/><br/>3. Both?<br/><br/>4. Neither?<br/><br/>Also, the Power 19 is uber-useful...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God" title="Silicon God"><img alt="Silicon God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silicon%20God">Silicon God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226076/#Comment_226076" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T21:26:51+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  9:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its Number Two. Number one's a bit like Trigger Discipline or RISUS/Feng Shui.<br/><br/>What I plan to make of it is that its not just a tac/hackandslash RPG nor is it purely narrativist; its both.<br/><br/>I haven't been able to work on the project a while, since real life's been catching up. I'll be releasing an overhauled version with the roleplaying rules rather than jsut the combat engine in five days; I've got the ideas in my head and I just need to sit down one of these nights and write.<br/><br/>So far, here's the ideas I plan to implement;<br/><br/>Advanced Character Creation for Roleplay Campaigns (hereafter referred to as Series Campaigns) will involve a series of steps that illustrate the background and temperament of your character, above and beyond mere stats and skill ranks.<br/><br/>Proposed elements are: Background, Aspects, Development and finally Quirks.<br/><br/>Background involves the past life of the PC, drawn from either the player's own devices or from a random table depending on where in the game setting the PC came from.<br/><br/>Aspects involve the PC's temperament and attitude; there are three categories of Aspects; Positive, Neutral and Negative. Players choose two, neither of which can be from the same Aspect. Determines whether the character can be a hero, antihero or villain.<br/><br/>Development involves a motivation; why does the character do what she does? Again, this can be something of the player's own devising or randomly generated.<br/><br/>Quirks refer to the previously included random tables.<br/><br/>Collectively, these characteristics are known as Character Traits.<br/><br/>If you've read that part about EX abilities and stuff; those are going to tie directly into the system of Character Aspects. The Personality Quirks table is going to reinforce character creation and roleplay rather than being the locus of it.<br/><br/>Acting in accordance with your Character Traits may earn you the chance to take the story into different directions (which I will develop further in another post; let it be said that it involves something like "taking the reins" of the story) and earn you EX points and abilities for combat.<br/><br/>*whew!*<br/><br/>Power 19, incoming.

What do the characters do?<br/><br/><b>Fight in interesting ways, emote in interesting ways to fight better.</b><br/><br/>3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?<br/><br/><b>Make decisions for their character, control that character in combat, roleplay as that character, have a hand in controlling the flow of RP sessions or Episodes</b><br/><br/>4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/><br/><b>Can't answer that. There's a setting though.</b><br/><br/>5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?<br/><br/><b>Invokes genre tropes to convey the feel of a mecha series. Otherwise, facilitates quick play for wargame battles using the engine.</b><br/><br/>6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?<br/><br/><b>Uhh...

How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?<br/><br/><b>Everyone has a hand in the story. Except in combat results.</b><br/><br/>9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)<br/><br/><b>Can't answer this now, but I'd like for players to be attached to their characters and perhaps even the NPCs - since lethality is high - but not too high that life is trivial.

How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?<br/><br/><b>Bullet dice. Genre trope integration.</b><br/><br/>12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?<br/><br/><b>Characters accrue EX Points that can be spent to provide combat boosts through roleplaying in accordance with their character traits. Gaining a certain number of EX Points results in character development which may change the character (storywise) and provide more EX skills or technological bonuses/allies (taking rein of the campaign)</b><br/><br/>13.)

What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?<br/><br/><b>No idea yet.</b><br/><br/>15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?<br/><br/><b>Combat results. Survival or not. Clash of rival forces. Relationship dynamics.</b><br/><br/>16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in?

Or something like that...
