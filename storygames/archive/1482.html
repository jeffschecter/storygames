                    (x-posted with The Forge)<br/><br/>So, I wrote this game called Perfect.<br/>And now, I've kinda got this cool idea: Elaborate on the setting, the history of Cadence, create some game fiction, collect some AP reports, take some quotes from source material... and publish this as a free PDF on my site.<br/><br/>Cadence: The Perfect World<br/><br/>So, someone who's read Perfect can pick it up, read more into the setting, flesh out their narration. There might be a few NPCs or locations they can work into the game if there are openings. There is genre fiction to totally hammer home what Perfect is about (to me.)<br/>There are AP reports (mine, Ron's, any others that come to light*) so that people can get an idea of how play works, what are some pitfalls, and tips.<br/>Maybe there is a set of sample characters (for Con games and quick demo sessions), and a blank character sheet.<br/><br/>*Assuming those people gave me permission to publish their AP reports, of course!<br/><br/>So.<br/>Questions:<br/>1.) Is this a cool idea?<br/>For the people who have Perfect or are interested: Would you grab this free PDF and read it?<br/><br/>2.) Is this a cool way to... I dunno, continue offering my customers support beyond the book itself?<br/><br/>3.) Will this somehow promote people reading the PDF of the world and then buying the game?<br/>Will it do the opposite? Will people feel less motivated to buy the game if they already have the Cool Colour?<br/><br/>4.) What would you want to see in such a PDF? How long would you want it to be?<br/><br/>5.) There is a bunch of setting stuff in the book proper. Should that info be repeated in the PDF, or should it be assumed that people who have the PDF have already read the book?<br/><br/>6.) Other feedback and comments welcome and wanted!                </div>

                            The way I see it, Joe, you should answer this question first: (a) what do you want to do/write/create?<br/><br/>If you want to elaborate the setting, or write in-game fiction, or whatever, go ahead and do that.  Whether you package it up and publish it as a companion (which is cool), incorporate it into a Perfect Second Edition in a few years (which is cool), or simply put it up on a website for reading and download (which is cool), those decisions need to be based on what content you're talking about, which should be based on what you want to write up.<br/><br/>Just as a stupid datapoint, I've written fanfic for my own games, just because I had an idea that intrigued me and I wanted to develop and flesh out.  I really wanted to write the story, you know?  I haven't done anything with any of it, but I do keep it stored away for potential later use.                        </div>

                            (a.) what do you want to do/write/create?<br/>I want to create a PDF resource for Perfect - something that is interesting to read, starts some new ideas firing, and can be incorporated into your own games of Perfect.<br/><br/>I want a d20 player to find the PDF, download it, and be able to base his next d20 Modern/Past game in Cadence.<br/>Maybe this guy even decides that "This is so frickin' cool, I'm going to buy the book. Even though it's played with d6's."<br/>That's not a requirement, that it hook him on indie gaming, but it'd be hella cool if it happened.<br/><br/>I want someone who already has Perfect to use this as a tool to gain a better understanding of the world.<br/><br/>I intentionally left genre fiction out of the rulebook. I elaborated on setting, but in a textbook-y kind of way.<br/>I did this intentionally, for a specific reason: accessibility. Some people think the setting is hella cool (which, for the record, it is) but at the same time dislike reading that particular genre or struggle with it (I am more concerned with the latter).<br/>So... I kinda want to say, "Hey, here's all these cool short stories about the setting."<br/><br/>I also would love to do some "Ministry of Criminal Rehabilitation newsletter" kind of things.<br/>Primary source news-clippings, etc.<br/>Pamphlets from the Alliance of Purity.<br/>Newspaper clipings from the The Sentinels.<br/><br/>I would also like to take Actual Play posts, and jam them into the book.<br/><br/>So... You have setting information, fanfic-y genre fiction, cool primary-source type artifacts from Cadence, and Actual Play awesomeness.<br/>Um...<br/>Oh! And demo materials to run demos at cons!<br/>And blank character sheets!<br/>And nine thousand other things!<br/><br/>*deep breaths*<br/><br/>So... my question is: I have all these cool ideas about stuff I could include in such a document... What would be cool for you, as a reader? What cool stuff have I not mentioned that you'd like to see?                        </div>

                            This reminds me of the companion book to The Mountain Witch, whose name I cannot recall -- as best I understand it, it's an edited short story compilation. When I read TMW and when I saw awesome Actual Play about it, my first concern (after the "whoa, awesome" wore off) was that running the game required a lot stronger handle on the colour and the inspiration sources than I had. Japanese mythology is not something I know a lot about, I've only seen a few Kurosawa movies, etc. So for me, the fact that Tim put out this kind of companion made perfect sense, because [i]the colour seemed so important to solid gameplay.[/i]<br/><br/>Now, what's being proposed here is a lot more directly related to the gameplay -- it's more like 'seeing how people play the game is so important to solid gameplay', which seems generically true of all games (whereas many games would not really benefit from a companion of pure-colour short stories.) I think it's a cool idea, and I think that in general offering extra support and .pdfs on a game's website is a good move for PR in all directions.                        </div>

                            Awesome.<br/>I'm thinking of "Who Art in Heaven", the short story/actual play documentation written by Ben Lehman, in Shock: Social Science Fiction.<br/>I'm also thinking of Kwaidan, the mountain witch supplement.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking of Ron's comment that it'd be cool if I took his AP reports and made them available on my website.<br/><br/>********<br/><br/>Tangent: Darcy Burgess just agreed to write a short story for inclusion in this PDF/book. Awesome!                        </div>

                            Dude!  Next time you name drop, just stop at Ron.<br/>

My mad indie cred is well...let's just say I won't be retiring on it.<br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness, I think that this will be a sweet project and I'm glad that you asked me to contribute.                        </div>
