I once designed a sport, which I called tagball.  It was something like baseball played on a football (American-style) field.  One team (offense) serves (volleyball style) a ball to the other (defense), then tries to send a runner to the other end of the field to score a goal.  The other team tries to catch the ball then have the guy with the ball tag the runner out.  I think the way I had it was that offense gets four tries to score a goal; there's some way one side or the other halts the current play to start another one, I can't remember.  It's never been playtested, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71917/#Comment_71917" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T16:00:10+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  4:00PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2007 4:01PM by misuba.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WhatsOld/2001/WN.09.06.01.html" rel="nofollow">Giant Icehouse</a> becomes rather sport-like... to the point where I'm looking into organizing a league in the Northwest this summer.<br/><br/>Tagball sounds pretty promising.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

You play on a basketball court with two teams of two players. Each team consists of one forward armed with a tennis racket and one keeper armed with a lacrosse stick. Each team must stay on their own half of the court. Behind each basket was one of those cushiony mats affixed to the wall (presumably to prevent injury on breakaway layups). The game is easy: You score a goal by hitting your opponent's mat with the tennis ball. No hands. Obviously, the forwards would try to smash the ball. But there was a really nifty surprise play, where the keeper lofted the ball at just the right angle over the opposing team's basket. If done just right, the ball would strike the back wall, bounce off the <i>back</i> of the backboard and carom onto the mat.<br/><br/>Like I said, that was 20 years ago, and I still think about it fondly today. A lot of fun coming up with that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71922/#Comment_71922" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T16:32:21+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  4:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was tinkering with <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/474861.html?nc=14" rel="nofollow">Zombie Tag</a> last year and a GenCon employee I'm friends with suggested running it as an event throughout the convention center.

We taught some of the lesser grades to play, and reserved a particular part of the schoolyard, where the older grades didn't tend to hang out.<br/><br/>I'm sure the game itself was nothing special, but the feeling of having invented it was memorable and awesome -- even though I bet nearly identical variants already existed beforehand. Of course, playground games may not have the rigor necessary to qualify as 'sport design', but whatever.

Essentially, you hit the balls around on the field and try to get them to touch the other balls to store points.  It has its own terminology, such as scoring a point being called a "Poompf," to go after scoring being called a "Courtesy Thwack," and to score again on the Courtesy Thwack called a "Double Poompf."  A "Gimme" is when your ball is within a mallet's width of another ball but not close enough to touch, and you score a Poompf then.  We also have rules regarding "Gardening" (changing the landscape) and "Children and Pets" (in that if a toddler or pet changes the location of a ball, it is considered fair game wherever it lands -- this has lead to bribing of children to muck with the game in the past, though toddlers can rarely be replied upon to serve only you.)<br/><br/>There are a few variants to play.  English (or the default) involves Rock-Paper-Scissors to determine who goes second, third, etc.  (Whoever has the black ball always goes first.)  Australian rules involve dueling with the mallets as fencing weapons to setting who goes in what order and determines who scores on a Gimme.  A couple years back, we invented Brazilian rules, which is where you use your bare feet instead of a mallet.<br/><br/>This game's evolved over the last decade and probably was invented while my friends were drunk, but it's been a lot of fun for a silly, backyard sport.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72087/#Comment_72087" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T19:20:31+00:00" title="May 27, 2007  7:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We used to play "Completely Stupid" in slow lunch hours.

Filled with water, they were about as heavy as could be easily lifted and hefted around.  The game involved standing about four or five yards apart, and simultaneously hurling the thing at the other player's legs, skimming it across the ground.  The art of the game was to hurl the thing hard and accurately, but not to unbalance yourself enough to dodge out of the way of the leg-breaking doom-discus unleashed by the other player.
