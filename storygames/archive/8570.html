Currently the game is a Deadlands/Weird West campaign using Savage Worlds. In general, the play preference is for traditional games. I ran a Burning Wheel campaign, and, while there are a couple players who enjoyed it, it's a large group, and most of them didn't dig it all that much. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few of the players, including both GMs, have expressed a desire to use some story game / narrative-style mechanics, to keep the game from being nothing but combat encounters. <br/>\n<br/>\nI played a campaign with this group some time ago using Clinton Nixon's Sweet20 rules (essentially adding Shadow of Yesterday's Keys to D&amp;D), which met with mixed success. But the GMs are interested on some kind of explicit "flag" mechanic, and Savage Worlds is simple enough that it seems like something could be worked out. The Sweet20 D&amp;D hack doesn't quite fit, but I'd like to try something similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone not familiar, advancement in Savage Worlds is simple (and not particularly elegant). For each session, every players gets 1-3 experience points. When you collect 5, you get to pick one new thing, like an extra Edge, or a skill or attribute increase. Experience is awarded entirely by GM fiat; the book suggests giving out XP based on how successful the group was or how important the mission was. XP is tied in no way to character motives or actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience points are actually not all that significant in the rules. More significant are "bennies", which work as free re-rolls and so on during play and can't be carried from session to session. Again, they are awarded by GM fiat; the rules suggest giving at least 2 per player per session, usually when someone roleplays well, or does something humorous, significant or dramatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems like it could accept some sort of flag mechanic pretty easily, but such a mechanic would need to incorporate both experience points and bennies. I was thinking of letting each player choose two Keys (or something like Keys) for his character. But I'm not sure how to incorporate both advancement mechanisms.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - No need to point out that hacking traditional games to make them more like story games is not nearly as useful and time-effective as just playing story games to begin with. I agree, but this group enjoys Savage Worlds and plans to stay with it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189931/#Comment_189931" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T20:32:14+00:00" title="January 25, 2009  8:32PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I got a more important question for you - do you need <em>mechanics</em> to keep the game from being just combat encounters?</p>\n<p>I mean, I don't really think you do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189934/#Comment_189934" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T21:01:57+00:00" title="January 25, 2009  9:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you describe the "mixed success" more?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, instead of bringing in Keys, try to stay true to the SW rules, but then focus on Conflicts of Interests and avoid task resolution.

Something I don't think I made clear in my original post: I am not the GM for this game.<br>\n<br>\nRe: Mixed success with Sweet20<br>\n<br>\nI've played using these rules a few times. They work okay, but I think D&amp;D (especially in its current incarnation) is so carefully designed to support a specific style of play that adding new mechanics feels clunky. In my experience with Keys and D&amp;D, its chief benefit is to provide some explicit flags for a DM who's already committed to bring story elements into play, but it doesn't really help drive play in a meaningful way. (Not to knock Clinton's idea .. D&amp;D is what it is, you know?)<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that Savage Worlds is much more open and loose in terms of rules, I feel like there is room to stick in a whole new mechanic there without it feeling out-of-place.  That is to say, I think a similar rules hack would work better with SW than D&amp;D.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, we could simply make a more concerted effort to play a narrativist style SW game. But with this particular group (which is large, 7-8 people, and composed of many old-school and infrequent gamers), I think a game mechanic will be more effective. Specifically, I like how Keys work, since they force people to define their character's goals, and give the GM space to create meaningful villains and conflicts.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189940/#Comment_189940" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T22:14:32+00:00" title="January 25, 2009 10:14PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I've toyed with the notion of adding Aspects to SW and awarding Bennies when they're played as Hindrances, then letting Bennies trigger Aspects for certain benefits, like Aspect-related stunts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189945/#Comment_189945" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T23:59:47+00:00" title="January 25, 2009 11:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hm!

Is it D&amp;Dish in that you earn XP and use those to develop your character into a stronger, meaner version? If so, story-gamesifying this game will be tricky for long-term play. <br/><br/>For short term play, yeah, just ignore combat, set stakes for the combats that you do have, and focus on a different payoff. You can do Vanilla Narr play that way.<br/><br/>For long term play, it's harder. You'll find that, as much as you all try to focus on the premise stuff, the combat and character-building keeps getting in your face. Why? Well, because you haven't removed the strong reward mechanism already in the game. Players like building up characters. Once the character levels up, the player wants to try out the new stuff. That drives play down a certain road. One solution: Don't advance characters at all. Make up strong characters to start with, and just ignore the usual reward system. Graft in a Narr reward system, like keys or kickers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190031/#Comment_190031" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T11:14:33+00:00" title="January 26, 2009 11:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>You gain xp, though not necessarily for combat, you spend that xp to gain new abilities and over time increase in power.<br/><br/>So yes, storygaming that would be tricky.<br/><br/>That said, the OP doesn't really seem to require that, they just want it to not be all about combat.

By all accounts, everyone seems to enjoy it. But a few of the more engaged players would like to see a different kind of game, one where the focus is more on character and story and less on moving from fight scene to fight scene. Like I said, I am not the GM for this game, nor am I playing this particular game often (although I know the group pretty well).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the group is overly large. But this is a case of social obligations trumping gameplay considerations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't a situation where SOME players want a combat-based game and SOME want a story-based game, and there is disagreement. It's more that some want a story-based game, and the rest just show up and roll the bones. That is to say, not everyone has expressed a preference, but those who have feel that the game might be more fun and engaging if it was more character-driven. (And those players are precisely the ones with a high level of ownership/responsibility for the group).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, I may have used terminology incorrectly. I tried to avoid using the word "narrativist" for that very reason, but I think I failed. -2d to my next "theory discussion" roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190086/#Comment_190086" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T14:20:44+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  2:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So, you keep saying you have a problem, but you keep giving it the wrong name!

(Incompatible creative agendas, one might say, if one were willing to risk incorrect usage of theory terminology).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is a group of mostly married people with kids and jobs. No one has the time to be involved in two gaming groups, and no one is willing to "dump" anyone. Yes, the game might be more fun with fewer people, but optimizing fun is not worth the social damage that kicking people out of a friendly gaming group would inflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I am trying to come up with something that will improve the fun for the more focused RPGers, while preserving most of what the less-focused ones enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think it's fair or accurate to say that the other players "don't care anyway". They do care; they enjoy the game as a social experience, which is what RPGs are supposed to be in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190099/#Comment_190099" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T15:29:37+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  3:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2009 3:32PM by John_Powell.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is an easy way to storify any traditional system.
