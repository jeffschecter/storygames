It seems to very explicitly say that the GM makes the world privately without player input.</blockquote>\nOn page 11 of the PDF I've got it says:\n<blockquote><cite>Storming the Wizard's Tower</cite>Keep adding details! You can (and should) roughly alternate between telling the players details about the town and asking them for details about the town. It\u2019s very effective to mix telling and asking together into one, like \u201cthere\u2019s a wild hermit who lives near town. Where does it make sense for him to live, in the deep forest or up in the hills?\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nOf course, that's just about the Town.  The way I was reading StWT was that the GM actively makes "the next adventure" only after the current one is done, allowing the world (and adventures) to slowly grow and change, with a kind of active feedback loop between all the players, including the GM.<br/><br/>But that's just me, and certainly doesn't invalidate any other way of playing the game.

I'll just toss it out, and maybe someone else will have an insight.<br/><br/>We need a game system to define what characters can do in the fiction, i.e. who can they reasonable expect to take in a fight? What kind of magic can they work and when? Is it reasonable for them to try and trick an opponent? Sneak past? Realize they're being lied to or ambushed?  Likewise we need a system that somewhat defines the capabilities of the monsters.<br/><br/>Then, presumably, we'll make a plan for success in each challenge that uses our character capabilities to hopefully beat the monster capabilities.<br/><br/>Then we need a system for resolution. Most systems require some kind of player interaction, which means they won't be ideally suitable for solo play.<br/><br/>I'm not sure these are the same thing in the context of a solo dungeon challenge. For example, the Engle Matrix system can be used for resolution if someone is nominated as the referee, but it doesn't give us any guidance in creating characters. D&amp;D is commonly available and familiar for character creation, but doesn\u2019t give very wide resolution capabilities (covering basically straight up combat). StWT gives broader resolution, but still isn\u2019t optimized for solo play.<br/><br/>Would it be too confusing to use a hybrid system, where, for example, we make up characters using StWT but then use Engle Matrix for resolution?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190337/#Comment_190337" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T17:28:34+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  5:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we use the Engle Matrix does that imply we need a ref and can't go solo?

You're not going to get much of meaningful challenge play from solo execution of a rpg challenge, but what you can do is get interesting analytical discussion. This is what we see on the forums of challenge-based games: folks playing something like D&amp;D can very well "play solo" by running simulations about fighting trolls or whatever the rules system does, which then provides strategic data: what is the minimum level for a character who can kill a troll, what is the optimal class for him and so on and so forth. That sort of solo play seems to work quite fine for folks who have that sort of investment in a given game system.<br/><br/>In other words: asking "what is the minimum level of the D&amp;D character/party that could reasonably clear this dungeon?" seems to be a valid solo play challenge based on what people are doing in different places. "Can I challenge this dungeon and survive?" on the other hand seems like somewhat pointless as a solo exercise - at least people don't seem to be doing this sort of thing.<br/><br/>Of course it's valid to question whether fiction is actually being engaged in that sort of system-optimization exercise - after reading my share of 3rd edition D&amp;D character optimization and whatnot I'd answer affirmatively to a degree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190344/#Comment_190344" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T20:04:31+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  8:04PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero I am not sure if I fully understand what you are saying.

D&amp;D discussion forums sort of seem to get something like this out of speculative play, but from what I've seen, the focus is different from normal play: instead of having a specific character and specific conditions, the solo play shifts between ideas and resources and maps the space of possibilities that the rules and fiction offer in an effort to answer some generic question. So instead of a single play-through of a challenge you get an essay, essentially - an analysis of the fictional situation and the different ways that the challenges could be overcome. This is very different from the end-results of normal roleplaying.<br/><br/>As a concrete example of what I'm thinking of here... well, <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?t=101587" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> delves into the mechanics of creating invulnerable monsters in D&amp;D by cross-breeding trolls, and the potential challenges an evil wizard would face in executing such a plan under the rules - as well as the challenges in stopping an army of such "Ikea Tarrasques" when they attack your town. As far as I can see, this sort of discussion is quite close to "solo play" of challengeful fantasy adventure games - as close as I can imagine getting, in fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190352/#Comment_190352" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T21:10:51+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  9:10PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that is what we are going to be getting here. Tony's post back in the first dungeon thread suggested this as one of the things we do. I was thinking that we have our character (resources, rules, etc...) and see how we could approach each challenge in dungeon. The fiction of the challenge and outcome might cascade into other challenges. I think most of the challenges are linked to each other or open to new story elements being added in by a player. <br/><br/>A few questions I hope to have answers for after this is done:<br/><br/>1) I am curious given that all but two of the challenges are in the open how people will approach the character creation. The dungeon Color/Setting is available before characters are made.<br/><br/>2) How each player handles the challenge with the follow up analysis, outcomes, and possible changes to the overall fiction in the dungeon (above and below) using a given rule set<br/><br/>Umm there are probable others as well. But I think I will have to see how the AP works out for both the solo and group stuff.<br/><br/>Just back to system stuff for a moment. StWT is a cool system but I have some doubts about how it would handle running solo. I recall someone posting on Vincent's site about a group of just two player characters who were sounded schooled. I think the game works better with more characters. That would leave us with a retro-clone of some sort or just jump in with StWT. <br/><br/>I am leaning more towards a retro clone or some way of using Fantasy Trip.<br/><br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190393/#Comment_190393" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T08:03:45+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  8:03AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Engle Matrix Games require a referee (I guess you could solo them by acting as your own referee).
