The first deadline rather snuck up on me.  The deadline for having event requests in is the end of this month.  However, the convention has lost 30k square feet of space due to construction this year so tables are at a premium.  Turning in our requests on the very last day is likely a very bad idea.  Here's what I need from folks.<br/><br/>1.) What game(s) are you running?<br/>2.) If you want very specific time slots, let me know what they are.  If you just know how many sessions you are going to run and don't care about specific time slots, let me know that too. (I promise not to schedule you for 12 midnight or something silly.... unless you ask me to.)<br/>3.) How many players can your game handle?<br/>4.) A small blurg describing your game.<br/><br/>Oh... and I need your name.<br/><br/>If you run 4 sessions 6 players at 4 hours each, then you will get a complimentary GM badge.  I'm not sure if that is the same as it was last year but that's the deal this year.  I don't make those rules.  They come down from GenCon LLC.<br/><br/>I need this information by the 16th of March if at all possible.  If we go beyond that, we are stuck on the last round of approvals and our location might suck or not even be available.  As I said above, there's a premium on space this year.<br/><br/>You can send me the information at aecooper AT musfiber DOT com.  If you need to speak to me on the phone, send me an email and I'll send you my cell phone number and we can chat.<br/><br/>Here's who I have so far...<br/><br/>Jonathon Walton<br/>1 slot Geiger Counter<br/>1 slot The 108 Bravos of Mount Liang<br/><br/>Malcolm Craig<br/>1 slot Mob Justice<br/>1 slot Cold City<br/>1 slot Hot War<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>1 or 2 slots Dirty Secrets<br/><br/>Green Fairy Games<br/>6-8 slots of Fae Noir, Candy Creeps and other stuff.<br/><br/>If I don't have you listed above, I don't know about you yet.  If you are listed above but haven't sent me the information I need, please, send me the rest of the stuff.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134102/#Comment_134102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T13:48:29+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  1:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to confirm, Andrew, I've submitted my games, but they haven't been accepted yet.

I've heard back almost nothing from people about running games for IGE.  This is a bit disconcerting.  If you are planning on running any games under the IGE banner, please, get back to me as soon as humanly possible.  I need the answers to the questions I posted above.  I will be putting in all the GoD information on Sunday afternoon.  I will put in what I have for IGE then too.  If you haven't given me times or a brief game description, I don't know what to do.  After all, I don't know what other commitments you have to booths or whatnot.  Please, contact me in the next couple of days.  If you contact me after Sunday, I'll register the event but because it is close to the deadline, I can't guarantee you won't get a crappy location or even that you will get a location.  Remember, the convention center is being remodelled.  There's 30k less square footage.<br/><br/>Malcolm - Excellent.<br/><br/>Jonathan - I'm securing them Sunday.  But Games on Demand and IGE aren't the same thing really.  IGE is a regular, scheduled event.  GoD is show up and play who-the-hell-knows-what.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134887/#Comment_134887" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T10:45:16+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 10:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 10:46AM by Emily_Care.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Gaerik,<br/><br/>Thanks for putting this together! It's always touchy at GenCon to sign up to run things, since we spend so much time selling/demoing during the day and there is such a sweet pick-up-game scene at night with our friends.  But it is important to get on the program! I got some good playtest for Sign in Stranger that way.  <br/><br/>And if people are running something on the schedule at GenCon makes sense to be united and gain more visibility.  The Burning Wheel crew normally does as I recall. Who else is planning on it? <br/><br/>best,<br/>Em                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134891/#Comment_134891" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T11:06:52+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 11:06AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya: Honestly? I think Games on Demand is <b>&gt;</b> Indie Games Explosion.  After all, the latter is nothing more than individually scheduled events that just happen to be bridged together.  If there's little or no response on that end, I'd say tell people "Hey, free for all! If you want to run an event for some indie game, go for it! Good luck!" and then turn your attention on grabbing and keeping space for Games on Demand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135128/#Comment_135128" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T18:52:17+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  6:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on my BlackBerry out of town so I'll keep it short.
