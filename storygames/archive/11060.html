It was one of the best games I've played: ridiculous levels of intrigue and some great characters. Completely old-school, of course: if you were using the mechanics, you were doing something wrong. The point was to play your character.<br/><br/>Anyway! One of the old storytellers is starting up a game on Google Wave. It's old World of Darkness Vampire. If you'd like to play, you're welcome to join us. Do a search for "Veni Foras" and you should find it. If you don't, tell me, and I'll find a better way to link to it.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245362/#Comment_245362" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T09:56:30+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  9:56AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2009 10:04AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might be completely using the search feature wrong, but I can't get it.
