Whatever worked great in your game or just cool ideas in general.<br/><br/>I had a character that I did not start out with a name but a vague description and the question: "What Nickname did you give her that stuck?" The followed up with questions about how well that Nickname was liked.<br/>I put in an NPC whose dark secret was being a drug mule. But it could have been supernatural and got that character stuck at a murder scene without ever being able to tell anything about it without risking herself.<br/><br/>I will add a few more later once I talked with my players which they liked or more come to my mind by brainstorming.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ishnub" title="Ishnub"><img alt="Ishnub" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ishnub">Ishnub</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400398/#Comment_400398" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T19:43:45+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  7:43PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My homage to Leona Helmsley in a game I ran. <br/>Patricia \u201cPatty\u201d Helmsley: Math wiz and charter ( and only member) of the tutoring club at school.

Yeah, I know, right? But literally everyone calls him that, even the teacher. How did he manage to get that nickname to stick?"<br/><br/>Each time, the answer has been different.<br/><br/>One time he brought butterfly blades to school, and had allegedly hospitalized another kid by stabbing him in the gut.<br/><br/>The most recent time, the answer was super heart-breaking: "He's got a really rough home life, and not a lot of opportunities going on for him. This nickname was something he really wanted, and finally something his parents could actually give him, so they wrote him a note. And the teacher and all the kids agreed to fulfill his wish, mostly out of pity."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400443/#Comment_400443" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T06:21:04+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  6:21AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I am too stupid to use the search bar right, I totally overlooked that thread, sorry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400466/#Comment_400466" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T09:45:13+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  9:45AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, McDaldno kindly linked to the thread that had all my awesomest questions in it, so summoning me seems mostly redundant!<br/><br/>In hindsight, I'd say the best questions are the ones that connect people. And the questions that are tied specifically to the playbooks. "Why is your Dark Patron so interested in ______?" "Who does ____ remind you of from a century ago?" "What promise to you did ______ break?" NPCs that remind the PCs that they are monsters.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, "Why does _____ remind you that you are a monster?" is a pretty dynamite generic question. I'd even be tempted to throw that in once per PC if I were running it again.<br/><br/>Also fun: NPCs that remind the PCs that they are human.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400468/#Comment_400468" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T09:52:52+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  9:52AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Come to think of it, "Why does _____ remind you that you are a monster?" is a pretty dynamite generic question.
