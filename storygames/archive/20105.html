I loved the idea of magic, but I've always been somewhat disapointed in how magic is performed in the typical RPG. It usually boils down to a dice roll, and some sort of effect. I wanted to know what games really put some spin on their magic system to make it more evocative or make the mechanics feel like "magic"?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444157/#Comment_444157" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-17T14:51:34+00:00" title="March 17, 2015  2:51PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate this feature as well, I've always tended to judge the vision of magic first when it comes to fantasy games.

It's not really that uncommon property, mostly the feel of magic being ideologically and culturally dry and merely functional seems to stem from an overdose of simple adventure gaming; get out there and pay attention to the games that step outside the genre of "gaming fantasy", and the options are near limitless.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444158/#Comment_444158" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-17T14:53:13+00:00" title="March 17, 2015  2:53PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20102/journeyman-wizard-a-game-poem" rel="nofollow">My game poem</a>. &lt;=)<br/><br/>In stories, magic is limited arbitrarily by the author or by folklore, and it's generally rare. Rarity helps obviate the need for a set of rules for it. Only common magic needs detailed rules.<br/><br/>RPGs have lots of rules for magic for game balance reasons. All magic always has a cost. Free magic would be terrifyingly nasty for most games. So game designers carefully spell out (ha) the costs and effects of different magical formulae, and all the wonder fizzles out.<br/><br/>I have a backburner game design that is built around wondrous magic (with a little more crunch than the game poem there).

Until I read the entirety of your post I was going to say WoD's Mage has a pretty great system.  But that's just cause I think their free-form casting is excellent.  However, it certainly doesn't fulfill your second requirement, the mechanic to employ it is pretty much the same as the mechanic to do anything else in the game.  I had heard that Fate of the Norns has an interesting system, but I've yet to check that one out.  <br/><br/>...Only other thing I can think of, is edge of the empire's Force power system.  While not too terribly different from the rest of the mechanics in the game, you can do a couple unique things that simulate a force user holding a force power active.  force users get a number of force die = to their force rating.  Certain abilities let you commit a number of these die to maintaining the force power.  When this happens, you set that special die aside and can't roll it until you give up the use of the force power...... as I type this, it doesn't seem all that unique.<br/><br/>Well, as a last ditch effort, the Silcore system (one of the books, don't know which) has an interesting magic system that has you craft the components of your spell.  In doing so, I believe it gives you some more die to your pool? but I'm not a 100%.  Still, the actual crafting of spells during play I thought was a cool idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444162/#Comment_444162" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-17T15:27:14+00:00" title="March 17, 2015  3:27PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2015 3:28PM by James_Mullen.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Mortal Coil</b> has a pretty interesting take on Magic: when you spend a resource token to perform a new magic in the game, you get to define the effect, but another player defines the cost or other drawback of that magic.<br/><br/><b>Conspiracy X</b> had a sub-system for psi powers (which might as well be magic) that used Zener cards: I can't recall the exact mechanics, but you had to predict a card in order to use the power and the higher your power rating, the more chances you got to make your prediction.<br/><br/>In the <b>Orrorsh</b> setting for <b>Torg</b>, there was a ritual magic system that worked around describing your ritual, e.g. "I will research herb lore; this herb lore will identify magical plants; I will gather these plants and ferment them..." and so on.

The wizard also gets to make things, like wands, powders, potions, permanent engraved circles, standing stones, and the like. All of these things have magical properties, worked out between the wizard and the GM. Probably, the wizard just gets to define the property, and a skill check confirms what the player says the PC thinks ("I find sagegrass? That's good for... uh... it's good for dental pain, right?" "Make an Herbal Lore check.").<br/><br/>The player records all of these components and their properties.<br/><br/>When the player wants to work magic, she crafts a spell. She can scan through her list of components and properties for stuff she thinks should help, and make some kind of spell craft roll (Alchemy, Binding, Circles, etc.) to add the component to the spell. Success indicates adding dice or bonuses to the final spell check.<br/><br/>At last, the spell is built and a roll determines its success and cost.<br/><br/>The spell can be recorded (with all components and the roll peculiarities) and recast later, without all the combination skill checks, unless there's skill required to transform components somehow (and transformation and purification would be useful things to do, to reduce costs).<br/><br/>Oh, and the wizard can always "discover" new properties through some kind of roll during spell construction. ("Oh, sagegrass mixed with dragonscale powder is a fire suppressant, I think." "Roll Alchemy, difficult check.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444166/#Comment_444166" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-17T16:24:32+00:00" title="March 17, 2015  4:24PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/><b>Conspiracy X</b> had a sub-system for psi powers (which might as well be magic) that used Zener cards: I can't recall the exact mechanics, but you had to predict a card in order to use the power and the higher your power rating, the more chances you got to make your prediction.</blockquote>\nI distinctly remember thinking the sensory/prophetic psi-powers (aura reading, clairvoyance, etc) were very good about being consistently helpful while still being usefully vague (useful for the GM, that is), but it's been way too long since I read the books to recall anything specific.<br/><br/>CX also has a separate system for actual ritual magic spellcasting (focusing on the laws of sympathy, contagion, etc; I think John Snead had a hand in it), but I recall very little about it offhand.<br/><br/>There's always Sorceror, of course, in that your "spellbook" is an NPC you need to cajole, browbeat, and negotiate with to get anything done-- definitely keeps magic feeling a bit wild and feral.

From Ars Magica to Gemini. (Sorcerer did get away though.) None felt like it did what it wanted. Both the mentioned game even had spells(!).<br/><br/>I made my own for my game <b>Matin\xe9 </b>where you chose a theme and can do anything within that theme. The system only focuses on the effect it has on the world, if you use it in combat, to modify the world based on the theme, or to create something from nothing, and how many that will be affected or how long the spell lasted. The player could describe the effect in any way, but that didn't really matter. They could throw fireballs without having to include MOVEMENT + FIRE to get that effect. Just fire as the theme was needed.<br/><br/>Spells drained the wizard, like strong winds tores a sail, unless s/he could control the spell fully. Too much drain and the magic skill would increase. If a wizard got up to 15 in his or her magic skill (skills were between 1-20), the theme would affect how the magician perceived the world. A mage with fire as theme would become a pyromaniac, and the illusionist would start to live in a world of illusions. These things were something the game master should use to subjectively describe the world, were a fire could make a wizard get a homey feeling, or the illusionist could talk to people that the rest of the group would see as shadows.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Apart from that, I really like the feeling of <b>Deadlands</b>, where the wizards were hucksters that conjured poker hand to turn them into magical influences on the world.

When you summoned a creature you had to roll for each (except for bonding, unless you wanted to). You needed to roll for banishing at the end of the combat or if you wanted to banish another summoner's creature. You could also wrestre for control of another summoner's creature, except if it was bonded.<br/><br/>Anyway, the core book didn't have too many creatures and the guidelines for building one were way too complex for me and my group, so I ended making a list of difficulty target numbers for creatures per level, along witht the HP they got when summoned. The ruling for summoners was that they could give their creature any shape they wanted, let me know of which element was going to be and what level they intended to summon before rolling the dice. Results went from practical and interesting to incredibly hilarious but awesome. Like the time a PC summoned a gigantic holy sh*t as a practically suicidal last resort to stop the main villain. It happened on an island, and the skill roll went so high that the creature was seen from the shores of the continents beyond the sea.<br/><br/>Another of the things I loved from the mechanic was that a fumble on each skill meant a different thing. A fumble while summoning the creature meant that the creature ended up summoning you to their world (which happened on the first campaign and ended up serving as the origin an introduction for the main villain for the next 4 campaigns)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444187/#Comment_444187" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-17T21:38:00+00:00" title="March 17, 2015  9:38PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2015 10:05PM by BeePeeGee.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my <i>Golden Cobra Challenge 2014 - Magicians of the Cool</i> contribution is somewhat unique:<br/><a href="http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/GoldenCobra_MagiciansOfTheCool_BeePeeGee.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/GoldenCobra_MagiciansOfTheCool_BeePeeGee.pdf</a><br/><br/><i>Players represent magicians of four different magic schools based on the four<br/>elements: Fire, Air, Water and Earth.

What would also be fun (different kind) would be a system where even the effects tied components are randomized.  The skill check in that case would simply determine whether a GM tells you what the effect is or not (and upon critical failure tells you a false result).<br/><br/>Something like that could make a fun house-rule to a wacky game like Roll For Shoes so that you can have a game focused on wielding the power of magic, specifically.<br/><br/>Not sure how to make something like that "feel like magic" though.  With R4S maybe you do something where your description of the new magic skills you pick up have some implication against the resulting spell effects.  Like maybe each new skill(spell) has to be named as its rule: "Spells that can only be performed on the first Sunday of the month (3)"<br/><br/>And each number you increase it lets you add a new spell.<br/><br/>And everyone would need the "meta" skills, of course.  The primary(only?) one being "Spell Research (1)" or "Witchcraft (1)" or whatever you want to call it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
