The player of a character may be its creator or, if its creator is absent, another player who takes the role.<br/>Players must sit in marching order from left to right facing the GM.<br/>The position of caller cannot be held be a player attending WeD&amp;D for the first time.<br/>As the GM, I will endeavor to make all to-hit, damage and saving throw rolls in the open.<br/>Wandering monster, trap checks and other exploratory rolls will be concealed.<br/>Death of a character you created gives you the first pick for creating a new character. In order to exercise this privilege, you must attend the session following your demise.<br/>If one of the six characters is killed and its owner cannot attend the subsequent session to exercise his or her privilege, characters can be created by new players on a first-come first-serve basis.<br/>If you kill a character you did not create, you must provide the creator with a cupcake, cookie or brownie.<br/>Taking over NPCs upon character death: If any NPCs are available for play upon the death of a PC, that player shall take on the roll of an NPC until the conclusion of the session. At that point, the player can decide to remain in the role of the NPC and thus elevate it to PC status or she can return the NPC to its former status and make her own new character<br/>You may not deliberately suicide or kill off a character.<br/>Moldvay has provisions for generating Hopeless Characters. We defined \u201chopeless\u201d as a character with two or more penalties from stats.<br/>Moldvay has provisions for rerolling hit point dice that turn up a 1 or 2. We have embraced this enthusiastically. <br/>Tests against stats (d20 method) are used to resolve situations outside of the scope of combat, morale, reaction, saving throws and spells.<br/>Making a firebomb requires a Wisdom check<br/>Firebombs must be lit from an open flame <br/>Firebombs require a missile attack to-hit roll to be made against the target creature<br/>Firebombs ignite upon hitting on a 4+ on a D6. <br/>An unignited firebomb may be lit with a successful melee attack with a torch.<br/>If not in combat or simply attempting to block pursuit, there is no roll necessary to deposit flaming oil at a location. <br/>Rest on 6th Turn: We are not using the rule that requires the characters to rest every sixth turn of exploration. <br/>I believe it\u2019s unnecessary given that the rate of exploration is so slow (usually 60\u2019 per 10 minutes/1 Turn) and that combat lasts less than a minute but still still eats up a whole turn regardless of its actual duration in rounds.<br/>Also, since you usually spend so much time talking, the 1/6th rest rule seems triply redundant.<br/>Three watch rest: the rules in Moldvay are unclear how much time is exactly need to be considered rest. It says \u201ca day\u201d but what does that mean? B2 clarifies the point saying explicitly "24 hours are needed\u2026." We have played with the rule that surviving three watches undisturbed in a dungeon allows for recovery of 1-3 hp per character and recovery of spells. I believe our ruling should override the clarification of rest in B2 and stand as we've played it.<br/>Players determine the order of watches. If there is no encounter on their watch, they must rouse the next watch with a whispered \u201cAll quiet.\u201d or similar. If there is an encounter, that player is responsible for raising the alarm.<br/>Damage: We are using the optional damage rules for weapons as described in Moldvay. In addition, Moldvay states that the DM rolls for damage. While I see the clear benefit of this procedure, I am too stupid and disorganized to roll for each player's damage. Therefore, each player shall continue to roll his or her weapon and spell damage. <br/>Initiative: We use the optional rule for initiative called \u201cPaired Combat.\u201d<br/>Mining and Excavation: We have adopted the rather generous mining and excavation rules from the AD&amp;D Dungeoneer\u2019s Survival Guide. A STR check is also required.<br/>Rest: Resting in town costs money. Each hit point recovered from rest costs 3D6 gold.<br/>You may go into debt to your friends, the inn or local hospice <br/>If the price is too high for rest, you may move on to another town and reroll the cost.<br/>Travel: Travel overland or oversea via conveyance like caravan, post horse, roads, etc. costs money. Each hex traveled costs 2D6 gold. <br/>If traveling to a new location for a new dungeon, newly created characters do not have to pay this fee. They join the group once they reach their destination and thus do not travel per se.<br/>Javelins: Keep on the Borderlands describes javelins used by goblins, but there is no damage for javelin in Moldvay. I assigned them a damage of D4.<br/>Sipping a potion of invisibility (as described in Moldvay) causes invisibility that lasts for D4+4 turns. </li>\n</ul>\nThis list is numbered and subnumbered in its native form, but I can't figure out how to get the subnumbering feature to work in HTML.<br/>For example, Firebombs are all under one heading.<br/>But you get the idea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365807/#Comment_365807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T21:36:59+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  9:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This house rules list thing seems like a really great approach to keeping old-school play from devolving into the usual tarpit of crossed expectations this game usually runs into.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, hey, most important question... why 1989, specifically?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365808/#Comment_365808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T21:46:23+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  9:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            this list is great! i especially like its comprehensiveness.<br/><br/>also, re: 1989 - - because that's the year the wall <i>fell</i>, man! lol nah i just made that up. <br/>it does mean you can listen to Operation Ivy while playing, though, which is fine by me ^___^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365813/#Comment_365813" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T22:02:27+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 10:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1989 because it's the end of the 80s!

We're at capacity. Also despite the role of the caller and the recommendations for the game, I feel like six is the upper limit for dungeon crawling. <br/><br/>Check this out: In our set up we have a caller and two mappers. This also means that usually two other people are assisting the mappers (sometimes the caller is an assistant). Which means that one or two people are sitting around lost and bored at any given moment. The more players we add, the less they have to do. The less they have to do, the more boredom sets in. And boredom, as I've experienced, is a game-killer for multiple reasons. So six seems like our limit for keeping people focused and interested in the game. <br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365883/#Comment_365883" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T06:10:28+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:10AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 6:12AM by Teataine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (The original D&amp;D text suggests 4-50 players "in a single campaign".

Someone who keeps track of everything you find, how much it is worth, how much it weighs. Maybe someone can track time and resources. It's been x turns, time for a new torch! I haven't played enough to know all the possibilities. It just makes me wonder what Caller and Mapper like roles are hiding to be discovered.

When the caller's calling, everyone needs settle down. We had a couple of sessions when everyone was talking over each other and I couldn't hear the caller\u2014who was sitting right next to me. So there needs to be a time set out for other activities when those things aren't happening.<br/><br/>At the moment, in our group, the caller keeps the log of encounters and treasure. One player has proposed splitting the role into treasurer and caller. <br/>According to the rules, time is tracked by the GM.

I figured that each night around the campfire the adventurers would hand over treasure that they'd collected during the day's dungeoncrawling, the Quarter Master would log it and then divvy it out to be carried by members of the party. Any time after the party has gone to sleep for the night, the DM could 'audit' the Quarter Master and make sure that no one was over encumbered, all the gold was accounted for, etc.<br/><br/>EDIT: Luke and I cross posted. I think around the campfire is a good way to guarantee the Quarter Master has some quiet time: the other players will be figuring out how many HP their characters heal, which spells they prepare the next morning, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365896/#Comment_365896" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T06:53:18+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:53AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 7:04AM by Troy_Costisick.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke,<br/><br/>What roll has encumbrance played in your game?

They have an NPC hireling (magic user) whose job it is to carry the coinage. So far, the hall hasn't been so great that they've had a problem carrying it out. It usually amounts to less than 100 coins per head (though the value might be higher due to the presence of gems and jewelry).<br/><br/>D&amp;D can get troublesome when the players become walking weapon piles.

The other two tunnels are covered by a guard (usually one of the scouts, preferably the light fighter or the elf, while the party moves on (prevents nasty critters coming up from behind).<br/><br/>It's basically the same procedure as amilitary column on the move; You send out quick recon units to see what's up ahead and make sure noting is coming up on your own flanks.<br/><br/>Always sticking very tightly together is actually a very bad plan, despite traditions that have developed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366106/#Comment_366106" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T16:24:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  4:24PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We tested some of Kbob's assertions in our last two sessions.<br/><br/>In one session, they stuck together without recon and found themselves stumbling from ambush to ambush.<br/>In the next, they sent two invisible Elves forward and managed to avoid many ambushes and a trap.<br/>Movement rate, however, was slow.
