Our original art terms gave the artist complete ownership, so they'll either need to source new art or  secure the rights from Jeff Bent independently,and we made this very clear.  The contract stipulates that BPG gets a token percentage of sales and some comps.  They handle the translation, production, print fulfillment, and marketing.  So far, so good.  In your case, if you are thinking of an additional electronic product, it might make sense just to commission a professional translation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190640/#Comment_190640" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T08:28:01+00:00" title="January 30, 2009  8:28AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we do translations of other people's games, I offer payment in advance based on an agreed-upon print run and cover price. The deal is only for that one print run and needs to be renegotiated for new runs. Presumably if I wanted to do PDF versions, we'd agree on some sort of annual royalty arrangements or some such. However, I prefer to avoid annual deals of that sort if possible; much simpler if we just pay the designer his license fee at once and then take our time selling the print run. Other advantages of this model (which I strongly recommend to others whenever this topic comes up) are that financial responsibility and freedoms of the publisher are left squarely on the translating party, which can proceed to do whatever they want with the stock they print and pay license fees for. Same goes for the designer, who has no responsibilities or interests to protect here, except perhaps an interest in checking out our cover art and layout before we go to print. Other models have all sorts of annoying mutual responsibilities and trust issues that are simply not necessary, such as royalty accounting and the various fraud opportunities related to that. Much cleaner, simpler and more unambiguous to just agree upon how many books there are going to be, agree upon a fair license fee based on the expected market success, have the licensee pay and then forget the whole thing. Maximal freedom and maximal responsibility result in the most responsible and efficient execution of the whole project, I believe.<br/><br/>What the amount of payment should be is of course a matter for negotiation. However, the amount should likely be considerably lower than what a royalty agreement would bring, considering that the new publisher is taking the entire risk on the prospect, while the designer pockets his share regardless of what happens. We've done numbers around 5-10% of the projected cover price of the total print run in each project we've finished under this model. There hasn't been any serious problems or disagreements with any licensors - Timothy Kleiner still hasn't claimed his licensing fee for The Mountain Witch, but I'll get the money to him when he comes out of hiding, so I don't consider that a problem.<br/><br/>Now that I've been approached about translations of my own games, I've of course suggested similar arrangements to others as well. This sort of agreement is in many ways much more favorable to the designer than what people are used to; especially the advance payment part seems to stick to many a publisher's craw. It's not the advance payment part that speaks to my aesthetics, though, but the lump sum - it's not a problem to postpone the payment of the license fee for a year after the publication, for example, instead of paying it in advance or right after the publication. Another similar trouble-spot for other publishers seems to be the exclusivity clause; I don't ask for one myself when we translate because I want to minimize the mutual liabilities as a matter of principle. Others seem to be more afraid of competition, though (however unlikely that is in an indie market; good luck finding another guy who wants to do a Finnish edition of your game), so the exclusivity of the license might be a bigger deal for them.<br/><br/>I suggest that unless you're going to be handling the marketing and sales of the new edition yourself, you should not be the one paying the translator to translate your game. I find it improbable that a person could represent himself effectively in a market area he does not reside in or speak the language of. Let the person who's going to take the financial responsibility for marketing and the benefits of sales also pay the translator. If that's going to be you, get somebody local to partner with you and represent your interests in the market area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190657/#Comment_190657" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T10:00:03+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 10:00AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In some projects I am working on, the publisher owned the rights to all art and content, and the translator wasn't just translating, but rather selling it for a foreign market release.<br/><br/>In one instance we had all Profit (after all costs, etc) split half-half: 50% goes to the original publisher, 50% goes to the translater/publisher.<br/><br/>In another instance we came to terms with a solution:<br/>* Determine how many copies the translator will publish.<br/>* Determine the cover price of that product.<br/>* Send 5% of that amount in a one-lump sum within 30 days of first sale to the owning company.<br/>* Additional printings: Rinse and repeat.<br/>This does not take into consideration PDF sales, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190680/#Comment_190680" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T12:53:39+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 12:53PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I investigated this for Play Unsafe.
