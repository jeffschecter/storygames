We were elves, with Santa as the slaveowner. His ruthless overseers were Rudolph, whose nose glows red when he is angry, and Frosty The Snowman.<br/><br/>For our group goal, we avoided "Escape", which we thought Steve would guess too easily. Instead, we went for two: "Unionize" and "Form an Accordion Band".<br/><br/>Here's the characters. We got a bit confused with the differences between goals and tasks and motives, so they're all lumped in together.<br/><br/><b>Porky, age 85</b><br/><br/>I am an excellent giant killer<br/>I am very small and cute with orange hair<br/>I eat monsters<br/><br/>Friends: Donna, the North Wind<br/>Enemies: Gepetto<br/><br/>Goals: Unionize, Form An Accordion Band, Shag the Christmas Fairy, Shag Mary Christmas<br/><br/><b>Minger, age 48</b><br/><br/>Great at shimmying in tight lycra<br/>Good singer, belts out all Bond's theme tunes<br/>Can multitask, therefore most useful elf<br/>Great at NLP, so all the other elves love me and I am Santa Claus' favourite<br/>Drop anything breakable<br/>+4 for all rolls vs Simon<br/><br/>Friend: The Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (Cock Robin)<br/>Enemies: Michael Winner<br/><br/>Goals: The group ones, plus dance a solo for Santa Claus<br/><br/><b>Sparkle, age 200, secret name "Elrond Hubbard"</b><br/><br/>I am a leathermaker<br/>I have a beautiful singing voice<br/>I have a way with reindeer<br/>I can do elf kung-fu<br/><br/>Friends: St Hubbins, Goat, Mary Christmas<br/>Enemies: Jack Frost, Cock Robin<br/><br/>Goals and motives and things:<br/><br/>Unionize (Have secret meeting, get elves to join)<br/>Kill Cock Robin (Befriend cock robin, get alcohol to get him drunk)<br/>Form an accordion band (Get antlers, get skin and horns, get piano, teach other elves to play)<br/>Impregnate Mary Christmas<br/><br/><b>Carrots, age 12</b><br/><br/>I'm sneaky<br/>I'm good at persuading people<br/>I'm a red head<br/>I'm a good painter<br/><br/>Friends: Che, Gepetto<br/>Enemies: Frosty the Snowman, the North Wind<br/><br/>Goals and stuff<br/><br/>Take a joyride in the sleigh (Make friends with the reindeer, etc, etc)<br/>Subvert Christmas (Change the messages on the logo, mix up the list of toys)<br/><br/><b>Nobby, age 204</b><br/><br/>I am happy<br/>I like playing games<br/>I am addicted to candy floss<br/>I placate goats<br/>I have a laser gun<br/><br/>Friends: Frosty the Snowman, Cock Robin<br/>Enemies: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br/><br/>Goals: Unionize, Make Santa Happy, Form An Accordion Band                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184342/#Comment_184342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T18:56:43+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  6:56PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Umm...<br/><br/>So, how did it go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184368/#Comment_184368" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T23:43:32+00:00" title="December 19, 2008 11:43PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds either insanely awesome or deeply disturbing.

It was so chaotic I can't remember everything that happened.<br/><br/>Sparkle was trying to steal something from the toy workshop, I think. Rudolph noticed and charged after him, his nose glowing red. We also decided, I think, that Rudolph fired a laser beam from his nose when angry.<br/><br/>Nobby was using the bellows on the fire and secreted them away, to use to make an accordion later.<br/><br/>Sparkle ended up in a large Christmas pudding, for reasons I forget, and was rolled across the present-making hall. I believe Rudolph ate him out of the Christmas pudding to help him escape.<br/><br/>Michael Winner, a British restaurant critic, came to dine at Santa's grotto. He was obnoxious, of course. He began eating one of the goats. Sparkle did...something...I forget what...and ended up attempting to fellate the goat, but sucking its hoof instead. I must admit, that was more due to me trying to embarrass Simon (who played Sparkle) than to any attempt to advance the story.<br/><br/>Nobby was playing the piano and stole some of the keys, to make an accordion later.<br/><br/>Eventually, we collected the stuff to make an accordion and stood on the roofs of the elf-huts, playing "You Can't Get Me, I'm Part Of The Union". This, according to ancient elf-magic, caused Santa to explode, and we all formed a union and reinvented the Grotto as a cooperative.<br/><br/>Other stuff happened too, but it escapes my mind at the moment.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184477/#Comment_184477" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T06:11:45+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  6:11AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>That sounds either insanely awesome or deeply disturbing.

Sparkle climbed in but got stuck there. He managed to roll around and distract Rudolf who was coming to see what the fuss was.<br><br>There were several incidents with Tinkerbell, another slave. Porky had designs on her but she was less than impressed with his present of wine and assaulted him with an Absinthe bottle and whilst he was unconcious dressed him up like a fairy. When the elves were in their dorm she hid in the rafters and heard their plans. They tried to stop her from telling Santa but she escaped through a hole in the roof unfortunately made by Porky.<br/><br/>It's quite strange running SaJ, especially when you're sitting in the next room just watching TV as everyone else spends 20 minutes or so deciding on their goals and having a fun time. But then when you get going it pretty much runs itself. I only had to start two scenes, the first one and the one with Michael Winner whom I'd noticed was an enemy on Minger's character sheet.<br/><br/>I suppose the only danger is that it turn into My Life with Master, and to be honest, it did a bit. But then I expect they often do ressemble each other. MLwM is more structured and this gives the GM a slightly better idea of how to run the game but SaJ allows for many different kinds of story. I think I'd like to play it at a less hectic pace where the goals of the characters are more restrained and more human.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184508/#Comment_184508" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T10:01:32+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 10:01AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: trzy worki cementu</cite><strong>I generally think people take Steal Away Jordan too seriously.
