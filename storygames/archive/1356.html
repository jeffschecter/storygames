                    This is a fragment inspired by a few recent threads, notably <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1341&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">I Want to Learn from You</a>. It also springboards off Best Friends.<br/><br/>For each other character, your character has a statement chosen from a list like:<br/><br/>* "I resent X for his/her Y."<br/>* "I'm irritated by X's Y."<br/>* "I envy X his/her Y."<br/>* "I admire X for his/her Y."<br/><br/>(Where X is the other character, obviously, and Y is an attribute of that character.)<br/><br/>By making these statements, you are implicitly saying, "X has attribute Y", or rather, "my character perceives X to have attribute Y" (which is not always the same thing), and how you feel about that.<br/><br/>You're also implicitly saying, "My character perceives him/herself to lack attribute Y", which may be untrue. Probably more interesting if it is. In fact, make that a rule: <b>Y is an attribute that your character has, but doesn't know/admit he/she has</b>.<br/><br/>You are also defining something in the space between the characters: The relationship is characterized by my character's resentment/irritation/envy/admiration for attribute Y in X.<br/><br/>Now, if you can combine that with Tony's idea of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1346" rel="nofollow">internal and external conflicts to define the situation</a>, and maybe <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1325" rel="nofollow">key chains</a>, and optionally <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1323" rel="nofollow">character reboots every session</a> (another TonyLB inspiration), you may just have struck gold. That may be all the character/situation definition you need to get a stunning game started, one that will pile awesomeness upon rockosity.<br/><br/>I'm releasing this one into the wild for anyone to pick up who wants it - I won't have time to work on it for a while. Of course, by posting it here I'm implicitly saying "Anyone can have it", but I want to remove the other usual implication: "but I'm going to be doing something with it".                </div>

                            In one of the early incarnations of Misery Bubblegum, I required that each player answer the following things about their character:<br/><br/>(1) What goal are you pursuing?<br/>(2) Why is it uniquely important to your character to achieve this goal?  (So no "I want to be King!" only "I want to be King so my no-good stinking brother will have to bow to me!")<br/>(3) Who, simply by being the person they are, prevents you from achieving that goal?<br/><br/>It was the one piece of that system that worked.

                            It occurs to me that this I (feeling) (character) for their (property) would make an awesome pile of cards for a crossover type game. <br/><br/>Draw (feeling), (character), (property) and place in front of you. That's your character. They're in (situation) with everybody else. In front of you you have a series of (character developments positive and negative) in a path. You're trying to get down to the last one, your character's chosen resolution.<br/><br/>But other players are providing adversity by adding cards, swapping them round and generally monkeying with the stack. <br/><br/>That'd be quite cool. I shall ponder this more.                        </div>

                            Parallel evolution, Matt, I was thinking of something very similar this morning. <br/><br/>Maybe 6 colours for 6 feelings/attitudes - either pre-assigned (green = envy, etc.) or assignable per game.<br/><br/>Perhaps a 6-sided die with the colours.<br/><br/>Hexes or squares in the colours, creating the board as you play.<br/><br/>Colours are internal conflicts, something else (shapes? pips?) relates to external conflicts, with a separate die, so you get mix-and-match.<br/><br/>A picture of the character indicates which character the relationship applies to.<br/><br/>The properties/attributes could be chosen at the beginning of each game, thus giving "rebootability". You would probably also generate new ones in the course of play.<br/><br/>Actually you could probably do something like this with a six-suit <a href="http://www.piecepack.org/" rel="nofollow">piecepack</a>, with the suits instead of the colours for internal conflicts and the values for the external conflicts. That's something else I've thought of doing (using a piecepack as the basis for a storygame). <br/><br/>I already have two games that I've written that are sitting waiting for playtest, so I don't really want to add a third one. But it may have its own mental momentum.                        </div>

                            At the moment I'm thinking that "how I feel about it" comes in six pairs of negative/positive represented by colours:<br/><br/>Purple = Angry/resentful vs grateful<br/>Blue = Sad/hurt vs happy/healed<br/>Green = Envious/jealous vs glad for<br/>Yellow = Scared/intimidated vs trusting<br/>Orange = Disgusted/repelled vs attracted to<br/>Red = Guilty/ashamed vs proud/admiring<br/><br/>As to whether these colours are on a board, dice, tokens, pawns, several or all of the above - I currently have no idea.                        </div>

This uses all the dice (etc.) that have been built up in a big, extended battle that goes on for some time, and its outcome is to transform the character's situation. Mechanically, the dice become their opposite.<br/><br/><b>Falling Action:</b> The polarity of the dice now reversed, the tragic hero begins to have things go badly, and the comic hero to have them go well, as they deal with the aftermath of the outcome of the climax. The outcome of the conflict has led to self-discovery, revealing to the character that he or she has the quality L.<br/><br/><b>Denoument:</b> As a result of the foregoing, one or more of A-J is changed permanently, or at least put into abeyance.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't just the structure of a story arc, it's also the structure of a character arc. And if I can figure out how to have it happening for multiple characters at the same time...<br/><br/>I'll know more than I know now.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Fred. Looking forward to those Amber rules ever more eagerly!<br/><br/>Driving home last night I figured it out - the whole thing is fractal. Self-similar at multiple levels. The story arcs, the character arcs, the various kinds of conflicts, even the charging and discharging of the dice all follow the same 5-part structure.<br/><br/>What's more, the elements are neurons. It's a neural network (kind of like Verge). They have thresholds; they build up to those thresholds and then they discharge. And they have links between them so the effects flow from one to another, more strongly through the ones that are more strongly linked.<br/><br/>Any story element external to the characters is (TonyLB inspiration) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun" rel="nofollow">Chekhov's Gun</a>. It's introduced (exposition). The players validate it as interesting and this makes it important, so it reappears (rising action). Upon its reappearance it is "loaded", so when it reappears again it will be "fired" (climax). This leads to consequences (falling action) and brings about some change (denoument).<br/><br/>Mechanical details to follow.                        </div>

                            One thing I've been thinking about here (admittedly in a Best Friends/Amber kitbash sort of way) is the idea that people get to learn what emotions people have for them, but not *why*.<br/><br/>Let's say I'm playing Caine.  Consider, if I said something like this, when speaking of my character's attitudes towards Benedict:<br/><br/><i>I envy Benedict for his skill at arms.<br/>I love Benedict for his familial loyalty.<br/>I resent Benedict for his position of power.</i><br/><br/>This is what I'd know, and it would inevitably color conflicts with Benedict where skill at arms, familial loyalty, or position of power was a deciding factor (whether through Best Friends style push mechanics, or something else).<br/><br/>But the GM (or whoever -- an external, impartial type) tallies up the data for Benedict's sheet, and doesn't let Benedict know who contributed to his stats (or however that works; again, using Best Friends as a touchpoint).  But he does give Benedict *partial* information.  What he learns is:<br/><br/><i>Caine envies, loves, and resents you.</i><br/><br/>I think there's something festive to be had here.  By understanding the emotional qualities of Caine's attitudes towards Benedict, Benedict's player understands some of the textures of the relationship.  That's something to play off of.  But, by keeping Caine's *reasons* secret from Benedict's player, there's some surprise and discovery and 'what conflicts will his love come into, and what conflicts will bring the resentment to the surface?' to it that -- at least for a 'competitive atmosphere' setting like Amber, I particularly like.                        </div>

                            Great comments, guys, thanks. Fred (Iago), I did mean to address the what-the-others-know thing at some point but hadn't done it yet - that's a good approach.<br/><br/>One possible physical/mechanical implementation: <br/><br/>All elements are written on small cards. An element is a character; a character's stereotype; a quality of a character such as an attribute, ability or resource; a physical or conceptual feature of the setting; or a real or possible circumstance.<br/><br/>Elements have thresholds from 1 to 5, assigned when they are created. The player creating them can reduce the threshold from the default 6 by paying tokens from an initial pool. <br/><br/>Each player who wants to do so can make their own card for any element introduced into narrative by anyone and reduce its threshold individually, so that the total investment of the group in that element may be greater than what is reflected on any one card.<br/><br/>Reducing the threshold reflects the strength of the character's emotional investment in the element. The number of tokens spent should be reflected in the player's narration by choice of words, e.g. if you are spending purple tokens you can say "I am irritated aboutâ€¦" (1 token), "I am annoyedâ€¦" (2), "vexed" (3), "angry" (4), "furious" (5). The threshold is marked on the card with a colour corresponding to the tokens spent and an indication of "positive" or "negative" emotion.<br/><br/>The lower the threshold, the more easily the element is "loaded" or "fired". <br/><br/>If something occurs in the narrative which relates to the element, this loads or fires it.<br/><br/>It is loaded if it isn't currently loaded, and is fired if it is currently loaded. Elements created at the beginning of the game can be pre-loaded from an initial pool.<br/><br/>An element is loaded by adding six-sided dice to it, reflecting the level of engagement of the character(s) with the element in the context in which it is introduced. You can load the element with up to (6 â€“ threshold) dice "for free" but must pay tokens to exceed this. <br/><br/>If the supply of dice is limited for some reason, you can place tokens from the spent-tokens pool on the card instead and just use the equivalent number of dice when you come to fire the element.<br/><br/>When the element is loaded, narrate how the introduction of the element stirred emotion of the appropriate type (assuming you currently have narration rights).<br/><br/>Once an element is loaded, next time it occurs one of three things can happen: <br/><br/>1.	If the holder of the card considers its significance in the scene to equal the threshold, by paying tokens equal in number to the threshold they can fire the element (see below). <br/>2.	If the holder does not consider it adequately significant to fire, they may alternatively spend tokens to add a number of dice less than the threshold (which must not cause the total to exceed six). <br/>3.	If the holder considers its significance to exceed the threshold, they spend tokens equal to the perceived significance. Any tokens in excess of the threshold are converted into bonus dice, and the element is fired.<br/><br/>Firing an element involves rolling the dice. Any die showing a value above the threshold is a success and is retained on the card for the next time; the other dice are removed from the card.<br/><br/>If two elements occur in the same scene together they receive a link, indicated by a line drawn between them (alternatively, write the name of the other element on the card which links to it/from it). Links can have positive or negative polarity, appropriate to the context in which they co-occurred. Indicate this by marking "+" or "-" beside the line. If the two elements co-occur again in a subsequent scene, add a mark to the line to indicate a further occurrence (easier than drawing another line).<br/><br/>Any links existing at the beginning of a scene (i.e. not created as a consequence of the scene) can act as "overflow channels" for the dice which had a value below the threshold. Odd dice flow down negative links, even dice down positive links. If there is no room for them on the immediately connected card, dice may flow across it and down another link (of appropriate polarity) to a third card, but no further. ("No room" means that adding further dice to the card would take it over its maximum, which is either six or the threshold, whichever is higher.)<br/><br/>Of the dice which remain on the card after below-threshold results are removed, even die results reinforce the character's attitude as depicted on the card, odd die results contradict it. Mechanically, subtract odds from evens; if the result is positive, reduce the threshold by that number of points, if negative, increase the threshold by that number of points. <br/><br/>If the threshold is reduced to zero the card is set aside, and if it is to be used again it must be reactivated as if it were being introduced for the first time. <br/><br/>If the threshold becomes negative, the polarity of the card switches; a positive attitude becomes negative and vice versa.<br/><br/>If the threshold increases the player receives tokens of the appropriate colour to a number equal to the increase.<br/><br/>Narrate the change of attitude of the character as reflected by the shift in threshold, if any.<br/><br/>Note: All of the above is independent of any conflict resolution or action resolution taking place in the game itself. The system is solely concerned with the character's feelings, rather than "objective" events in the shared imaginative space. In this way it forms a "parasystem" which could be used in other games.<br/><br/>(The problem with this is that some outcomes, for example a conflict resolution where the character is successful but the change in emotion is towards greater negativity, may take a lot of creativity to narrate convincingly. The benefit is exactly the same as the problem.)                        </div>

Oh, this is sweet.  It won't fit in my current rules, but it's nifty.                        </div>

Annnd, because I <i>never</i> tire of pimping non-violent communication, which says, hey, <i>emotions</i> are a <i>signalling system</i> for the all-important, universal <i>needs</i>:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.cnvc.org/feelings.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cnvc.org/feelings.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.cnvc.org/needs.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cnvc.org/needs.htm</a><br/><br/>(I personally think one could do a pretty nice motivation simulator by just putting down a character's prominent needs, what feelings they usually use to signal them, and a few neurotic triggers that activate non-adaptive ways to try to meet those needs. Hours of drama, as the triggered reactions futher trigger reactions from other characters! Somewhat boringly Simmy to my tastes but potentially educational; or maybe useful in a computer "rpg" system.)<br/><br/>--JB                        </div>

                            The thread from gladen/Victor Amato about his <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1553" rel="nofollow">task resolution mechanics question</a> gave me some ideas. These aren't answers to Victor's question, by the way, they're just ideas for my stuff sparked by his question.<br/><br/>The dice you have invested in an element constitute a pool (inspiration <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> from Victor). When a conflict comes up, you roll the dice from those elements which are related to the conflict. <br/><br/>You have separate ability scores running 1 to 5. This is your target number - anything less than or equal to it is a success.<br/><br/>Compare your successes to the opposing dice. Remove as many dice as match on both sides, by number, starting with the lowest. Stop once you reach the lower target number between the two sides.<br/><br/>Count the remaining dice. This gives the conflict outcome.<br/><br/>Thus combining task resolution and conflict resolution (inspiration <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> from Victor).<br/><br/>I think breadth (the number of matching results you rolled) should have an effect as well, and that this effect should be one thing for dice which were successes and another thing for ones that were failures, but I'm not sure what the effect is yet.                        </div>
