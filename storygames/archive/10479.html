Who's played it?

As you use your skills, if you roll a certain number, they go up. The traits are very evocative of the setting. The special powers are fun (like curving bullets and hitting multiple targets). You can blow up terrain. I like how stealth works. Bantering is fun. I like the abstract use of maps and damage saves over hit points. We only played probably 30% of the game. I've heard many of the subsystems are fun, including hacking and rigging. Some of the traits require you to make sound effects to use them. It's also a very hackable game. My only complaints from my limited experience with the game was that bantering is very important but only characters with high will can consistent receive its benefit. So a high attack character sacrificing their attack at a thin chance of a successful banter can be slightly dissatisfying.The game is very much D&amp;D4E meets Burning Wheel meets savage worlds with super fast combat. You can also play multiple characters, command armies, and play a superhero level character along side a sidekick with little problem.<br><br>I have not fully read the book and had someone teach me the rules so I can't comment on the game text. <br/><br/>And I think Amy is awesome.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232912/#Comment_232912" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T18:18:54+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  6:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's fantasy and sci-fi yet the battles are still gritty.  I like the built-in system for taking over way-points (basically large scale combat to conquer cities) and I absolutely love the sandbox emulation of the setting.  I love the random encounter charts and time lapse chart.  The fact that my players are currently on a mission two way-points from their home base and when they return it could be in the Legion's hands is fantastic and magical.  <br/><br/>My only problems with the game was the anime art-work which I'm not a fan of that style (the art-work is pretty good for that style however).  So, I printed out pictures of Warhammer Beastmen to use as Bruta and a War-Boar to take the place of a Duar.  We also altered how the Gaera look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamergirl" title="gamergirl"><img alt="gamergirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamergirl">gamergirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233008/#Comment_233008" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T10:15:45+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 10:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't had a chance to play it yet, however from reading the text, it appears to be written extremely well.   Clint Krause did an amazing job on the layout as well the the technical writing and flavor text in the book.  I love the concepts that jenskot mentioned in his post, and would agree that its a combination of 4E, Burning Wheel, and Savage Worlds.   One of my favorite aspects of it has to do with the way you increase your skill.  So even if you aren't that great at a skill, you can increase it through the mechanics.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a big fan of the anime style art work either.  This game feels a lot gritty than the art work seems to express.  It's great art-work, I just don't feel like it fits the game as well as another style would.  Some of the pieces to me look a little rushed and not as clean as others. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking forward to getting my full box set when ever they go back up on IPR. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see that Amy (the illustrator) is currently the one who is selling the game.  Has anyone heard what the designer Clint Krause is currently working on?  I have his other games (which are as awesome as this one).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233071/#Comment_233071" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T14:12:48+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  2:12PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unique Traits make it sweet - Each PC can have one (and only one).

Empire of Dust makes it work with the aforementioned Unique Traits, which let you define yourself in relation to one of those super-cool NPCs. You can be the lover who made the cool/beautiful renegade angel* commit adultery against her husband (God, btw) because she loved you so much. Or you can be the personal pet of the sexy drug addicted super bitch that runs the empire of evil. Or you can be the dude that God (an actual NPC, not a cosmic theory) has tasked with BLOWING UP THE WORLD. <br/><br/>The nifty thing about it is that it lets the campaign have some cool NPCs that could easily have gone Mary Sue, or just disconnected from the PCs, and makes sure that they'll be tied tightly with the concept of whichever character takes the trait. <br/><br/><br/>*Not really an angel, but lets go with the easy definition for the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233174/#Comment_233174" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T07:26:33+00:00" title="September 19, 2009  7:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What makes it sweet?

What really struck me was the introduction, which talked about making your character like an 'action figure' and being completely unapologetic about 'game balance' and 'min-maxing'. That kind of viewpoint is refreshing. The unique traits, as well as the vague, but evocative setting are also big pluses in my book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have very mixed feelings regarding the art. Some of the pieces (particularly "the Widow") look really professional, but others seem quite rushed, or strangely proportioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I would love to hear about more people's experiences with this game.
