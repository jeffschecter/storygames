Note also the subtle distinction between this kind of thing and adventure hooks- these aren't full on session worthy ideas, just things to drive maybe a scene or two, and sure, when stung together they can make an adventure, but on their own they really aren't.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is that I think more games should put more thought into their "sample challenges", "sample story elements", or yes "sample monsters" or whatever section, because I think that it's just the sort of creativity aide that drives people to start thinking about and getting excited about GMing and consequently gets games actually started. <br/><br/>Anyways, discuss.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236526/#Comment_236526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T06:35:10+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  6:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Slime Story will have a selection of 40 or 50 monsters in the book, but then hunting monster is so central to the premise that you couldn't actually play it without them.<br/><br/>Not every game needs pre-made challanges/monsters/whatevers of course, but where there'd be no point for In a Wicked Age, it feels like BESM kind of leaves the GM high and dry. I do like having that kind of stuff available, both for helping come up with ideas and using in play. Yuuyake Koyake (a Japanese RPG about cute magical animals helping out ordinary people in rural Japan) is great in this respect since it includes stats for different kinds people and local gods, and then gives you a bunch of "story fragments" for each one, so that the chapter on NPCs is just bursting with story ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236536/#Comment_236536" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T07:21:16+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  7:21AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko has the principle point right, I think: a lot of SGs come with situation generators, or do prep at the table. As such, one can provide examples, Oracles, and even ready-to-run towns, but in the end it's a player product.<br/><br/>That said, I am not making an SG, so I fully intend to provide GMs with all sorts of ideas for LARP plot lines, challenges, and situation hooks along with practical advice about preparing, set-dressing, prop-making, dealing with Host officials, etc. I'll have several ready-to-run genre write-ups (i.e. settings without Figures of Note but with plenty of Archetypes) and examples of Abilities and such-like, to hopefully inspire ideas for WHAT to run. But LARPs being very different from table top, their planners and players benefit a lot from real world, logistical advice about HOW to run.<br/><br/>I do, however, find it odd that more RPGs don't provide such advice for the table top world; for example:<br/>* Preparing a play space - round table or board-room-long? Space for maps and minis or spreading out index cards? General notes about focus and visibility.<br/>* Necessary equipment - number of dice (a particular confusion with VB games, I find). Useful reference sheets for at the table. Additional play aides (e.g. D&amp;D's marks--there must be fifty ways to do it, now; were any in the DMG?).<br/>* Time issues - pacing play; how long is a tight versus loose session? How long is a first session, including teaching?<br/>* Pedagogy - best practice for teaching; progressions for introducing system complexity (or expansion of options--whatever; that's an old thread). (Many game actually do this well; it's become a recent focus for Best practices for rule book organization.)<br/><br/>Now, maybe folks think players should just "figure that out," but I recall a number of forum threads on the Net which began by asking one or more of those questions. LARPs, being relatively expensive to run as compares to a tabletop, certainly require this sort of up-front thinking and organization, if only to maximize (limited) play time and minimize expenses for record keeping, props and sets, and site use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236546/#Comment_236546" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T07:45:33+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  7:45AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's make one.
