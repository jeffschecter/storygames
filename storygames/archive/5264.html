But now I'm interested in doing one!  Especially one in which my work receives feedback and criticism from fellow competitors and more experienced shamans.<br/><br/>I seem to believe that there is a seasonality to these contests - the big ones (Game Chef) appear to be annual.  When's the next one?<br/>Where do I look for details or watch for announcements?<br/>Any specific ideas for someone who's not done a whole game design before?<br/><br/>Thanks very much for any pointers.<br/><br/>-Jason                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118686/#Comment_118686" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T00:08:32+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 12:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I seem to believe that there is a seasonality to these contests - the big ones (Game Chef) appear to be annual.

I think Kevin Allen Jr was planning a Reversed Engineer contest around, well, now.\n<blockquote>Where do I look for details or watch for announcements?</blockquote>\nHere! Andy, who moderates this forum, runs Game Chef. Try <a href="http://www.game-chef.com/" rel="nofollow">Game Chef</a>, too.\n<blockquote>Any specific ideas for someone who's not done a whole game design before?</blockquote>\nIt's a great opportunity to get peer feedback. Write a game you'd want to play, rather than a game you think is "good". Don't worry about winning the contest or the scores: it's about the feedback and the challenge.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118707/#Comment_118707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T04:32:23+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  4:32AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think everyone approaches contests in different ways (or, well, doesn't approach them at all, which is cool, too).  But it has to be a personal thing with meaning for you, because you won't win, and your game will be half-baked, and you might not get any useful criticism.  So with that as a set of ridiculous benchmarks, just be clear about your own goals.  I find the artificial constraints spur my creativity and, despite my expectations, I often get really useful feedback.  Reading, playing, and commenting on other people's work is also very inspirational and rewarding.  Half-baked stuff I do for contests often worms its way into more serious projects.  <br/><br/>Game Chef is a great way to get your feet wet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118732/#Comment_118732" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T07:08:45+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  7:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>But it has to be a personal thing with meaning for you, because you won't win, and your game will be half-baked, and you might not get any useful criticism.

Otherwise, Game Chef is annual (coming up in March/April or so), there's also the 24 Hour RPG challenge which you can conceivably engage in at any time. Also, there's a ton of challenges buried in these forums which are still valid (choose a competitor, and co-write games, etc), try the Advanced Search and search thread titles for "challenge" or "contest".<br/><br/>I'm currently waffling on what to do about this year's Game Chef. Since we've had an awesome universe-like explosion of all sorts of ideas in all sorts of directions, I'm thinking that this year I want to try to roll things back to something traditional, perhaps even utilizing the theme constraints and rules constraints that were really successful some 2-3 years ago. I'm definitely going to take it further in a direction of "No Real Winner". That is, putting more into the feedback part of the contest (perhaps increasing participation level somehow), while completely killing the "To WIN!!!" aspect.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118761/#Comment_118761" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T08:52:28+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  8:52AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Andy, can we have one of those threads where we give you lots of ideas for Game Chef?
