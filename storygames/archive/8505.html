Normally, I only do RPGs with my two best friends, and while this is great in some circumstances, there are some games that just don't work that well with only 2 players, and I'm always interested in introducing new people to new games.<br/><br/>Only one of these people is currently doing any gaming of the RPG variety, and he's playing in a D&amp;D 3.5 game.  I think the other 3 have all played an RPG at one point or another, but not for several years.  They all seem to be pretty willing to give something a shot, however.<br/><br/>So: any suggestions on what I should try with them?<br/>I've been thinking of something slightly more "traditional" and possibly a bit competitive.<br/>I thought first I might try something that's easy to get started quickly, possibly <i>Agon</i> or <i>In a wicked age</i>, maybe <i>3:16</i>.<br/>If they're interested in something more involved, I was thinking of maybe <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, <i>REIGN</i>, or <i>Weapons of the Gods</i>  Once I get my hard copy of <i>Mouse Guard</i> I'll probably want to try it out too, though I'm not sure whether any of these guys would be into playing a game about mice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188535/#Comment_188535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T16:05:30+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  4:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard would be a terrific "welcome back to gaming" game. Emphasize the realistic-low-fantasy-due-to-scale angle, not the anthropomorphic angle.<br/><br/>Reign's not bad, but not as light/easy as it looks. There's also quite a lot of trad-style GM prep involved.<br/><br/>3:16 is terrific beer-and-pretzels, but provides very, very little to grab onto for an inexperienced gamer. I had a similar issue among some players with Lacuna.<br/><br/>On that note, InSpectres is a tried-and-true intro game. We've used it here to jump in new players.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188537/#Comment_188537" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T16:15:39+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  4:15PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paul!  I should say that I don't really need feedback on (most of) the games I actually mentioned because (aside from Mouse Guard and Houses of the Blooded) I've had them all in my possession for awhile and have either played them myself or at least read them quite a bit.<br/><br/>I'm probably not really that inclined to try REIGN, but the upside of it is that it's pretty trady in many ways, so a lot of it would be familiar, at least stylistically.  And if I did it, I'd probably try to do it in a semi competitive way, having the PCs belong to multiple Companies that are working against each other, rather than everyone being on one team.<br/><br/>What do you mean 3:16 provides "little to grab onto"?  I'm not necessarily disagreeing... I just don't really know what you mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188561/#Comment_188561" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T19:47:54+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  7:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also don't know about 3:16 offering little to grab onto, I ran it successfully with a group of people who had never played any table top games other than a handful of D&amp;D games and they got along just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
