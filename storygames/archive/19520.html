It looks pretty cool. I'm thinking of running it and I want to brainstorm with y'all.<br/><br/><b>My design goals</b>\n<ol><li>Entertain a half dozen or so players for a few months. The players won't all be local to me.<br/></li><li>If that works out, expand: more players, more months or years.<br/></li><li>Do all of that without a huge amount of GMing burden: a couple hours a week, tops.<br/></li><li>Use <i>Dynasty</i> to do some setting building for my "New Rome" SF setting, which I'll eventually use to run typical (non-Dynasty) games of Traveller.</li></ol>\n<b>My plan</b><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Invite five players to start</span>. Each will create a dynasty set in near-future Earth at the advent of the discovery of FTL travel. I'll use a wiki to record the basic rules and procedures. A player who wants to fine-tune the creation of her dynasty will need to purchase the rules, but a player without the rules can just give me parameters and I'll stat up the dynasty for her. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collect orders from players</span>. Players will submit orders via email once per week. I'll review orders and correspond to clear up issues. At the week's end, I'll interpret the orders and apply the <i>Dynasty</i> rules, and post the final orders and the resolution on a public wiki page. No secrets. (Nothing can be kept secret reliably for 30 years, anyway.) <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adjudicate orders simply, according to the <i>Dynasty</i> rules</span>. The responses will be terse and simple, not storytelling. Each player is responsible for taking the GM responses and writing up history on the wiki. This will likely entail creating new wiki pages for organizations, people, events, stars and planets, technology and science discoveries, and so on. Players are given wide latitude to invent stuff pertaining to their orders and the responses.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Encourage "New Rome"</span>. I ultimately want to create my New Rome SF setting, but I hate railroading. I'll handle this in two ways. First, I will reserve an NPC dynasty for New Rome itself. I can play it as a competitor, but I have to be careful not to stomp on other players as if it's a GMPC or something. Second, I will offer small bonuses to die rolls for players whose orders align with certain, well-published themes. Application of those bonuses will be published with the order resolution, so everyone will know who got the bonus and why. <br/><br/>I'll probably also give some kind of small bonus for creating interesting wiki pages related to one's orders.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Every month or so, introspect</span>. If I have the bandwidth as GM, add another player. Replace players lost due to attrition. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Repeat for a while</span>. See how it goes. <br/><br/><br/><b>Feedback</b><br/>Does this seem feasible? I don't have a ton of free time but I can eke out a couple hours once a week to process orders and if I'm late, I can just start the next 7-day order submission period late and publish the revised schedule in the latest order resolution posts.<br/><br/>Is there anything I should do differently?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434054/#Comment_434054" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T02:59:22+00:00" title="June 19, 2014  2:59AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi<br/>I'd suggest you need a strong and explicit strategy to deal with unsubmitted orders. These will inevitably occur given life, timeframes etc. You don't want to halt/slow the game for this.<br/>Also " I'll review orders and correspond to clear up issues. " sounds like a lot of work. Best to just interpret and apply the results as you see fit. Any confusion caused is just modelling real-world issues that are not otherwise modelled. This also implies that having a strong template for orders could help (I'm not familiar with the product).<br/>Finally suggest you check out Pocket Empires for T4, sounds like an inspiration for Dynasty.<br/>rgds<br/>rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434088/#Comment_434088" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T21:17:06+00:00" title="June 19, 2014  9:17PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2014 9:17PM by zircher.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call there.  Back last millennium, I was involved in the design/running/playing of a PBEM space empire game and missed deadlines was always a hassle.  Contingency orders is one way to handle it, "let it ride" and use the same orders where feasible is another, for moderated games - "just wing it" is actually a valid (if costly in time) approach where you let the GM handle it.  Depending on the game, having an alternate player is an option, especially if you have a vacation or temporary duty assignment coming up.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434091/#Comment_434091" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T23:50:31+00:00" title="June 19, 2014 11:50PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok so maybe you have those options right there in the dynasty definition sheet...<br/><br/>IN CASE OF MISSED DEADLINE:<br/>[ ] Contingency Orders: ________________________________________________________<br/>[ ] Continue in Same Vein/Direction/Mode<br/>[ ] Allow GM to Make Decisions for my Dynasty<br/>[ ] Allow Alternate Player to Make Decisions for my Dynasty<br/><br/>It is mandatory to choose one, but you can change it at any time.

I'd add this to the order template, as well, so they could override it for just one order.<br/><br/>robb, good advice about avoiding back-and-forth correspondence to interpret orders. However, I feel like there could be some drama when I interpret an order incorrectly and the player feels that it's my fault, not theirs. That puts me in the position of wanting to retcon a resolution, etc. Maybe that's still easier, though. Dunno.<br/><br/>Another way I could handle missed orders:<br/><br/>1. Every week, you earn one Action Point.<br/>2. At any time, spend one Action Point to submit a single order, up to a maximum of (say) THREE per week.<br/>3. The GM interprets all orders submitted that week as if they all occurred in the current game time period.<br/><br/>There's some strategy here allowing a player to give up orders up front and save them for a surge of action later. In a PvP game, this might be too much. I don't envision this entirely as a PvP game, but it could turn out that way.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434104/#Comment_434104" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T09:38:12+00:00" title="June 20, 2014  9:38AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds feasible.  (And pretty neat!)  But unless the Dynasty rules and the kinds of turns that get submitted are tightly constrained, two hours to process sounds optimistic.  Maybe if you read all the submitted turns and then just wait a couple days, while it rolls around in the back of your head, by the time you sit down to write up results, it'll be faster.<br/><br/>Are the players all real friends or just peeps on the internet?  Particularly if the latter, have a second avenue of contact for each player.  You said turns will be by email, so that's the default.  But be able to G+/Facebook/text/other email/phone people too.  When they disappear, you won't want to just dump them, you'll want to be able to ask them what's up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434109/#Comment_434109" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T14:47:48+00:00" title="June 20, 2014  2:47PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some players are local friends.
