                            I think it's very possible to run many, many different kinds of game this way!<br/><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like what you're enamored by is way that game structure and commitment to using prep, procedure, and random tables before resorting to improv make the game feel concrete, real, solid?<br/><br/>The structure, prep, procedure, and tables don't have to be about overland and dungeon exploration.<br/><br/>Say you want a moody vampire game.<br/><br/>Structure could be based around the sleep/wake/feed cycle.<br/><br/>Prep could be centered on high-level territory maps of a city, and relationship maps between the vampires and major mortals in the city.<br/><br/>Procedure could be built around the hunting process, and the court etiquette of vampire-kind.<br/><br/>Tables could generate prey, hunting events, and disruptions to the uneasy truce between the vampires in the city.<br/><br/>And we can run it all with the same fanatical devotion to objectivity.<br/><br/>EDIT: I also think you've probably missed some important details if her style seems to you like a video game with a human computer. That phrasing makes it seem like, Idunno, the players only engage with the world through the game mechanics. That's probably pretty far off base! The point is to ensure that, as much as possible, <i>important facts about the world are not chosen arbitrarily by the GM during play</i>. Which is pretty orthogonal to the means by which players address the world and situation.                        </div>

                            I think anything can be approached in a sandboxy way if you have enough setting material.  That material could be pre-written, like an established setting from literature or a published world atlas/sourcebook, or it could be procedural, like a big mess of Arduin tables or <i>Vornheim</i>.  Or a mixture of the two, like the city of <i>Sanctuary</i>.<br/><br/>Some games are designed to accommodate whole existing settings from other media: I believe <i>Questlandia</i> and <i>Archipelago</i> both explicitly talk about this (and they are both examples of very "storygamey" games).  Narrative-oriented games may often tend toward an arc that suggests closure at the end of a session or series of sessions, but you can always think of a clever way to pick up those characters (or related ones) and continue.  What you end up with tends to be "episodic" (in the TV sense), and "campaigns" are like "seasons," which is pretty cool.  :-)                        </div>

                            Forbidden Lands, by Fria Ligan games, may be very much what you seek, OP. It's not "trad" in any meaningful sense of the word I know: there's a GM, but they are very much bound by the rules, and there is some story-gamey flagging stuff. There's a very definite setting, one that the PCs learn about along with their characters.<br/><br/>It *is* traditional in its content: the PCs are adventurers (not necessarily heroes; the game is sort of... agnostic on that point in a way that reminds me of Apocalypse World*), it's a fantasy game, there are swords and monsters and spells and demons and etc.<br/><br/>Exploration is put front and center with this whole map thing: you put stickers on it to denote areas your PCs have explored, and it sounds like that will really create a living world feel to it. I've even been told that if I run a one-shot or whatever, to just drop the stickers on the map anyway, and then if I get a full campaign going, what happened in the one-shot is still canon. In a sense it lets you create a one-(or more!)-GM, many players kind of living world.<br/><br/>I dropped $100 on the very pretty boxed set and am itching to try it out, which I believe I will be doing soon!<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>My friend <a href="/forums/profile/StoneTharp">@StoneTharp</a> ran Mythras (RuneQuest 6) in what we called a "relationship sandbox" style; the game was also "anthropological roleplaying." There was a somewhat predefined setting, but we deepened the in-game cultures through portraying and exploring them, and while exploring the physical setting mattered (a ton!), there was a reason we called it a relationship sandbox. Navigating through the various lines of family, clan, religion, alliances, etc. was just as important as the physical orienteering through the wilderness. The game rules did somewhat facilitate this, though if you end up going with RQ6 / Mythras I'd recommend talking to me about the house-rules we used...                        </div>

There are lots of PbtA games. Some might be “sandbox” and some might not.<br/><br/>The way I’ve seen AW run, it often starts as “we come up with the world together as a group” (using all the techniques described in the book), and then sometimes transitions into a fairly “sandbox”-like format. (Except the threats are typically more proactive than in a “there’s an adventure over here”-style D&amp;D game.)<br/><br/> </div>

                            Games with player-facing sandbox systems:<br/><br/>Blades in the Dark: the players can choose scores off a Claims sheet.  ("Oh, if we nab this piece of turf, we could do another heist and seize a drug den.")  The scores they choose can have emergent consequences (depending on which neighborhood they hit, they will lose status with a faction and risk going to war).<br/><br/>Undying: the R-map establishes a sandbox.  The players can take sides, collaborate, compete, etc.  This is more a drama sandbox than the exploration sandbox other games focus on.<br/><br/>Torchbearer: The ability to research and adventuring sites and listen to rumors lets players invest their success from one adventure into leverage in another.  The sandbox relies on the GM having multiple adventures prepped, so that PC investment in research/leads/rumors is well spent.  The game also supports sandbox play in that dungeons have an ecosystem rather than a set quest; sometimes a weary party just needs to tap out an move on.<br/> </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">But the question remains. Are there 'story game' sandboxs? Or are the concepts atithetical?</blockquote>
The short answer: no. People do their damnedest to dance around it, but you'll note that those who actually play full-blown sandboxes don't join the chorus.<br/><br/>I will <i>freely</i> admit that many games are not actively opposed to sandboxing, and that some games have some minor sandbox features. However, I feel that calling them sandbox games without qualification is completely disingenious.<br/><br/>However, regarding your next question: the only definition of the idea of story game that is outright antithetical to sandboxing is "drama game" - as in, a game that replicates dramatic storytelling. You probably understand the term in a sense that is much wider than that, though, and in general there is no contradiction: it is very much possible to develop a sandbox for something that you would probably call a story game.<br/><br/>I have some examples of games that are both powerfully sandboxing and probably story games - narrativist games with structural rules, for instance - but none that I can think of have been actually published.<br/><br/>For example, my friend Petteri has this game in development called <i>The Varangian Way</i>. Here is how it fulfills the requirement:<br/><br/><b>Sandbox:</b> The game begins with a player character party of Swedish vikings who explore the Eastern European waterways in hopes of trade and glory. Individual characters are relatively cheap, you are expected to develop a character stable. The party can and will split up, with some starting their own tradeposts alongside important waterways, or seizing thrones among the local peoples, or going back home to claim their birthright in Scandinavia. The game content is tracked on maps the players develop as play progresses; content is pushed by individual players (the game is GM-less) utilizing randomization procedures and arbitrary inspiration. Individual characters and parties are followed in parallel, as players please, as they delve into the landmass and perhaps discover the fabled Constantinople at some point.<br/><br/><b>Story game:</b> The overall goal of the game is to tell compacted slice of life stories about a varied ensemble cast of characters who live and die in the world of Ruthenian waterways, forests and steppe. Much of the lives of the characters is dealt with on a highly abstract level, time passes quickly and whole human lifetimes are potentially in play in terms of dramatic stakes. The core exploration activity in the game reveals a randomized, potentially fantastical and ahistorical Eastern Europe for interaction with civilized Europe; it is essentially a Western genre setup, except in 8th century European east. Furthermore, the heroically decisive actions of the main characters impact the socio-economic development of the entire Ruthenian region in the early medieval period, ultimately determining how state formation and political compromise between the local tribes works to create "a Russia" (in the sense of not necessarily being the Russian world we know).<br/><br/>So yeah, the idea is possible, it's just that I'm not aware of published game products that would really have the rubber hit the road in terms of sandboxing technique meeting story game artistic goals. The very least I'd expect for a game to be called a "sandbox" would be for the players, not the GM, to be in ultimate control of what content gets played and what is left as mere tantalizing potential. Ideally you'll have maps and stuff, too, of course, as part of an expansive world simulation.                        </div>

                            Oh, also, I just realized that the history of roleplaying actually knows of a few sandbox story games. It's just that they're so old that they slipped my mind just now. There are probably a few more, too, once you start thinking in these terms.<br/><br/>Both <i>Pendragon</i> and <i>Ars Magica</i> are clearly sandbox games (which I am willing to argue about, if somebody disagrees). They are also probably story games, unless your definition disqualifies 20th century games as a matter of course. Food for thought.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I agree with both Sandra and Eero here:<br/><br/>That’s why I said “depends on your definition”. I wouldn’t consider AW to be a sandbox game, but some would (many people play with maps and threats placed on the map, which the players can interact with however they like; they see the Fronts/Threats as enabling sandboxing). (I could write about why I don’t consider AW to work in this fashion, but that’s probably best left to another conversation - one aspect, though, is what Sandra said: the prep is not rigorous enough and impartial adjudication is very very difficult, at best.)<br/><br/>Similarly, Mutant Year Zero appears to be fairly clearly a sandbox game, but is it a story game? It’s somewhere in the middle ground. So it depends on your criteria.<br/><br/>In theory, I see no reason why a story gam couldn’t be a sandbox game. It just looks like no one’s really done that, at least not a rigorous fashion.<br/><br/>The implied question is: what does adding sandbox features to a story game add to the game? How does it improve things? <br/><br/>It looks like, so far, designers haven’t thought of any interesting answers to that question.                         </div>

                            That means that it doesn't qualify for "2097 style 'prepped&amp;explorable&amp;mutable'".<br/><br/>I love the game, it's just definitely not a "2097 style sandbox". In case that's what <a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">@Kenny_J</a> was asking for. AW is more iffy (leaning towards "not") but <i>Svart av kval, vit av lust</i> is <i>definitely</i> not. A key technique in "2097 style sandbox" is to precommit to facts that the other participants can try to deduce, discover, explore etc.<br/><br/>(The fact that it's an r-map instead of a location map isn't the problem.)<br/><br/>We often do <i>Svart av kval, vit av lust</i> style communal r-maps too but that part of the game isn't the sandboxy part.<br/><br/>Maybe I was dumb using a common word such as "sandbox". If only I had called it… "blorb".<br/><br/><i>Svart av kval, vit av lust</i> doesn't qualify as blorb. Neither does <i>Spirit of the Century</i>.<br/><br/><i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> does.                        </div>

                            I like the idea of sandbox as an <i>approach</i> rather than a <i>type</i>. That makes sense to me.
<blockquote>2097 said:<br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> He was specifically talking in comparison to PbtA <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></blockquote>
I wasn't meaning them as a comparison, just that I have switched play styles as of late, from playing and building in one world (how I played D&amp;D) to keeping the world un-prepped until we begin play (Apocalypse World and other Powered by the Apocalypse games). <br/><br/>Frankly I do this because I think it speaks equity of everyone's input. If I come to the table with my own ideas before anyone else gets a chance to input, then I am saying my ideas are more important than yours. If I did want to have a setting I would clear it with my fellow players beforehand.<br/><br/>As for MY definition of a "sandbox" or "story game," i deliberately kept it open to foster discussion (as I do). I mean I wasn't looking for a list of recommendations Per se, not that I am apposed to them either mind you.<br/><br/>To take a crack at the definitions though. I think Sandbox to me means a world players can explore. It shouldn't be made up on the spot, or at least not entirely. (I think there is room here for improvisation within the framework of pre-established material). It should feel like players can go anywhere. To me I was thinking location but I suppose a relationship map works the same. It should feel more like a simulation (I know that's a loaded term, but I mean it should feel real and consistent with limited pre-set outcomes) I struggling here to find the exact language I'm thinking.<br/><br/>(I love the term fish tank by the way <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> and thats a list I will have to check out.)<br/><br/>For Story game I go loose; Narrativist, drama game, tv show emulating, collaborative, somewhat broad to very broad player authorial input (both GM'd and GMless or full), generally get at my idea.                           </div>

                            I do think I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> here though (if I am reading him right) that prep is still prep if its done by everyone. It might make the world a little less mysterious, i.e. the other players wont be "Discovering" new uncharted lands if they helped come up with them. But that may not be a bad thing. You can always role play like you've never been. I guess that one depends on the group and their desired play style.                         </div>

                            I always thought of a sandbox as a style of gaming where we pretend that the world exists independent of the player characters and there is no specified story or quest that they're going on; if they don't like the situation they encounter in location A, they're free to ride down the road to location B, although there's no guarantee that things are better there.  If they poke around, there are lots of interesting situations to get mixed up in, but no overriding story like "the Gnoll King is gathering forces and you must find his hidden weakness before he overruns the lands of man".  So hexcrawls and West Marches type games are sandboxes, straight up dungeon delves are not, nor is something like Dragonlance. <br/><br/>I just don't see how you can call a game like Dogs in the Vineyard a sandbox in any meaningful sense -- it's got a very strong frame, all the PC's are Dogs, they go from town to town doing Dog stuff.  Sure, you could narrate a travelogue along the way or the player characters could abandon one town if it's too scary for them, but there's no sandbox there, they're either judging towns or they're not really playing the game.  That's like an anti-sandbox in my book. <br/>EDIT: I'm not trying to start a fight about the definition of "sandbox", just trying to figure out what people mean here, maybe there's whole other way of using the term. <br/><br/> </div>

Yep, that's what I meant with sandbox as an amusement park. There are a lot of rides, and the players can ride whatever seems interesting for them.<br/><br/>However, when I presented the <a href="http://gnomestew.com/game-mastering/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-an-intrigue/" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a>, some people have said "Well, that's just how I do my sandboxes" (not in the Gnome Stew articles though, elsewhere in forums).<br/><br/>I can in some way come to a sense that "the sandbox" is an umbrella term for this type of structure, where you explore certain things. For the amusement park, it's places with everything on it, and for the fish tank, it's the relations between factions that you explore.<br/><br/>Of course, it's possible to combine the fish tank and amusement park; just to confuse things even further.                        </div>

Discovering/exploring comes up in play, where people interpret the relationship map in different ways (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143/#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">social contingency</a> ftw!). Also, to kick things off, it's important to begin with a situation that removes the status quo. The exploration is then how the different characters with different agendas react to the new situation.<br/><br/>Later on, these reactions with create conflicts as agendas starts to collide, and the interesting part is to see what these conflicts leads to.                        </div>

                            I'm very glad to see the fishtank idea brought up; although it could be viewed as a kind of sandbox design, frankly I think of things like that as a "third way" that's neither sandbox nor railroad nor anywhere along the linear spectrum between them. I've often called the most obvious third way "relationship drama" ("blood opera" is often appropriate, although the term could easily apply to something nonviolent like the Jane Austen game).<br/><br/>There's this Burning Wheel scenario I co-designed a long time ago, that I've run like 15 times. It's a Three Musketeers thing, quite explicitly so, and the entire scenario is really just about the players' alliances and machinations with and against each other, often (but not always!) culminating in a swordfight between half-brothers. It would be impossible to characterize as either a railroad or a sandbox, and *much* of "indie RPGing" is similarly orthogonal to those concerns.<br/><br/>That all said, prep a big enough fishtank, and you could probably sustain a whole campaign in what I think of as "relationship sandbox" style, though IME you can't rely on the GM's prep to supply all the important details. In our Mythras game, for example, the players did do a fair amount of authoring, particularly of cultural details. We could possibly have used random tables for that purpose, but it might have hurt the anthropological feel of the game.<br/><br/>By the way, there's a cool trick from Beyond the Wall that's important to mention here. One of the historical problems in sandbox play is that the players may not be sufficiently invested in the world. (I know that, in theory, in OD&amp;D they're motivated by treasure, but IME that's often not enough, particularly for good roleplayers. Where by "good" I just mean, "able to develop a character's personal complexity.") When the entire world is a blank (to you, the player), it can simply be tough to develop much emotional attachment to all this stuff you're discovering.<br/><br/>In BtW, the players collaboratively add stuff to the map in Session Zero. But, the GM rolls secretly to see how accurate is their information about each location. This introduces some great uncertainty both in- and out-of-character. (The way the knowledge is framed, in-character, makes it clear to the characters as well as the players that it may be unreliable.) Really great way to thread the needle, in my opinion, between making an external, prepped world that feels real, and making sure the players have a sense of ownership of the campaign world.<br/><br/>P.S. Sandra, a player inventing a dragon cult that's chasing them is not violating the Czege Principle! They're not saying what the *outcome* of the conflict is.                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>In BtW, the players collaboratively add stuff to the map in Session Zero. But, the GM rolls secretly to see how accurate is their information about each location. This introduces some great uncertainty both in- and out-of-character. (The way the knowledge is framed, in-character, makes it clear to the characters as well as the players that it may be unreliable.) Really great way to thread the needle, in my opinion, between making an external, prepped world that feels real, and making sure the players have a sense of ownership of the campaign world.<br/>.</blockquote>
Oh, this is great. I’d written up a game system like this years back when Red Box Hack was Story Games’ favourite RPG to discuss for a while. I never got to play but I always thought it would be fun. Glad to see people are doing this!

<h2>"Theme Park"</h2>
I hate hate hate hate hate this metaphor for blorb formerly known as sandbox play. When you ride a roller coaster, what happens to it? Not a fucking thing.<br/><br/>When you build a sand castle, <i>there's a sandcastle there now</i>. When you knock one down, <i>there is no more sandcastle</i>.<br/><br/>World of Warcraft is a theme park. A theme park is Not Blorb. A theme park is a thin veneer of blorbliness for clueless rubes.
<h2>Are Relationship Maps Blorb?</h2>
Equivalent to asking, Are Dungeons Blorb?<br/><br/>A one-scenario relationship map with like, 3-8 folks on it? Not Blorb. A 5-room dungeon? Not Blorb.<br/><br/>A relationship map for the entire vampiric court of Chicago, with all the major power players, their main lieutenants, and the humans they most depend on for power and sustenance and maintaining the masquerade? Blorb. A 10-level megadungeon with multiple sub-levels and many routes? Blorb.                        </div>

A r-map of persons can easily be grown faster than players explore it. To me the fish tank is sandboxy most of all thanks to its evolution. T0/T1/Tx are diverging ("Think offscreen" in PbtA speak).

                            I don’t see why a story game couldn’t be a sandbox, though. Here’s a simple example I think about sometimes:<br/><br/>It’s a game about finding love and commitment, and the challenges of choosing the right partner.<br/><br/>You create a character, and then proceed to “date” a lot of people.<br/><br/>We generate a pool of love interests from<br/>a variety of random and non-random tools, and then the game is on. There are many individuals, all with different quirks and issues and appealing virtues. You must, in the end, choose whether to be with one of them or to be alone.<br/><br/>How’s that? Is it a sandbox?<br/><br/>What if we also add a variety of locations, which play into the dating scenarios? Would that make it more sandboxy, or is it unnecessary?                        </div>

                            But calling it insider trading implies there is an inherently antagonist relationship between players (in this case a DM and a regular player). Because insider trading is *cheating*. <br/><br/>I mean one could argue modifying the idea after learning more could be a good thing depending on the desired playstyle. <br/><br/>But I would guess here that it's about makeing as much as possible the world seem not just made up in response to the players for a blorb game.

That's pretty close to the core of the difference between blorb and not blorb. Just so everyone knows. I'm not forcing everyone to play blorb games. I personally think they're awesome, and that that particular difference was an earth-shattering revelation.
<blockquote class="Quote">I mean one could argue modifying the idea after learning more could be a good thing depending on the desired playstyle.</blockquote>

                            Well, yes and no, right? In theory, coming up with details just now is fine; it depends on how important the details are and whether they impact what we're interested in playing out. <br/><br/>That's where an awareness of the creative aims of the game is paramount, in my opinion. For instance, if part of what we're playing to find out is "are you smart enough to figure out the answer to the riddle?", I can't be inventing the answer on the spot, after I've heard your guess. But there are other things which don't need to be or don't benefit from being prepped; understanding the creative goals of the game is what allows us to differentiate between those consistently and in a principled way.<br/><br/>(I hope I'm not just rehashing an old conversation, though; in that case, feel free to ignore!)                        </div>

I hate hate hate hate hate this metaphor for blorb formerly known as sandbox play. When you ride a roller coaster, what happens to it?

I think you're taking the metaphor too far. It's like saying, but what if you remove all water from the fish tank, without actually realizing what the metaphor is <a href="https://gnomestew.com/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow">trying to show</a>.<br/><br/>"Imagine a fish tank with some piranhas in it. The tank and the water are the environment of the latent mystery waiting to be disturbed. The fish represent the people and their relationships with each other. Now imagine the GM throws the PCs into the tank, sits back and then enjoys the show. "<br/><br/>The theme park metaphor is basically just another way of saying "Make up places which the players can ignore or visit and to do something".                        </div>

This answer doesn't tell me anything because you haven't stated what your definition of "blorb" is, and I thought we talked about sandboxes (in particular <b>Kenny</b>'s definition of it) and not <i>your</i> definition of something else.<br/><br/>I can understand the thought of trying to be a "fair" referee, but I don't think it's GM vs players in tabletop roleplaying but a collaboration between all participants to make it as engaging as possible. If you got that mindset, then it's merely semiotics between making up stuff on the spot and preparing, and the thought of be able to combine a sandbox with a non-trad gaming style is then certainly possible.<br/><br/><a href="https://blackfiskforlag.com/spel/fornsaga/" rel="nofollow">Fornsaga</a> comes to mind, where you play vikings that explore questions about the characters and settlement where they live, while being able to have (cool) hexcrawl elements.                        </div>

Because it feels like you are cute fishies in the water or whatever.

Why this topic was brought up, in the beginning, was that <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> said that prep wasn't prep if it was done during the session: "In Svart av kval, vit av lust the map is created as part of play; I don't count it as prepped." (also, it wasn't considered prep if it was done in a collaborative manner? Not sure if that was was she meant.)<br/><br/>We're talking about this from that perspective; not that <i>prep = improv</i>.<br/> </div>

I think the chess analogy is exactly right, though you were trying to make it into a caricature.<br/><br/>If I get together with my friend to play chess, but our goal is learn new moves and talk about strategy together, there’s no reason not look at Stockfish. Heck, we might do it together, to talk about what moves the program recommends and try to figure out why they’re better than our moves.<br/><br/>(I used to have a friend I played chess with like that; it was great!)<br/><br/>In some game modes, there’s absolutely no need for the GM to be impartial, and, in fact, the opposite is desirable.

                            Oh, I had read that and lost the meaning <i>en route</i>, <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> .<br/>Sure, collaboration impacts what the players will "deduce, discover, explore". There are ways, though, to make surprise and discovery possible. Imagine a map is prepped together. Then a table of encounters with modifiers for each part of the map is agreed upon. That's blorby allright and there will be surprise, too. I suspect this is the kind of game that steps on blorbs toes.<br/>Distinguishing "before play" and "before scenes" seems unreasonably casuistic. <br/> </div>

                            What we've done is to go into the random dungeon generator tables in the AD&amp;D1e DMG (this was summer of 2014 before the 5e DMG came out) without a DM, explore a randomly generated dungeon, trying to find treasure &amp; get out alive (because we pretty quickly fell down a bunch of levels, so finding stairs up became a priority). It was cool but we only did it a couple of times.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know if this style is good or bad. You see me making these extreme statement that such-and-such playstyle is bullshit or whatever but… I don't do those willy-nilly. When I don't know, I don't know.                        </div>

                            I wasn't expecting a value judgement, rather a qualification. That kind of game is not blorby TM but I don't see a difference in case of a mysterious mirror scenario. <br/>What would be a significant difference would be the players being able to change the mirror with a Lore roll. But the map and encounters, whatever way they are found, I don't see what it changes regarding their "firm reality".<br/><br/>In other words, I still don't see what's about Vit av lust.

I want to talk about this bit here, this thing about the doors and choice.

It’s not a great situation and it’s a very contrived &amp; exaggerated example. Normally the more information &amp; agency the player has about the various choices the better. If I run a module and I find myself describing a choice between two exact same doors, I think to myself “this module sucks”. Right now I’m running the Tomb of Annihilation which is, I think, good; the various areas and corridors all have a very clear &amp; different theme making the choices between them be, while sometimes deceptive &amp; devious, at least not non-choices. Whenever there’s a “non-choice”; like where we are right now in the game there is one area where the players can choose between a 5 foot wide corridor and a 10 foot wide corridor not otherwise distinguished; I know from reading ahead that those corridors will quickly enough distinguish themselves from each other well in time before turning into you having made an inescapable choice.</p><p><small>Also, in Smullyan’s original example (I ran this in our first al-Qadim campaign) there are signs on the door.</small></p><p><small>Above both doors it says “One of the signs is true, but the other one is false.”</small></p><p><small>One door says “This door leads to your freedom and the other door leads to a tiger.”<br/>The other door says: “One of these doors leads to your freedom and one of these doors leads to a tiger.”</small></p><p>The lady and the tiger example is very extreme to make it absolutely clear that we’re talking about:</p><blockquote class="Quote"><p>the idea that a GM shouldn’t be switching things up arbitrarily</p></blockquote><p>This. When the very basics of blorb are being questioned we need basic &amp; extreme examples so that everyone is on the same page about what blorb is (don’t switch the content behind doors).</p><p>It’s not a dancer’s job to be the theatre floor. Their job is to dance on that floor, to fly over it. Similarly, in blorby play, the player should not be asked to be in the mindset of collaboration. Their job is to explore, experience, make choices in, set their mark on, discover the game world. It’s the DM’s job to be keeper of that game world; keep it honestly, solidly, vividly.</p><p>A drink of cold water in a beautiful tall glass on a hot day isn’t improved by glass fragments being mixed into the water. The glass is doing its job by holding the water. The water is doing its job by not spilling out on the table. The two components are working together but don’t mix. The glass feels cool to the touch and looks beautiful. The water is nice to drink and looks beautiful in a different way.</p><p>Similarly, the alchemy of blorb is the player character dancing on the gloracle, consulting the gloracle. A human referee &amp; DM is a great technique to use for purposes of adjudication and information separation, so that the gloracle, the physics layer, the world layer, can be this beautiful canvas, this wide snowfield where the hobo’s footprints will soon enough be left.</p><p>A good player in a blorby game takes their role as visitor to another world seriously. In this holodeck, or danger room, or Narnia wardrobe, they have one job. It’s a difficult one: To live.</p><p>A good DM in a blorby game respects that role separation.</p> </div>

                            Those are no valid arguments. The image of a liquid (impro) and a solid (commitment) came to my mind before. I thought : I don't see what she feels wrong with the magma flowing around these bits and nuggets of solid prep. Why should the crust be one big flat floor ? That's a preference or a dogma. What is necessary in it ?<br/>What if the chocolate nuggets are here just to be firm enough for a few crunch and then, when the table feels like it, explore the mellowness of this or that particular chunk melting (cheating the blob locally for a great effect) ? Or what if, step by step, all the magma would coalesce in polarized patterns around the unmovable chunks (that the guilty is punished or the witch burned).

                            Analogies are illustrations to make a position clearer to understand.<br/><br/>It's my position that some forms of collaboration in a blorby game is as unhelpful as glass fragments in drinking water. Making this realization was difficult enough (it took me twenty years! Twenty years of crappy roleplaying!); finding good rhetorical arguments for it is an even taller order. Especially when it's about something as mystical &amp; experiental as playing a blorby game. Which to me is life-changing magic.<br/><br/>From <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484304/#Comment_484304" rel="nofollow">the other thread</a>:

                            More and more as I'm reading this thread the allure of that type of play is wearing off for me. <br/><br/>I in fact believe the opposite, that this style of play would quickly loose it's allure for me. It's something I tried in the past but honestly a world that's connected more by everyones input and something everyone can be passionate about is paramount for me and honestly a world where we just made something up on the spot doesn't feel any less real or immersive for me.<br/><br/>It's all made up, I'd rather make it up together.                        </div>

                            My experience is somewhat similar; I participated in and ran games in a highly blorby” style for years on end, and it never really <i>got there</i>, though it was OK.<br/><br/>I find the technique incredibly useful for some things (and it finally allowed me to properly enjoy D&amp;D for the first time), but it’s ultimately much less important to me than other things that actually make the gaming take on emotionally intensity and joy.<br/><br/>I should probably get back to the “traveller/ice moon” thread and write about that there.                        </div>

                            I think a general answer is to play in the same game world long enough. You do can it with different games or by using the same game. As more of the world gets created through play, more and more will be established. This will give a feeling of playing in a more solid place. (Neutral/objective/hygienic/etc. game mastering does not follow.)<br/><br/>For me, as a player, one benefit of a sandbox is that world feels more solid and it pushes back, sometimes, so that I, as a player, can not simply mold it along my wishes. For me Burning wheel also gives this feeling, when the game master is not too soft about asking dice rolls. The roll difficulties are often quite well defined by the fictional circumstances, which adds to the feeling of a solid world.<br/><br/>But yeah, I think think player commitment to respecting a pre-established world is the key. I would recommend establishing the world through play, rather than by reading about an existing one, but maybe that could work, too. There will be problems if the game gives narrative authority to people who know significantly less about the setting than some others do.                        </div>

                            Sandra, you might be interested in Morten Greis Petersen's blog: <a href="https://rollespil.blog/category/rollespil/nordisk-rollespil/forbidden-lands/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://rollespil.blog/category/rollespil/nordisk-rollespil/forbidden-lands/</a> . He has extensive play reports on various games; currently running (or maybe playing) D&amp;D 5, Forbidden lands and some flavour of Warhammer, but the archives are deep.<br/><br/>His currently preferred play style is not hardcore challenge play. He describes the mechanics well enough for one to get at least some ideas of the features.                        </div>

                            (If by "traditional" you mean "90s style middle school storyteller roleplaying", you're 100% correct. But if, as I suspect Sandra does, you mean "traditional GM/player split of creative authorities, actor stance, mechanics simulating task resolution", etc, then OSR-style gaming pretty much <i>defines</i> "traditional", since it's the root of the hobby.)                        </div>

                            Thanuir, I translated Petersen's first entry using Google Translate, and felt like I was able to understand it pretty well, despite some of the oddities, like kidneys that activated their special abilities. :-D I even ran the same dungeon he did!<br/><br/>He and I had pretty much the same impression. FL merges the mythic and the low fantasy very well, and the system is very engaging: deadly, and requiring thought, but not so brutal you can't get anything done.<br/><br/>He did something that, in hindsight, I wish I'd done, which is give everyone 1 Willpower Point to start.                        </div>

                            Yeah seems like I had a pretty good guess about Forbidden Lands. I have a couple of the books for it.

                            That blog was in Danish using the English edition of Forbidden Lands. I have the Swedish version of some of the books, they are called Svärdets Sång. I wanted to run those modules in D&amp;D but I've realized that I need to check the core books to be able to convert stuff, and so the project moved to the "enh someday maybe" pile.                        </div>
