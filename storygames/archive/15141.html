So I am wondering what the game would look like if we just used keys instead of highlighted stats? <br/><br/>Obviously the amount of XP would not translate directly. But, the concept of a fighter with the key of bloodlust does represent an interesting decent into madness for the character as they advance. Sure you start off small killing a few things, but before you know if you're warmongering to get enough things to slay.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344147/#Comment_344147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T14:47:08+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  2:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a pretty sweet hack, and since TSoY is free as HTML, wouldn't that allow Sage and Adam to freely steal the concept as long as Clinton is credited?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is relevant to my interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344156/#Comment_344156" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T16:16:38+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  4:16PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keys are super-great technology and, fashioned appropriately, could be great for DW.

In D&amp;D XP progression goes up at the same rate as XP earned, so you maintain the 12 encounter / 3 session progression. <br/><br/>In dungeon world, my players are getting about 20 XP per session, so while the progression is great at the beginning I can really see it coming to a crawl very quickly. If it is really that important to level early wouldn't it be better to just create a stronger starting character and then follow with a standard progression?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344211/#Comment_344211" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T04:55:53+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  4:55AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>I note that under a direct-ish port of Sweet 20 you'd at least get more Keys at every odd level.

It's exactly as you suspect: the practical medium TSoY functions in only allows a character to be involved in one event at a time, so as long as you can get a Key to activate each time you do something, you're not deriving any benefit from the rest of your Keys. This of course assumes that Keys do not stack - you cannot just get lots of nigh-identical Keys that tend to apply to the same situations and activate them all at once. For the dramatic purposes of TSoY not having stacking Keys makes perfect sense, especially because the Story Guide is supposed to coordinate towards the Keys in framing scenes; maybe some other game that used Keys within a different framework could have Keys stack and thus derive more use out of them, although I guess it would make for boring character builds to encourage players to stack as many variations of the Key of Bloodlust as possible.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>Uh?

One is the key of alignment, another the key of bonds, and third the key of circumstance (situational moves that earn xp). Additionally, there are two active stat keys. What we're interested in doing is replace the stat keys, which are tied to game mechanics and not character behavior with a different mechanism.<br/><br/>My suggestion is to replace the stat keys with keys from the five factor traits.

In a long-running campaign, these characters are then replaced with more interesting "fresh" characters. <br/><br/>In D&amp;D, however, "beginning" characters cannot play very well with "advanced" characters. I think that may be one of the reasons for the exponential XP gain model: you can bring a "new" character into a D&amp;D game and as you gain XP with the group, you will soon reach their level, or something close to it. (A low-level character will level up much faster in a high-level group, and, in the same way, a high-level character will be quite stagnant in a low-level group until they catch up.)<br/><br/>There may be a good reason not to have "flat" advancement in a game where you might be mixing "advanced" and "beginning" characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344251/#Comment_344251" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T12:02:55+00:00" title="September 28, 2011 12:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was planning on using 10+level instead of 10xlevel for DW advancement.

Or both.  Trope Keys for highlighting, Class Keys (allowing the groovy Prestige Playbook Key idea), Alignment Keys (which should include breaking it).<br/><br/>I'd like to give this a go next week, so how about working out some Keys?  Never written any, so these may not be right at all.

I don't think I've quite got the feel for writing these (Motivation?  Dramatic?), though I think they'd encourage the level of sociopathy traditionally associated with dungeon adventurers.  Also, the Key of Teamwork could potentially generate a lot more XP than the others, which for the most part are only available once per encounter, to a single character.

I'd also envisage an individual key, perhaps Class based (from a list with or without overlaps), and/or one that captures the reason for adventure (including things like 'protect this person' or 'find materials for my experiments') which might fill the fictional space of the current Bond-as-backstory-statement, but is actionable and non-antagonistic.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike_Olson</cite>I'd like to see each player choose two from the same list (i.e., no class-specific Keys)</blockquote>\nI envisage two Dungeon Keys being highlighted like Stats are at present- one by another player (who has the highest Bond-as-aid-rating with you) and one by the GM.  As in this is what I'm interested in seeing you do this session.  Mike, you think the player should choose their own- why?<br/><br/>Having slept on things, and thinking back to my last (short) game, other than Teamwork the way the fiction worked out these keys as written would have yielded (zero?), one or two XP each.  As I expect them to replace the contribution of highlighted stats (as in encouraging and rewarding specific behaviours), that's insufficient for my intentions.  So less of the 'first' or 'last' references and more possibility of recurrence in a given scene and/or across the party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344409/#Comment_344409" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T11:23:27+00:00" title="September 29, 2011 11:23AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>I envisage two Dungeon Keys being highlighted like Stats are at present- one by another player (who has the highest Bond-as-aid-rating with you) and one by the GM.</blockquote>\nI concur.

The idea behind the Dungeon Keys is that they're 'iconic'.  I'm not totally happy that I've in effect highlighted +Bond with Teamwork, and the Key of Looting will inherently give less XP than highlighting WIS.  So the balance is off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344431/#Comment_344431" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T13:32:53+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  1:32PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>Perhaps a Key of Greed, where you mark XP when you Claim a treasure, any treasure.</blockquote>\nHeh!
