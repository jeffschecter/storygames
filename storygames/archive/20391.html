This is something I'd love to have in a physical format but I think the hardcopy was preeetty limited...<br/>Willing to discuss cost and pay shipping.<br/><br/>(And, in case of concern about profits to the author, I'm also purchasing in PDF, just would love physical booklets <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/>- Alex                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
