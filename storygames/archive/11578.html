My overall opinion is that these forums find a good balance by providing people the freedom to reveal or conceal their identity. Here's a few issues that don't seem to have come up yet:<br/><br/>Be careful of believing the "real names" you see, because they might not be, even on the rollover. We're gamers. We know how to open up a phonebook to find a decent false name, and there's no identity verification process used by this site. You can claim your real name is Brennen Reece, but I have no way to verify that short of spending some good money or effort, enough that a username wouldn't hide your identity anyways.<br/><br/>User names can be useful for differentiating people with the same name. For example, there are at least two Grahams that use this forum. If we're both talking in a thread, you'd have to use our full names, but a username differentiates us in fewer keystrokes.<br/><br/>Real names are better for connecting people with their work, unless, of course, people also write under an assumed name or business name. Just ask any guy who writes pulp romance novels.<br/><br/>There can be privacy issues, both legally (e.g. under Canada's laws, organizations are liable for any unauthorized use or release of any private information collected) and personally (e.g. worries about prejudice for reasons of gender).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258002/#Comment_258002" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T04:19:11+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  4:19AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I don't know why I like to use online nicks. Not too long before I redeployed from Iraq, I asked Vincent over on the Forge to change my long-standing user name to my real name, because it felt like the thing to do and the time to do it. My signature has included my real name for years, so it wasn't a matter of privacy. (Also, there was no pressure for me use or switch to my real name, at all). But here, I still use, and may continue to use, Wolfe. It's a part of my identity, and I've used it in lots of places. There was a time in my life when I'd have answered to 'Gorim' without a second thought. Despite the fact that I don't present myself any differently online than I do in real life (at least, not on purpose), I think it helps keep some separation in the different areas of my life. Though you may call me Lance here, it's quite possible that you think of me as Wolfe still.. Those who think of me as Lance have *probably* made a stronger connection to me than others who just see the nick. It does grow less convenient to use an online user name when the prospect of meeting people in real life comes up. At GenCon, I frequently had to introduce myself as "Lance, Wolfe or Wolfen from S-G and the Forge" before people I interacted with only casually made the connection... and that's with only one Lance who's been a frequent user in either community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258007/#Comment_258007" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T05:11:13+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  5:11AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually use my real name.

Any and all of those are appropriate in different situations and for different reasons. I wouldn't trust an obviously invented person, for example, but do we need trust on a web forum?<br/><br/>I myself practice complete transparency due to ideological reasons, believing that truth is better than lies. I do recognize that this is a sort of luxury that I couldn't afford if I opted to work for the Man, say - Epediah lists pretty good scenarios for what might happen as a consequence of transparent web activity nowadays. I have to admit that I admire people who share my habit of transparent Internet activity, simply because their choice affirms and strengthens the social trend of making Internet part of the world, and allowing all people the luxury of having opinions and being media activists therein without fear of reprisal. The opposite choice of hiding your identity in fear of consequences affirms the idea that public speaking is only suitable for professionals who control and profit from their public presence in a careful manner, and the average Joe shouldn't dare to do it, or he might lose his job or go to jail; should the majority adopt this received wisdom, that'll make the road towards strong digital democracy that much longer. There is strength in numbers, so I can't help but think that everybody who chooses to conduct their Internet business with a strong, real identity is doing their part to make Internet be a bit more about people and communication instead of faceless masses and premeditated corporate media.<br/><br/>Aside from the slight ideological admiration, the real name mostly doesn't matter to me in a forum context. I don't much care if a person presents himself with an obviously fantastical name, for example; a non-arbitrary alternative identity is good enough for most purposes. Complete anonymity starts to matter due to how people react to the power provided by anonymity - that power is rarely used responsibly, which makes me inclined to discount anonymous contributions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258065/#Comment_258065" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T08:52:15+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  8:52AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add to the list of good reasons:<br/><br/>I'm trying to make a career for myself as an academic and/or think-tank researcher, which means I ideally want to eventually make the top hits for my name on Google to be for my academic work and not for my hobbies (which are great, but will never be my day job).

If someone has a handle but their real name is mouse-overable (see Valamir/Ralph M), I'll often default to their real name in replies if I know them in real life, or their handle if I never met them before. Other than that, I don't really think too much of it either way. It can produce interesting social dynamics.<br/><br/>The only thing I have an opinion on is the fine line between people who adopt a pseudonym for classic anonymity reasons (see Quintin Stone, who's in my gaming group, who has been known online as QS since the 90s), and people who do it for fear of stalking/confrontation from the folks/victims they talk to or about because they hide behind their anonymity in order to treat others like shit. Luckily, I don't think we've ever seen the latter around here.<br/><br/>While I'm not too worried about being stalked or anonymity (because I don't treat people like shit), I usually just go with "Andy K" on most forums and the like. Just seems more personable than my incredibly long and confusing Polish surname.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>ps: There aren't that many Kitkowski's. In fact, I was able to register kitkowski dot com, kitkowski on facebook and kitkowski at gmail. So I have no where to hide.

I want people here in the community to know who I am, and I'm open about signing email and other communication with my name. But at the same time, I have to consider the fact that I'm trying to build up my portfolio and establish a career as a fine artist. When you sell fine art, you're selling YOURSELF as much as you're selling your artwork. And much as many of us try to deny the fact, gaming as a hobby is still pretty controversial - at least if you're not lucky enough to live in the Scandinavian Lands of Hippy Awesomeness. I'm very careful about what I allow to be linked to my real name on the internet because when the day comes that I have established my portfolio and am going after gallery representation I will need to be very careful about safeguarding my reputation online. More and more, galleries are venturing into online spaces and de-emphasizing physical galleries, so this is important!<br/><br/>Sure, it would be awesome to live in a world of idealism and say "fuck the man! I own my thoughts and I'm not ashames of them!". But I'm not willing to compromise my dreams for the sake of idealism. If you want to make a living selling fine art, you have to be practical.

I can't help it, but I do react more positively to real-seeming names that have a cultural angle than made-up stuff like "Wordman" or "Vulpinoid". Insofar as this angle goes it doesn't seem to matter at all if it's the person's real name. This might have something to do with the perceived purpose of the name (for instance, I don't mind that some indie designers want to use pen names), but I think that mostly it's just that geeky hacker names seem immature, and thus aesthetically displeasing. Then again, a real-seeming made up name seems pretty silly as well in that it doesn't message its falseness, so in a way it's even more duplicitous than a hacker name.<br/><br/>Also, speaking of false identities - you could use a nom de plume if you were worried about the image associated with your real name, Anna. That might be much less stressful than managing your public persona to accord with a subculture you do not find naturally agreeable. Then you could use your real name when you don't mind being honest and your professional identity when you want to manipulate Google searches. An obvious advantage here is that instead of a double lie (lying both about your name among hobbyists and about your interests in work context) you would only need to remember one lie.<br/><br/>Anna's case about the controversiality of gaming is a good point, it seems to me - are there other folks here who find it necessary to hide their identity specifically because gaming itself is an unhonorable pastime in their locality? That's something that wouldn't have occurred to me at all - my gaming exploits are an important part of my own CV, and I haven't myself encountered much trouble in spinning the hobby as a fine and cultured endeavour worthy of respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258172/#Comment_258172" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T13:09:38+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  1:09PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use a pseudonym that is a (somewhat outdated) nickname in real life. My main concern with using my real name isn't necessarily HR companies / my employer / etc finding my posts and giving me grief (although that shit really does happen), it's that, as a teacher, I don't want my students seeing my posts just because they thought they'd try and find out stuff about me. Yeah, I know, I guess any of you could actually be my students, or anyone here's boss, but I'm cool with that, if they've found story games and then clocked me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I'm as belligerent as the next man if anything came out about anything I posted at work (if my job was at risk or something), I'd rather reduce the possibility of that as much as possible, to save me the hassle. The mouse-over thing is as far as I'll go, and a pretty good compromise if you ask me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258179/#Comment_258179" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T13:20:39+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  1:20PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use a handle with my real name attached in order to minimize the public exposure of my real name for professional purposes. If someone wants to, they can make that connection, but when someone does and Internet search for my real name, I want them to find my professional web presence (law-related). If someone wants to find my more nerd-related web presence (gaming, my podcast, my Twitter feed, etc.) then they can search for my handle. It's one of the reasons I refuse to participate in Google Buzz as it stands: there's no way to have a public profile that doesn't display your real name in association with a handle. It makes that connection public and easy.<br><br>Largely I do this for the same reason that Guy "Millsy" Milner above does: I don't want my clients, colleagues, or judges to be able to easily track down anything about my personal life. At the same time, I'm not ashamed of my viewpoints or hobbies, so it's clearly not impossible to connect my name and my handle. If I ever become a professional writer or game designer or something like that, I won't care as much, but right now I like to keep that barrier for the purposes of professional reputation and the repute of the administration of justice.<br/><br/>I think the mouseover is one of the best things we've got going, because it does walk that private/public balance quite nicely.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258257/#Comment_258257" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T16:04:04+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  4:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vote in this thread to change my username to Anonymous A.

Maybe it does change the way people relate to each other - but I don't know. I suspect, for instance, that the unusual tone of the forge has little to do with the fact that people use real names (or claim to), and more to do with the attitude of the moderators and therefore community about the way people should talk to each other. I strongly suspect that giving a name is a part of that which could easily be removed with no change in the character of the place - and the same goes for here.<br/><br/>As Eero touched on above, identity is more than just a given name. I will never meet most of you, and what i know of you comes from the posts, the things you write that reveal yourself. Your name, whatever name you use, is nothing more than a handle to hang on that, a placeholder that allows me to remember and connect your different posts.<br/>Sometimes the given name itself, if invented, reveals a bit about you too, which can be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258297/#Comment_258297" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T18:35:24+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  6:35PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I'm reminded of is that I've only had one type of situation in which I've really cared about the Internet institution of false names. That is when I'm doing a convention or other activity with people I know from the Internet, and <i>you know how fucking hard it is to find the right person</i> when you know their real name but the database lists them by handles, or you know the handle but your data concerns their real names? I've mostly encountered this in the Finnish Boardgame Association, which has both active forums and active real-world event schedule. Active organizators of that sort of stuff have to know this stuff, and then I end up trying to find some "Jerkboy534" on my phone when he's actually under "Pentti Lehtola" - but how would I remember, when it's been a full year since I put him there? A damn useless and conceited bother, all that.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, the Finnish-Swedish minority has a time-honored tradition of using handles in the real world - they all have these cutesy nicknames you-just-have-to-know to keep track of who's who. They've done that since 18th century manorialism when they needed to distinguish between the colonial masters and the peasantry, I understand. Annoyment, but it'd be pretty petty to throw them out of the association for something like that.<br/><br/>I would probably have similar trouble at Gencon if I weren't busy enough trying to figure where I should be going next myself. Just so you know, I probably didn't know who you were when we met there, whoever you are - impossible enough to keep track of 150 indie rpg activists without trying to remember two names for each, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258308/#Comment_258308" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T18:59:28+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  6:59PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have two things to say in this thread.<br/><br/>1: I mostly go by Elizabeth nowadays despite being "dissolvegirl" for the vast majority of my time on the internet, because I found it ear-gratingly awful when I'd meet people in person and they'd call me dissolvegirl.

I just find it awkward to address someone with something that doesn't sound like a name.  I wind up shortening them sometimes -- I keep starting posts to komradebob with "K-Bob," etc.<br/><br/>I often post during work hours, but I don't post anywhere about work stuff.  I doubt my bosses would ever read my screed on simulationism and calculate how long it must have taken me to write it.  If one did, I could just lie and say I copied and pasted it from an email I composed at home.<br/><br/>BTW, thanks for revealing the rollover names.

I often shorten it to K-Bob when referring to myself online too.<br/><br/>Komradebob, or Comrade Bob, was a nickname I picked up at an old job, where a bunch of us were feeling very put upon by our boss, so we started referring to one another as Comrade {First name or nickname}.

Mine, for example, is the product of late 80's rap lingo mixed with my high shcool's hippie roots and my last name, mixing "Word, man" and "Ward" together in the way high school students play with language that had half my tennis team calling me "Ward, man", which quickly turned into "Wordman". But, whatever, there is no way for you to know the "lineage" of a name when you see it. If it comes across as a hacker handle, so be it.<br/><br/>As far as aesthetics, as you say, people get quite different pictures in their heads when they read "Wordman" vs. when they read "Lester".

But even then, there's still a level of connection I find that is missing just from not having met the person. I have had the experience twice now of meeting someone in person who signed everything with their given name, both of whom I previously COULD NOT STAND on the internet and discovering that I actually really enjoyed them as people. What's more, once we went our separate ways and we returned to conversing online I found that the things that used to PISS ME OFF didn't bother me anymore because meeting them ennabled me to realize that the way they communicated in person was just getting lost in translation by the time that I read it as words on a screen.<br/><br/>Did that make sense? Let me emphasize. These were people whose names I knew and who I thought I was reading correctly, only to discover after meeting them that I totally wasn't and that I actually didn't have a problem with them after all. I think never having met the person you're conversing with is a much bigger factor than not knowing their name.<br/><br/>(Also, I think geography played a factor. In both cases, these were people speaking different regional dialects of English from my own, and I think a lot more of that translates to written communication than we realize. It's hard to remember on the internet that people don't speak the same variant of English that you do.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258567/#Comment_258567" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T16:35:19+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  4:35PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's interesting how people talk about paranoid work environments leading them to use aliases. I work for probably the most paranoid institution in the country. We've been informed that our communications on social networking sites and blogs WILL be sought out and monitored. I *have* been approached regarding a work-related rant I'd written on LiveJournal... that was hidden, only visible to <i>me.</i> Now, the military has legitimate reasons for their paranoia, but it still means you've got to watch your Ps and Qs.<br/>\n<br/>\n...but for all of that, aside from making sure I don't mention anything that might violate operational security, I don't care that much about privacy or anonymity. I'm very up-front with who I am, what I do, and how I feel about things, including things that are buzzwords for the military. I'm much less so in person, though. I think it's because, ever since I got online back in 1998 or so, the internet has been a place where I feel safe saying things I'd feel horribly shy about expressing in person, and where I feel free to be exactly who I am.

So, if we run our community by ignoring the fact that we are faceless strangers thousands of miles apart and, instead, conduct ourselves as if we were a small face-to-face community where everyone knows each other on a first name basis (sort of like <i>Cheers</i>), then people will automatically conduct themselves closer to how they would face to face, and better communication will result.<br><br>The other school of thought has three <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">objections</span> concerns with this:<br><br>1) This approach ignores the reality that we <i>actually are</i> faceless strangers thousands of miles apart and that this fact really does matter. In some ways (some of which are mentioned in previous posts), <i>pretending</i> that this is not true actually makes communication worse (particularly if some don't buy into the delusion).<br/><br/>2) The "hey, we all know each other by our first names, we're like family" approach from strangers is also used by another group of people on the internet: spammers, scammers and other criminals. Years of conditioning against such cretins builds a strong reaction against the "Hi faceless internet stranger! I'm Bob! What's your name? This isn't <i>really</i> the faceless internet around here. Come be my friend!" approach.<br/><br/>3) On a subliminal level there is an underlying accusation of "we're certain that if you don't give your real name that you will not be able to conduct yourself civilly here." No one actually says (or even means) this, of course, and this is not a huge deal, but just as aliases give some a reduced first impression, a policy like this can hit the wrong chord in someone as well. Mixed with this is also a feeling of "we think it is perfectly appropriate to demand that you sacrifice your privacy to play with us" that just rubs some people (like me) the wrong way.<br/><br/>I suspect that one reason real names seem to be a bit more favored at Story Games is that, when this forum started, many of the "alpha posters" (or whatever the term is) had already met face-to-face at least once. (I agree with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">wundergeek</span> Anna Kreider that once you meet someone, you are more likely to "hear" their posts in their own voice and inflection, and that this matters a lot more than you might think.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258667/#Comment_258667" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T07:12:24+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  7:12AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, <i>The Daily Show</i> shamed me about fake internet handles.

I'd have to modify your categorization on my own part slightly by clarifying that I do not want to pretend that we're all RL friends - I want to pretend that we're all accountable, serious and human. The "serious" bit there means "serious about committing to a real instance of communication", by the way; it might be the most important thing I want to communicate by using my real name, the fact that I am actually here and actually care of whatever discussion I'm having at the moment. That there is no danger of me faking this interaction by not being me and not listening with respect. Specifically, by using an established identity and one identical to my RL person, I hope to communicate that my participation in the Internet is not frivolous, shallow and motivated by LULZ. Not a troll, not a sockpuppet, not a haughty mask looking for one-sided entertainment by scoring imaginary social points, but simply me.<br/><br/>(It's interesting to note, perhaps, that my attitudes on this matter are heavily influenced by the Forge. I didn't have any particular digital identity before the Forge, and after that the attitudes and values of the Forge have sort of stuck with me insofar as Internet communication goes.)<br/><br/>I have no idea if this is a wise or ultimate course in the development of digital communication. This is such a young platform that nobody knows where we're actually going. For all I know, five years from now I might conduct all of my communication with strong cryptography under a new hacker alias because I decided at some point that cryptoanarchy is the new black.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258674/#Comment_258674" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T07:44:55+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  7:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Specifically, by using an established identity and one identical to my RL person, I hope to communicate that my participation in the Internet is not frivolous, shallow and motivated by LULZ..</blockquote>\nYeah, but what if someone's nickname, which you assume to be their anonymous chat handle, is actually the identity which is established and identical to the one used in real life? Like in Wordman's case, and in the case of dozens of military dudes I know who go by some unrecognizable bastardization of their surnames. I know a guy who'd take any conversation he had under the name of Lundy way more seriously than anything addressed to him as David, <i>possibly</i> with the exception of the person he was speaking to being his mom. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I know a dude whose full and legal name is Azrael Marshall Darkchyld. Would addressing him that way make you feel less silly?<br/><br/>There are cultures where nicknames are the appropriate address for performance reviews, award ceremonies, you name it. I think for the most part, I agree with you that it's best to use the name you're most personally invested in when having conversations with other people on the internet. I just tend to give people the benefit of the doubt when they tell me which name is what they're most personally invested in-- whether it's an obvious nickname, a person transitioning between genders, or some dude who changed his legal name to the name of his favorite roleplaying character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258676/#Comment_258676" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T07:50:07+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  7:50AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought Paul T was Paul Tevis too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258680/#Comment_258680" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T08:06:20+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  8:06AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, note that above I was just telling about my own reasons for using my own name, not describing what I expect of others. I do realize that others have their reasons for not using a "real" name. As I mentioned in passing upthread, I don't really mind the various nicknames for something as inconsequential as forum discussions. Actual strong anonymity without persistent identities at all would be a killer, but for the most part people take their invented names seriously enough to conduct themselves. Whether a name sounds real doesn't matter to me that much, ultimately it's just an aesthetic thing. If I specifically knew that somebody's invented name carried great weight for some reason, then I wouldn't look down on it even the little bit I tend to with frivolous Internet identities.<br/><br/>I'd say that probably the strongest reaction you'd get from me in this name business is if you'd choose an obviously lame nickname for yourself. Then I'd think that you're either inexperienced or lame, for surely otherwise you could've picked something more inventive than "Optimus Prime" or "Jackie142".

The Fnord got added when I needed an online handle for my first forays into BBSes, and I'd recently read <i>The Illuminatus Trilogy</i>. Fnord seemed a perfectly ironic disambiguation (you'd be surprised how popular "Czar" and "Tsar" and variations thereof were).<br/><br/>And long before <i>The Daily Show</i> (maybe 1998-ish?) I started feeling the same way: silly. But it was an established posting identity by then, so I "came out" finally as "David 'Czar Fnord' Artman." (Also "Mad Czar," also "Mad Czar Fnord"--Mad Czar Creations was a short, ill-conceived freelance business.) It was not long after the shuttering of the freelance biz that the nick was dropped entirely.<br/><br/>For me, now, it's largely an issue of reputation (for good or ill)--I was only partially tongue in cheek with my post above about Google page rank (#1 BABY! Eat your heart out, Pastor David Artman of the First Christian Church in Harrison, Arkansas!). That and the sheer silliness of these convention exchanges:<br/>"Hi, what's your PC's name?<br/>"Largo; yours?"<br/>"Ah, cool. Mine's Lord Geryon--and your real name?"<br/>"David Artman, pleased to meet you."<br/>"I'm Bob Smart. I go by PookieBear on RPG.net."<br/>"Oh, you're PookieBear! Cool; I'm Czar Fnord."<br/>"Riight. Good to put a face to the name."<br/><br/>Now how in the FUCK is my stoner ass gonna remember THREE damned names at that game table? For maybe EVERY player? Madness. I offer a way out:<br/>"Hi, I'm Dave Artman, from Story Games...?

Complete anonymity has a similar relationship to partial anonymity (usernames) as partial anonymity has to no anonymity.  Basically, when you're not accountable to anything, you can get away with saying all sorts of things you would never say in real life, and the temptation is pretty much too hard for most people to ignore, whether or not they consciously realize it.<br/><br/>As for me, I use "veritascitor" on Story Games because it is the login name that I use pretty much everywhere.  I would gladly use "Mike Riverso" here, as it's a community I feel comfortable with, but this website doesn't have a distinction between login name and display name, and I like to keep my login names consistent.  *shrug*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259176/#Comment_259176" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T02:59:38+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  2:59AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite>While not quite the same, 4chan is essentially a case study in this sort of thing.

The posting culture varies a lot between the various sub-boards, there have been some awesome and extremely intelligent threads there (See the whole 4chan 40k, for example.) and all in all, reading 4chan isn't, IME; noticably worse then reading an of the other "somewhat rough places" of the net. (I am a bit reminded of old RPGnet in parts.)<br/><br/>Are there horrible, horrible exceptions? Of course. But all in all, the often toutet idea that Anonymity will automatically make asses of people doesn't hold true. I'd say there are people who will use the guise of anonymity to be an ass, but the same people would probably be assholes if they operated under a "normal sounding pseudonym" or their real name.<br/><br/>Or take a look sometime on a real anonymous network: The TOR network. Browsing through the various forums used as hidden services, you'll obviously find dickishness and worse. (In some parts much, much worse.) But for the most part, people there seem to manage not being more of a dick to each other then anywhere else on the net.<br/><br/>So I think while anonymity is probably a chance for some to let their dicks hang out, the effect depends much on the person, with individual forum culture and the reactions of others a much bigger influence then the nicknames.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259177/#Comment_259177" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T03:11:01+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  3:11AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I usually use my real name.

Instead, we'll have Presidential candidate A, who was raised by the current Plutocracy. He's been protected since birth from internet archival.  He's also been groomed since birth to aid the Plutocracy.  Then you have Presidential candidate B, who once as a 10 year old got on a forum and said he wanted to kill his teacher.

You're seriously saying that the defense against smear campaigns and artificial democracy is to cover your tracks and make that equally easy for everybody? Why in hell would I vote for somebody who doesn't have clear credentials as a human being in their past? What makes such a scenario even distantly attractive to you as a voter, to such an extent that you'd like to emulate the guy with the perfectly censored track record? Don't you find it immensely unfair that you're effectively discriminating against people with an Internet trail, making them second-class citizens?<br/><br/>No, to me it seems that your arguments support the opposite conclusion: Internet archival requires us to consciously take each other seriously as humans while ostracizing any attempts at artificial media manipulation that comes in the way. The other option is to effectively relinquish democratic power to an aristocracy willing to groom the sort of artificial candidates you describe. Aping that sort of practice in your own life isn't admirable, but rather to be pitied.<br/><br/>(I should note that I come to this from a non-American viewpoint.

Privacy is fantastic. In fact, I'm basically arguing for what we've had for centuries. Privacy protects us from Big Brother.  You may not be aware of this, but in countries like the UK and the USA, Big Brother is becoming a HUGE threat.  In the UK, they have CCTVs watching every street corner.  In the US, we have SCHOOLS handing out laptops with activated webcams that are recording students at home.  We have both Democrats AND Republicans maintaining the Patriot Act, a law which basically goes against everything America claims to be.  <br/><br/>The plutocracy HAS privacy. They always will. We can't take it from them. It gives them an advantage over every other person. It turns everyone with an internet trail into a second-class citizen.   <br/><br/>You are right, in America, elections prove how stupid we are. In 2008, 98.6% of Americans voted for a presidential candidate who was in favor of destroying American freedoms and increasing corporate profit at the expense of national wealth. They were more concerned about Obama secretly being a Muslim and Palin's lipstick than they were about the fact that both Democrats and Republicans wish to rob the country blind while removing our freedom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259501/#Comment_259501" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T00:11:26+00:00" title="March  2, 2010 12:11AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough, David. What about the part where you're effectively surrendering the moral issue of whether people should hold superficial media spin against each other? I'd rather see people learn to think better than require everybody to protect their privacy, not because of authority abuse, but because they'll be reviled in public by spin doctors. I mean, isn't it a problem with the society if they find what you said as a teenager somehow relevant to your political career? If you argue that the poor guy should just have had a better long-term media spin, to me that seems like you're actually advocating for and supporting the culture of superficial judgment that precedes your stance.<br/><br/>Privacy is an important tool as a strategic issue of protection against tyrants in a free society, on this I agree. It's not a moral issue, however, so trying to defend stupid media spin by accusing the victim of not taking care of his privacy is backwards. It's very much like accusing a rape victim of dressing provocatively, which is a very similar situation: while it might be strategically smart to not dress in ways that others will use as an excuse for horrible deeds, that does not in any way lessen the moral burden on the rapist. Likewise, I'd say that accepting superficial judgment of other people and using that as an argument for Internet anonymity is putting the fault on the wrong party: it's not my fault if somebody judges me unfairly for something I've said in the Internet, it's the fault of the person doing the unfair judging. That's why it is <i>unfair</i>.<br/><br/>The above sort of thinking makes me react with admiration when somebody gets in human rights trouble for their openness in the Internet or any other media - admiration of their willingness to get in the harm's way when they could've hidden away from the injustice by using the various cryptographic tools available to us. I also don't like it when people comment on that sort of event with derision, reminding others of how they should have taken care with their anonymity - while it is true that anonymity will protect us against many things, the very need for anonymity is nothing to be proud of. Use anonymity strategically and tactically in pursuit of the good, yes, but please, do not make it a standard of behavior that justifies oppression against those who for one reason or another choose to forgo it.<br/><br/>Thus: I would be the last to cast stones at the decision to engage in civil disobedience anonymously (although owning your actions is also a valid and powerful tactic, note). However, advocating anonymity in a hobby matter like <i>gaming</i> because it might be safer for your job in a stoopid corporate environment? On my own part I say, bring it on - if there's somebody out there who wants to do me ill for my gaming hobby, I'd rather face them directly and draw public attention to such wrongness. The existence of such discrimination (were it the case; I know of no such cases around here) would be an argument for clearly publicizing my hobby, not an argument for hiding it and thus giving way to a stupid form of discrimination. If everybody with a stake on something like gaming decides to hide their hobby in fear of discrimination, then it's no wonder if the hobby becomes an easy target for ill-doers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259559/#Comment_259559" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T07:12:52+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  7:12AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David C</cite>In the US, we have SCHOOLS handing out laptops with activated webcams that are recording students at home.</blockquote>\nYikes!<br/><br/>I just looked this up.<br/><br/>Yikes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259623/#Comment_259623" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T09:42:56+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  9:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a really long post written that was witty and articulate and then Story-Games ate it.

Thank god I used a handle to post everything, because that was What People Did On The Internet. It still took me about two years to completely disconnect myself from that old handle, but I'm glad that I did.

It's about controlling your first impression. When I was 14 I was gangly, pimply, didn't dress well, had bad hair and braces. 14 years later, I've learned how to dress well, how to style my hair attractively, and generally look moderately attractive and "together". In person I can control my first impression, because you're seeing me face-to-face - there's no way you're going to confuse me with the pimply awkward youth of 14 years past. But on the internet, if I "maintained ownership of everything I've said", I would have the first impression of that awkward 14 year old FOREVER.<br/><br/>I want people to get to know me for me. And then maybe I'll tell them that I used to write horrible Sailor Moon fanfiction and all of the other stuff that I haven't been able to totally expunge from the internet thanks to Usenet archives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259647/#Comment_259647" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T10:47:53+00:00" title="March  2, 2010 10:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2010 10:49AM by Wordman.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>...to me it seems that your arguments support the opposite conclusion: Internet archival requires us to consciously take each other seriously as humans while ostracizing any attempts at artificial media manipulation that comes in the way.</blockquote>\nHowever anyone might feel about internet archival and reputation and such, I submit that this really doesn't have much to do with real names vs. handles. The knowledge that some kind of archive may come back to haunt you applies either way. Here is why:<br/><br/>1) When using any name, real or made-up, you are still building <i>identity</i> (on the net, off, doesn't matter). That "archived trail" is attached to that <i>identity</i>, not the name. The <i>reputation</i> generated by that identity follows it around. For example, let's say that Eero <i>always</i> referred to himself on the net and in print as "Solar Guy", instead. Other than the name, every post he's ever made is exactly the same. Every game he wrote is exactly the same. Who wrote <i>Solar System</i>? Solar Guy. For the most part, the reputation associated with that identity would be the same. All that has changed is the <i>label</i> on the identity.<br/><br/>2) The notion of "change the name, change the reputation" doesn't hold up that long. It can work, but as soon as <i>anyone</i> makes known that "Eero Tuovinen" == "Solar Guy", the two identities merge into one, as does the reputation they both carry. True, this might not be 100% (some may remain ignorant of the connection), but anyone who really cares can figure it out. As an example, I use another internet handle sometimes; it would take someone about five minutes of Googling to figure out what it is.<br/><br/>3) Identities are unique; names are not. The real name gives no more of a guarantee of knowing the right identity than fake names do. Example 1: a number of "Wordman"s posted to usenet in the early '90s. One of these was me, who posted a lot about Shadowrun. Another was a neo-nazi fuck, who posted a lot about people with more melanin than him. Example 2: I am not the "Lester Ward" who smuggled 90 tons of pot into the US in a gutted 747, nor the one who wrote Dynamic Sociology. It isn't the name that defines the identity; it is the action.<br/><br/>In other words, I guess what I am saying is that if you went back and searched for "Wordman", you could build enough of a profile on "this-thing-called-Wordman" to reach conclusions about my behavior (and, most likely, enough to be able to filter out actions from "those-things-also-called-Wordman-but-not-the-Wordman-I-am-tracking" as well). Does it <i>really</i> matter that you don't think of this search as tracking "this-thing-called-Lester-Ward" instead? Or "this-thing-called-some-real-sounding-alias-like-Bob-Smith", for that matter? Behavior's the same either way.<br/><br/>The <i>only</i> thing different is the nature of the initial prejudice that you may or may not feel at seeing the label I present to you. It's almost exactly like clothing, in the sense that I can choose the wardrobe I present to you, and may even choose it to garner a specific reaction, but I have no control on how you actually react to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259653/#Comment_259653" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T11:25:36+00:00" title="March  2, 2010 11:25AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite> But on the internet, if I "maintained ownership of everything I've said", I would have the first impression of that awkward 14 year old FOREVER.<br/><br/>I want people to get to know me for me.

I had the same group of friends from when I was 17 to when I was 35 (when I moved across the country). Those people certainly saw me grow and change over the years. There's not a lot that I can hide from them. In many ways, I like that. There's a warmth and depth I feel in my relationships with those people.

I do understand that, and think that there are situations where it is justified; I also do not think that anonymity should be prevented in the Internet, but rather think that it's definitely the sort of thing that individuals should have the power to decide for themselves; you decide whether you want to be anonymous, I decide whether I should give a damn for your anonymous opinion. My claims, such as they are, concern only my own reasoning behind my own decision to use my own name in the Internet. And then I'm also asking hard questions off David because I'm fascinated about how he rationalizes his support for parochial social mores and ostracism based on ad hominem attacks.<br/><br/>Not one of you particularly needs my admiration, so there should be no need for you to care if I choose to admire the choice of getting in the harm's way in a human rights situation. I see it as an important part of keeping conscienses alive that some people at some time choose to do the right thing, no matter the consequences. You might see this as foolish due to how monolithic the opposition is or how little you believe in human nature (thinking of Jason's comment, above), but I do think that this doesn't undermine admiration - I can admire even a foolish gesture made for noble reasons. Any given person might choose to forgo the martyr's fate, but this is no reason to talk down the martyr, just reason to accept that we're not all suited to be so singularly uncaring of our fate.<br/><br/>(And in case Internet stupidity might take rein: I'm writing this with a smile on my face, and am not angry at anybody.

On the other hand you would frequently type 'Hi Dave' in local chat when you saw DeathBringer turn up, because you knew them and chatted with them often.<br/>This leads to me not caring whether people know my name on the internet, but feeling weird when the <i>system</i> identifies me by my name (The 'Hi Andrew' on Amazon still creeps me out). It's like... wearing a hat at home, or going shopping in pyjamas.<br/>Story Games is perfect for me, as the forum uses my username, but anyone can refer to me by real name if they can be bothered to rollover.<br/><br/>From what I understand of Facebook and Twitter and similar (not having used them) you use your real name there, so people introduced to the internet today probably won't form the same responses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260097/#Comment_260097" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T17:27:04+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  5:27PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another facet of this conversation made itself known to me tonight... There's been a correlation made between a user being a douchebag, and being anonymous, or hidden behind a user name. What observations have been made about a user being rude to someone ELSE who's anonymous?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen it. People who have normal interactions with people they have come to know online but who snap at the slightest provocation from a new user or an anonymous one. It's like the assumption is that the person on the other end of the computer isn't a real person, doesn't have real feelings, and thus isn't worthy of the same courtesy and consideration that the people you've come to know do, to include the people you don't necessarily like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example, the one in particular that brought the idea to mind, involves my wife. My wife got into a bit of a spat with a friend she knows both in person, and via an internet community. This friend recently posted about this fight, talking about how an "anonymous" member of the community had attacked her, called her a bad mom, etc. She doesn't name my wife, but it's blatantly obvious to my wife that she's talking about her. Hold it, I've not gotten to my point yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing is the reactions of the other members of the community. Many of these people are friends of my wife as well, as my wife is well-liked there.. But they are ripping into this "anonymous attacker" something fierce. My thought is that if the post were to have my wife's name on it from the beginning that these people would have had a very, very different reaction. But because the attacker is anonymous, it's okay to say nasty things about this person. If the post weren't anonymous, the things my wife's friend (if that's an appropriate word) said happened wouldn't be any different, but the context would vastly change the reactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260098/#Comment_260098" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T17:34:00+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  5:34PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lance: Yeah, you bet.

Life is too short to hold grudges, individual people are too complex to view as simply black or white.<br><br>Anyhoo...<br/><br/>"Ronin Zombie" is a silly name. The reasons I chose it are twofold.  <br/><br/>Firstly, it stores more information about me than my real-life name.  I came into this community without anyone here knowing anything about me.  I have used "roninzombie" elsewhere on the internet, and I like it because it advertises things that I really like: ronin and zombies (who doesn't, these days?).  And maybe it tells you something about my sense of humor, too.<br/><br/>Secondly, I have a very common first name.  "Michael"  is the most popular name given in the year I was born.  I routinely hear people say "hey, Mike" in public places and simultaneously assume they probably don't mean me but irresistibly look over and/or respond anyway (it can be embarrassing sometimes).  In fact, one year in college, all of the officers in our gaming club were named Mike. (They called us the "Mike-ocracy".)  For the sake of communication, it's actually easier if I go by another name.<br/><br/>My real-life friends generally call me by my last name.  No one has every called me "Ronin Zombie" to my face -- that would be weird.  If it would help others in this forum relate to me better, I would be happy to change my username to "Addison".                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

For all the reasons there are for saying people should use their real name, I don't think it's much other than people not being used to it. This is the internet age, and it's pretty hard to get your name in an email address. Some sort of unique sounding handle usually does the trick so that you're uniquely identifiable rather than one of 60 Joe Browns. Imagine going onto a larger internet forum, like Gaia Online and everyone using their real name. You'd be screwed, with so many posters you wouldn't be sure whom you're talking to. <br/><br/>Not to mention, using a fake name is a rather age old tradition, with mothers whispering the real name to their baby as they're born and then never telling them so there's no power over them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262543/#Comment_262543" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T12:36:35+00:00" title="March 17, 2010 12:36PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Age old among fantasy literature characters and African tribesmen, Robin.

If a person wants to be called by $str, and it's not offensive, confusing or otherwise sensibly off-limits, you can stick your 'real name policy' up your backside as far as I'm concerned. I'm lucky enough that not even the most controversial stuff I might post on-line wouldn't rebound on me professionally, but I'm well aware that in some occupations and countries (the US, I understand, has particularly poor employee protection) it's reasonable to use a nom de plume to eliminate any possibility that a jackass further down the line will make trouble for you. Nonce words can be more memorable than $forename $surname combinations, so that's another plus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had this handle since I first experimented with an on-line identity on h2g2, and long ago I decided to stick with it for everything I could. It's pretty such a part of my sense of identity these days that I get cross when a site insists on a username of at least 6 characters, or I find that someone got there before me (although, on occasion, I find that the person in question was me and I'd just forgotten about it). In fact, 5 of the top 10 results on google for 'Queex' are me, down from a peak of 7 a while ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, nicknames are a boon when differentiating between people with the same given name. At our gaming group, it's lot easier to refer to:<br/>\n<br/>\nLex, Alex, Cap'n Alex and Bruce<br/>\n<br/>\nthan Alex, Alex, Alex and Alex.

There's more flexibility for using numbers as words in Chinese, as you can write out an entire phrase or notion in a set of numbers that's phonetically identical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262786/#Comment_262786" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T11:52:20+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 11:52AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 11:52AM by Graham.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Migo, are you actually a Mi-Go?<br><br>If so, oh fuck.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262788/#Comment_262788" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T11:55:50+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 11:55AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 11:56AM by migo.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is what my handle is a derivative of.
