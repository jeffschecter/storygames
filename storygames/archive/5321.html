I like design. I love <i>Lacuna</i>'s design (because I am a ridiculous Lacuna fanboy) and My Life With Master's art. Both add to the games.<br/><br/>And, when it's expressed as "I love this art" or "I love this design", that's cool.<br/><br/>But I've seen "quality" become a second-order thing. Sometimes it's expressed as "production values". People say:\n<ul>\n<li>For $30, I expect better quality.</li>\n<li>Some consumers may think the quality could be improved</li>\n</ul>\nand so on. (I particularly hate the second version, since it generalises to "some consumers", when it means "I think the quality could be improved").<br/><br/>I wish people would say "I liked the art" or "I didn't like the design". Or "The art is pixellated" or "the art looks unrealistic" or "the art is cartoony, which seems inappropriate". Or "I found it hard to read" or "The designer decided to print two of the pages in mirror-writing, which made things hard to read".<br/><br/>See, I do understand the urge to talk about quality. Like, recently, I read a very poorly written book (not an RPG). But, if I reviewed it, I'd say "The sentences use too many adjectives" or "One word in three could have been deleted, maintaining the sense". Or, less helpfully but not <i>entirely</i> unhelpfully, "This reads like fan-fiction" or "The editor should have have been more strict". But I'd never generalise to an abstract quality like "quality".<br/><br/>I don't know.

You could use them to mean basically anything.<br/><br/><br/>I think quality is a fairly hollow shorthand, but I don't think it's entirely without use. See, I could say something isn't "print quality", and that's a way of shorthanding "it's not ready to be published, and its images aren't properly formated and embedded so that if you printed it they'd come out pixillated, also we haven't optimized for printers yet" or whatever. It's a word that can imply a set of standards, and it's useful when people understands the standards and why they are important. When people are using the word for different things, or being vague or hand-wavey about their usage, or simply ending their review at "it's poor quality" without any definition or unpacking or expansion, then the word breaks down and is counter-productive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119687/#Comment_119687" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T11:35:41+00:00" title="January 15, 2008 11:35AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2008 11:39AM by Graham.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

To rephrase a part of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>:<br/>"The [Quality] which can be described is not [absolute Quality]."<br/><br/>This comes from Pirsig's notions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_metaphysics_of_quality" rel="nofollow">Metaphysics of Quality</a>; and the simplest way to put it is that Quality is ascertained <i>prior to</i> any sensory inputs. In fact, sense impressions are structured around Quality impressions, which are then organized by the mind into things like "causality" or "form."<br/><br/>So, as pertains to this discussion, Quality is "just felt" or "just perceived" and all the effort to explain a Low or High Quality experience resolves around the sorting of impressions. Thus, an individual's priorities--production value, gameplay, attention to detail, sense impressions of the physical artifact--become the lens through which one makes statements about Quality.<br/><br/>Put simply: it's in the eye of the beholder, <i>precisely</i> because the beholder's eye only spots things that adhere to its priorities. Joe and Jason say as much, above, in that they recognize that the term is only useful "later" in the assessment, when priorities have organized sense impressions into judgments.<br/><br/>BUT, there definitely <i>are</i> publications which render Low Quality perceptions in the vast majority of viewers/readers. If one wants to make "low quality" or "high quality" statements off-the-cuff (i.e. with minimal clarification of the terms, else one might as well use the clarifications instead) then one would want to consider this hypothetical majority of viewers and only reference elements that provide Low Quality perceptions for such a majority. THUS, the phrase <i>is</i> ultimately useful, so long as one hews closely to "established standards of the majority" when employing the terms "loosely" or "in the common sense."<br/><br/>So, yes, everyone's different and has different priorities; but, no, that doesn't make a term like "quality" useless, it just makes its use tightly proscribed (i.e. can't be a "personal" definition based on an individual's priorities). Such proscription would be an excellent tack for this thread to take (IMHO, though it contradicts Graham's initial assertion that he'd "never generalise to an abstract quality like 'quality'.").<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119699/#Comment_119699" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T12:10:47+00:00" title="January 15, 2008 12:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>...one would want to consider this hypothetical majority of viewers and only reference elements that provide Low Quality perceptions for such a majority.</blockquote>\nFor rough (non-RPG-book) examples of this:<br/>The sensation ascertained when one sits on a hot stove is almost universally Low Quality.<br/>The sensation ascertained when one has a powerful orgasm is almost universally High Quality.<br/><br/>So, what elements of RPGs (as games, or as books or physical artifacts) are hot stoves and what are orgasms?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119700/#Comment_119700" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T12:11:49+00:00" title="January 15, 2008 12:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how anyone else uses the word, but when I start talking about "quality" it means that I'm talking about areas where I can't specifically explain why I like or dislike it because <i>I don't know</i> why I like or dislike it.<br/><br/>I know good art when I see it or good writing when I read it, so I can give you a specific opinion on a book's writing or art.

I'll name a couple names, but only for illustrative purposes -- I really don't want to get into an argument about why my perceptions are "wrong."<br/><br/>* An immediate, visceral understanding of what the game is trying to accomplish. I don't want to have to convince myself too hard, and I really don't want to be given a sales pitch by the creator. The game's concept and intent should feel like it's literally jumping off the page at me. So how does that happen? A mix of strong introductory writing and a clear visual presentation. "Clear" by no means "glossy" or "overproduced." <i>Dogs in the Vineyard,</i> for example, is a murky presentation in my eyes. From looking through it and reading the introductory text, I had only a weak idea what it's trying to accomplish. I had to learn it from someone who already knows how to play it. But it enjoys enormous goodwill in the SG community, so I'm willing to look past what I initially perceived to be a low-quality product. <i>Burning Empires,</i> as another example, is probably the most highly polished "independent" game available today. When it's in my hands, it looks, reads and feels every penny's worth of the $50 price tag. I have absolutely no problem splashing out on anything that comes out of BWHQ for this reason, regardless of price. Was <i>Blossoms</i> worth the $21 I paid for it? Fuck yes.<br/><br/>* A consistent experience once play starts. Go ahead and hide all kinds of cool little behavioral easter eggs in your design -- emergent ludic behaviors are the New Hotness and they are really fun to explore. But an inconsistent experience, to me, indicates poor playtesting. And poor playtesting, to me, ranks worse than poor editing. <i>Lacuna,</i> for example, is IMO poorly edited but produces a consistently brilliant play experience, for example.<br/><br/>* Written tone. Yes, totally subjective. I like clarity. I like immersive-style writing that isn't too self-conscious. I do not like puppy-dog enthusiasm, particularly when I feel like I'm being sold. I'm having trouble really getting excited about <i>Reign</i> for this reason, because Greg's written voice feels overenthusiastic to me. Feeling like I'm being told what a great time I'm about to have interferes with what I would otherwise feel is a "quality" product (clear presentation, well tested). Counterexample: <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> and <i>Spirit of the Century</i> are my first exposures to Evil Hat's voice, and I like that it's direct and thoughtful. It feels <i>professional</i> without sounding like bogus corporate-speak.<br/><br/>* Pandering. Games that feature mashups of many individually badass ideas feel chintzy to me, like they exist only to shake down the consumer. <i>Cthulhutech</i> features Lovecraftian horror, sci-fi and mecha -- that's like a burlesque show that also features magic tricks, a sporting event and political satire. <br/><br/>All that said, yeah, I really do wish reviewers and the general public were a bit more direct in their criticism. Less passive-aggressive. Less "some people feel X." Fuck that. What do <i>you</i> feel? What's your specific beef?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119879/#Comment_119879" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T09:47:58+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  9:47AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>* Pandering.

I mean that in all seriousness: the burlesque show you described perfectly fits the "Monty Python's Meaning of Life" school of kitchen sink badassery that made Con Air and Live Free Or Die Hard thoroughly enjoyable, High-Quality-Low-Intent fiction.<br/><br/>That's my $.02.
