Now, imagine doing that to the players during a session. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Ask about anything, preferably about how the characters perceive the world, and build on the information the players give.

As i mentioned in the OP, though I think a lot of/most games leave it implicit, and I think a lot of people (myself included) have gotten a lot out of games that state it directly.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412297/#Comment_412297" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T18:51:11+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  6:51PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AFAIK it first enters our particular world in The Mountain Witch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412312/#Comment_412312" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T21:52:30+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  9:52PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2013 9:56PM by Simon_C.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's my recollection too: "The Mountain Witch Trick".<br/><br/>But I also seem to recall being surprised that the text of the game doesn't actually explicitly advise you to do this. I might be remembering wrongly, and I can't presently find my copy. Does anyone else have one to hand?<br/><br/>I think it might have been one of those pieces of play advice that sprang up around the game, becoming canon without being part of the rules.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, it's different to "what do you do next" because the questions are about things which are usually outside the usual authority of players - "you see a head on a spike, whose head is it?" for example. It gives players the ability to create things which are usually the GM's remit. In The Mountain Witch this is explicitly provided for in the rules in the sense that you have authority to invent details so far as they pertain to your Dark Fate. In other games this is less explicit, and in my experience, often less functional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412314/#Comment_412314" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T21:59:58+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  9:59PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, in different games different players can say different things.

My text example said: \n<blockquote>Remember, your story focuses on the players and their characters. If they come up with an idea which is as good as (or better than) what you had planned or thought they would do, and you can adapt the story to conform to their ideas without ruining other parts of it or making major changes to the campaign world, do it.

My text example said: \n<blockquote>Remember, your story focuses on the players and their characters. If they come up with an idea which is as good as (or better than) what you had planned or thought they would do, and you can adapt the story to conform to their ideas without ruining other parts of it or making major changes to the campaign world, do it. The players will gain a great sense of accomplishment and heap praise upon you for your excellent GMing -- and you didn't have to do a thing but listen to them and react accordingly.<br/><br/>Similarly, when a player asks, "Is there a so-and-so nearby?", he usually has some neat idea in mind for using it, something you'll likely enjoy. Unless it's impossible for that object to be in that area, tell him yes. He'll feel like he's contributing to the story and the world, and you get to have fun seeing just what he has in mind.</blockquote>\nSo the first part is about following what the PCs do (i.e. "What do you do?") - but the second part is about creating external objects based on player input, which is definitely crossing that line, in my opinion.  <br/></blockquote>\nI still don't know what game that excerpt is from!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412493/#Comment_412493" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T19:52:07+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  7:52PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I would say that "Is there a so-and-so nearby" is more like what you do in Feng Shui and Adventure! and plenty of other cinematic/action games before that.</blockquote>\nYes, I'd agree with that.  I think those are definitely a part of the origin of "ask questions, use the answers" - it's part of the tradition of saying "yes" to the players in cinematic games.  I'd agree that Feng Shui and Adventure! are part of that tradition, going back to Champions / Hero System and James Bond 007.  \n<blockquote>I still don't know what game that excerpt is from!</blockquote>\nOops!  Sorry.  That's from the Hero System, 5th edition.

But after the book got published people recognized it as a very significant technique, both for tMW and for games in general. As Clinton mentioned, it became known as "The Mountain Witch Trick" for awhile, and then later as "Fishing". I believe it was then Vincent that distilled and re-articulated the principle---as he's great at doing---as "ask questions and use the answers".<br/><br/>Though I'm sure other people did it before me, for my part I can say that the asking questions thing was something I started doing spontaneously during playtests for tMW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412567/#Comment_412567" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T13:06:06+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  1:06PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tim.
