                    Over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=748&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">character death!</a>, a bunch of people joked about player death as part of the stakes. This isn't a thread about that, but it got me thinking.<br/><br/>Are there RPGs in which you can be eliminated as a player? That is, as part of the stakes of a conflict, can you lose your right to be at the table? What might be the benefit of such a system?<br/><br/>I'm sure there's lots of Social Contract stuff around this ("dude, masturbating at the table is SO not cool; get the fuck out of here!") but what about actual, viable rules?                </div>

                            Adam,<br/><br/>Player death, though not by that name, is one of the prime problems with many other sorts of games.  When you are eliminated from play, you are no longer able to participate socially, at least not to the same degree.  This is widely considered to be a problem with games like <i>Risk</i> or dodgeball.<br/><br/>The most common solution is for the games to be short so that elmination is a temporary setback.  You're out in dodgeball, but a new round will be starting in five minutes.  That sort of thing.<br/><br/>The problem with a roleplaying game is that they tend to be much longer than five or ten minutes.  Who wants to play a game in which they might be barred from participation for hours at a time?  Worse, what if you're the only person to be eliminated for the next 45 minutes?  What do you do in that intervening time?<br/><br/>If you still have some other way to participate, I'm not sure that you're really not still playing, just with an altered set of responsibilities.<br/><br/>Quick question: are you talking about a game where the players have to wander off when they are eliminated, or where they still sit in and act as audience and kibitz?  Or either?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>The weekend combat LARP that I could never convince my LARPing group to let me run basically went with this idea as its <em>strength</em>.</p>
<p>The idea was that you start off with 20 NPCs and 50 PCs.  As PCs die they become NPCs.  They don't get to go back to playing PCs, they don't get to have a lot of fun, they get to <em>serve</em> the remaining PCs as opposition.</p>
<p>PCs would level-up and power-up quickly enough to deal with the expanding hordes.  So they'd get very bufff, very quickly.</p>
<p>The goal was that at the end of three days there be only <em>five</em> PCs left, to take on a horde of now 65 NPC orcs (and dragons and skeletons and all sorts of heavy-costuming shit) in an apocalyptic kick-ass battle royale.</p>
<p>Yeah, 45 people go home in various shades of disappointment.  But five people have the greatest LARPing experience ever.</p>
<p>The whole question of "When is it reasonable to impose unhappiness X on person A in order to create happiness Y for person B?" is a hellaciously tricky one which is, I think, entirely tied up in the question of removing players' rights to benefit the group as a whole.</p>

                            Actually, Jared Sorensen, when getting changed to go Goth clubbing at Forge Midwest, mentioned the idea he had of a high-stakes high-drama "bank heist team" style game, complete with lots of doublecrossing and the like, where if your character dies in the game, and that's expected, you're out. Go home, you're done, whatever, you've expected to leave and never come back to the session(s). <br/><br/>As it was intended for campaign play, I thought it was hardcore enough to deserve the title, "Jared's Awesome RPG Wherein you Lose Your Friends for Real".  :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hmm...  There seems to be quite a bit of interest/excitement about this sort of thing.  Which is interesting since I've always seen it as a huge problem.  One of the reasons we (locally) don't often play games like poker or risk is the whole elimination thing.<br/><br/>We play, at least partially, to hang with our friends.  Why would we want our friends to stop playing with us?  Further, I don't find elimination games to be all that much more fun for the players who stay in.  I don't get much of a thrill at eliminating a source of adversity.  In fact, it often just makes the game easier since it means I have fewer people to worry about.<br/><br/>So, in the interest of learning new things, could someone explain where the added enjoyment comes from in these types of games?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas -- I'm curious why you include Poker.  It's really hard to actually get "out" in poker.  You just play until you're done, which is usually one guy saying "Okay, fellas, I've lost enough money for one night."<br/>

                            This thread reminds me on how multiplayer FPS games are structured.  Counter-Strike got huge *because* it imposed a substantial penalty for getting capped - you had to sit out the remainder of the five-minute round and watch your friends have fun.  Five minutes is <i>eternity</i>.  It is powerful motivation to take the game seriously, play cautiously, use teamwork, and learn how to Not Die.  <br/><br/>Contrast this with instant respawn games, which are much more common.                        </div>

                            Thomas, in any competitive game, being eliminated is powerful, because, as Jason points out, it's a very real stake. So, while being the eliminated person sucks, you still want to get into the next game and try again, because the play was more intense while you were in, simply because of the fact that you knew you might be eliminated. <br/>
<br/>
What is competition after all in games? I think Ron would point out that its a display of your personal superiority, which bolsters self-esteem because you can compare yourself to the populace favorably. In the player's mind they are more sexually attractive because they've proven that, if it were a real competition, they would he the fittest and would have survived. There's nothing more central to human behavior than actual competition, and game competition is the way we conduct "test" competition. <br/>
<br/>
Now, some people don't get off on competition as much as others, of course. It's been argued before that RPG players actually have created the non-competitive form of RPG play solely because they are misfits who generally don't like to be compared to others because the comparisons generally come up negative. Basically the "geek" factor - if you've never been a winner, it's hard to feel the thrill of the potential of winning such a competition. All you feel is the dread of the loss. <br/>
<br/>
I think this notion is of dubious merit, but it does point out that there are some for whom competition is more enjoyable than for others. For these people, elimination can be an intense stake that makes the contest more worth persuing. For others it's just a downside with no upside. <br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, the boardgame crowd will tell you that, as gaming is social and the goal is generally for everyone to have fun, that having a simple endgame condition that determines the winner is better than elimination. That is, basically, it's the same as everyone being eliminated all at the same time, right at the time where you either intend to cease the social activity, or to start a new session immediately.<br/>
<br/>
(In fact, their optimal endgame is such that anybody could come from behind at the last second - if you have a game where players are functionally eliminated well before the end, it's actually worse than being eliminated, because you have to go through the drudgery of continuing to play knowing you can't win. I know players who hate this so much, they'd rather quit than continue playing a game when it gets to this point. Even amongst those who do stay, often they fail to continue to compete as hard as they can - what's the point - and this can skew the outcome. If the game is competitive, it's important to have players competing as hard as possible until the very end of the game. Elimination does have the benefit that often it ameliorates this effect. That is players can at least play hard to say that they weren't eliminated.)<br/>
<br/>
But there's something to be said about elimination, again, in a very Darwinian sense. This is what elimination tournaments are all about. The person at the top of the pyramid of competition (formed by the brackets) has a reasonable claim that he's superior to all of the other people who competed. It's a means to have people compete indirectly with large numbers of people. Open field dodgeball (as opposed to team dodgeball), allows competition with a large number of people as well. <br/>
<br/>
I think you have to look at the individual designs. I personally take the competition out of RPGs, because I get plenty of competition from all the non-RPGs that I play. I think that there are few really good competitive RPGs out there. Note that competition in this sense is often not directly between players - that is, they compete only indirectly. Everyone agrees to help each other, and, in fact, some of the measure of success is how well one character helps the others. Which character is the MVP? In this case, character elimination with it's attendant player elimination is just one more measure of success along with player gratitude, power bumps, and other rewards. <br/>
<br/>
Most RPGs are quite sloppy about this (basically this is GNS incoherence). A few, like Rune for instance, do a good job at allowing players to compete even directly with each other. I'm not saying that this is a requirement; I think you could have a good competitive RPG in which there was no direct competition. But I will say that D&amp;D is probably the best example of this that I can think of, and I don't think it's a good example at all. That is, I don't think any really good cooperative/competitive RPGs have yet been created to date. <br/>
<br/>
And, again, I'm not going to design one. I feel that RPGs are best served by strictly cooperative play with a goal towards myth creation. And, since most people think RPGs are at least somewhat this way, I doubt that we'll see any really good RPGs of this sort any time soon. Strictly competitive ones, sure. But the cooperative/competitive mode is an extremely hard balancing act to pull off. The secret would be to ensure that the rewards for co-operating were always far greater than those for direct competition. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise you end up with, like many of my early D&amp;D sessions, with players simply killing off each other's characters. This is what PKing is in MMORPGs, after all. Anyone can kill a monster designed to be killed. But to kill a killer? That's the real challenge, and proves that you're superior to the real person behind the character. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I've been saying for a long time (to deaf ears, apparently) that the way to make a game where PKing doesn't occur is just what I said above; to have rewards that come more from co-operating than from competing. Like in real life. Yeah, ironic isn't it that all MMORPGs would have to do is to model real life more accurately, and all their problems would go away? <br/>
<br/>
Actually the sims are proof of this concept in some ways. I just registered my son on "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends" Awesome Big Fat House Party" in which you unlock things by doing chores, helping people out, and gaining "Citizenship" and "Popularity" ratings, and "Friends" who you can call on to help you out (Alex helped out Mac in the game, and later called on Mac to help him do his window cleaning chore). A game based on transactional analysis? <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, you get the point. Since most competitive RPGs are about who can kill what, or even who can accomplish what against whom, they don't consider the rewards of other acts in life. Since this is what these games are about, this is neither surprising nor wrong. It simply means that the cooperative/competitive model has never been done right to date. <br/>

Makes me think though - in my experience, the reward for cooperation tends to come out of robust settings. Specifically ones where the NPCs are strongly played by the GM, which means that players have th eopportunity to socialize and interact in such a way as to exchange favors, build a reputation and establish relationships.<br/>
<br/>
The irony of that, to my mind, is that if we dip into the well of dysfunction, I'd bet you would find more people who can't model that (because they don't quite get it) than are uncomfortable with competition.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when you combine the two potential dysfunctions, you end up with a sweet spot somewhere around cooperation with immediate gratification, as in tactical play.  Go figure.  :)<br/>

<br/>
That was actually intended as a whisper, but since I bollixed that, I'll clarify.<br/>
<br/>
A VERY cynical person might observe that the limits of NPC socialization are based upon the GMs understanding of how social interaction works.  Imagine the worst case scenario - the GM at 14, going through the very worst "everyone else but me is stupid and nobody understands me" phase of his life.  How is that GM going to play NPCs?  Most likely, he's going to play them in a way that fits his view of the world, so they'll either be fawning, stupid, or unimportant.<br/>
<br/>
In shot, if your GM is poorly socialized, than expect that his NPCs will be poorly socialized too.  This isn't a hard and fast rule, but it's something to watch for.  This, in turn, means that the rewards for cooperation with the setting (in contrast to within the group) are likely to be skewed.<br/>
<br/>
-Rob D.<br/>
<br/>
PS - Note that all of this assumes a style of played NPCs in contrast the NPCs as tools to further the player's story, which is both a very small and very large difference.  The role of the world outside your players is a huge point of difference in people's play experiences, after all.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>Good point regarding <i>Counterstrike</i>, but while 5 minutes is a significant period of time, it's not really a long one.  If that distinction makes sense.  That is, yeah, you're out, and yeah it sucks, but you know you'll be right in on the action in just a couple of minutes.  Contrast this with a hypothetical RPG which takes three hours to play, and which will only have one "round" played in this sitting, from which you are elminated.  You might as well pack up and go home.<br/><br/>Mike,<br/><br/>Good post.  However, getting back to the point at hand, and acknowledging that there is some thrill to being the "last man standing" so to speak, I would like to point out an important difference between the social situation of most roleplaying games and most tournaments.<br/><br/>Namely, tournament social situations tend to be fluid.  That is, you go to a tournament to play in that tournament, and if you get eliminated you have other plans/options.  In fact, it's common to just play pickup games of whatever the tournament is with other eliminated players.  So, if you're eliminated, you still have something to do.<br/><br/>Contrast this with most roleplaying groups/games, and you'll see that the same thing isn't true there.  Whereas in a tournament setting, being eliminated just means I go play with some of the other elminated people, in a typical roleplaying setting, if I'm eliminated there isn't anyone else to play with.<br/><br/>Looking back at my comment to Jason above, that can be pretty functional as long as the wait for getting back into the action isn't too long (however you want to figure that), but I don't think there are many (any?) roleplaying games designed for play of multiple sessions in one sitting.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Hardcore elimination role play: certainly an interesting idea. I think at some point, it might get less fun for the remaining players.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely one of the reasons I got into role playing was the coopertative, non-elimination nature. And I'll freely admit that the reason I like GMing so much is that it's the one way to guarantee you never sit out of play. Which I guess makes me some kind of hypocrite for running games that can result in sitting out of play.<br/>
<br/>
When I do play board games, I definitely prefer ones where elimination (and as noted the worse problem - effective elimination) is not a strong factor, or ones that I do well enough at to not be effectively eliminated, or ones where it can be hard to tell just where you are. I tend to do well at economic type games that I'm at least in the running (though they definitely feature effective elimination - and worse, require the effectively eliminated players still play hard, and not just hand the game to one of the top players).<br/>
<br/>
Playing poker until one person has all the money - now that's hard core. How many people quit the group after one or two sessions when they realize they aren't good poker players? The way I've seen poker played is either at a party, where elimination isn't bannishment, or occaisionally, when folks aren't playing for real money, I've seen the winner(s) stake those who went bust. What is the table talk level? Poker as I've seen it has always been somewhat of a social game (and I've never actually played, but have sat and watched, and kibitzed), so elimination isn't bannishment.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I see (for me) in RPGs so often is that elimination is bannishment.<br/>
<br/>
But one thing I definitely acknowledge is that some people do like the threat of elimination. Clearly single elimination tournaments would not be popular if people didn't enjoy them. Many tournaments of course go for a structure where the losers play each other, and so every one plays every round.<br/>

<p>Adam:  It would be totally beyond awesome to have a game where each session of play, some player must be voted out of the game, and where in-game events can give you immunity to expulsion, and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Yes, people would hate it (and each other) but it would be totally cool even so.</p>

                            One thing I was thinking is that the game might not last long past the first PC death. Since the party will be down a man, it will be harder and harder to meet the challenges.<br/>
<br/>
There might be a few logistics issues with sending players home. You certainly would have to game at a public location or the GM's home. Each player would need to have their own transportation. All the resources used in the game would need to belong to the GM, or the player providing them would have to be willing to let the GM continue using them once out.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would take a pretty special group for this to succeed.<br/>

                            Yeah, but if _that's_ the model you want, you just have eliminated players become the judges and peopel who create problems for the remaining players.  It makes dying/losing/elimination fun, and makes for very satisfying play.<br/>

                            Realistically, I'd transition eliminated players from "contestant" to "jury" or "audience." That is, they would still have investment opportunities and would still have input.<br/><br/>Has anyone ever seen the convention audience-participation games where people line up and a panel of probably-famous people sits up there and GMs for players, six or eight at a time, and basically try to kill them off as fast as possible. But if you can keep them entertained, they'll probably not kill your character. If they do kill your PC, though, you leave the table and the next person in line takes your place. That's player-death-stakes, essentially.                        </div>
