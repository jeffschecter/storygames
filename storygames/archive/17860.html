I know there is a big boardgame design community in Germany, and some Jeepform or Scandinavian style games going on in Denmark. Does anyone know anyone, or know anyone who knows anyone who could visit Trier?<br/>There's not really any funding to pay a guest speaker, but Trier is a beautiful place and rich in history, so... maybe you could make a trip out of it? I'll buy you dinner?<br/><br/>Skype sessions with some of you might also be possible (but the internet tends to be unreliable at this university, so I'll get back to you guys on that).<br/><br/>As to the content of the class, I'll make another post some time in the future, when I've better planned things out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404255/#Comment_404255" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-22T05:59:11+00:00" title="January 22, 2013  5:59AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The home city of my ancestors! <br/><br/>Chris Engle (formerly Engel)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404259/#Comment_404259" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-22T10:40:27+00:00" title="January 22, 2013 10:40AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!
