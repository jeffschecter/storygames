I think I've heard it from Luke Crane and Vincent Baker. I'm trying to grasp the idea, thinking that what they mean is that it's not the only thing that is happening when we play tabletop RPGs... but I can't really put my finger on this subject.<br/><br/>So...

This still gives a lot of options for choosing the best option for story purposes. What's more, some of the best moments in my roleplaying history have been moments where my character did something that seemed completely out of character, followed by trying to find out why they did that, and what that means. Especially powerful are scenes where even the character is surprised at what they did. I love it when games force me to do these things.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of games give me as a player a lot of power outside of what my character can control (director stance). So that power can't be used to roleplay my character scrupulously, and thus will be invested in making a better story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449502/#Comment_449502" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-15T11:27:17+00:00" title="November 15, 2015 11:27AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2015 11:28AM by lumpley.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It totally depends on the game!<br/><br/>RPGs are no single thing.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449508/#Comment_449508" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-15T20:56:39+00:00" title="November 15, 2015  8:56PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is definitely an issue for gamers everywhere.

For instance, many games have no interest in a conscious "story" at all, while still creating narrative. An old-school game of D&amp;D is a good example: you're here to get into the dungeon and escape with treasure, not to create story. And yet at some level there is a tradeoff between more fun/exciting character actions (in this case, climbing into the dungeon and braving terrible dangers) and less drama-producing actions (let's convince the local Duke to build a new fort near the dungeon site; within a decade or two someone will have blocked off or cleared out the dungeon).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449522/#Comment_449522" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-16T09:20:27+00:00" title="November 16, 2015  9:20AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Story happens" is what I usually tell my players.

When we wrote that, we were not all aware of the way the term "Story" had evolved in online discussions about RPGs. We were using those labels very casually to mean anything from scenario, in game events, plot elements the GM throws in to make the game more interesting and just the connective thread running threw the campaign. The Storylines mentioned in the operations chapter are more about introducing complications that make the character's lives away from the counter terrorism arena intrude. Fundamentally the game became more about Investigations and Missions in actual play (which is why the modules all have a kind of sandbox structure to them). <br/><br/>This was our first venture into publishing on our own, and there was a bit of a gap in my opinion between the promise of the text and what we were actually doing at the table with the game and the mechanics (partly because we were just aping the rulebooks we'd been reading our whole lives without giving it a lot of reflection). Really the modules and the agency book are the best guides for what the game is meant to do (more so than the rulebook which, judging by the emails I got, confused a number of people who didn't seem to know what a Terror Network campaign was supposed to look like---and this is something we tried to address in the agency book). <br/><br/>If people want to use Terror Network for creating stories that is cool. But I think it would be misleading for people to buy it thinking the mechanics are designed to help them tell a story or that that is the central focus of the game (most of the mechanics in Terror Network are focused on managing a counter terrorism investigation). Telling a story can certainly be the focus of play if that is what people want, it can also be part of  a much bigger pie. But I wouldn't call it the central activity of the game. Given how loaded the term is in these conversations, if I were to revise Terror Network, the language would be more carefully crafted in that respect. I wouldn't completely avoid the word, but I'd be more careful about how it was addressed. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449559/#Comment_449559" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-17T22:11:46+00:00" title="November 17, 2015 10:11PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the elephant in the room, I mean one of many elephants in the room.  <br/>There's like a whole herd!<br/>RPG's are pretty terrible at telling(formulating?) what most people recognize as stories.<br/>There's a shit-ton of reasons for this.  <br/>I'm not gonna go into specific reasons, because I'm lazy.<br/><br/>I think there's a way to do it better.

If more than one, POV tends to switch per-chapter. Concentrating on one POV at a time lets themes develop. The author controls pacing carefully to maximize emotional impact for the reader. A good story has something of a mystery or question to it, to avoid predictability so the reader doesn't get bored. What will the character do? How will this story turn out? A lot of stories interweave themes and foreshadowing and other devices.<br/><br/>Most RPGs don't really facilitate that. You have 3-5 characters all vying for screen time, without really sharing spotlight. Pace is haphazard, especially in traditional games, unless there's a certain amount of railroading happening. Predictability is often a problem, except for the "will they succeed?" question, but even that gets forced sometimes. Themes and foreshadowing are usually accidental.<br/><br/>Some notable exceptions: Primetime Adventures, Annalise, My Life with Master, and Fiasco have strong POV rules. These help with pacing, too. Misspent Youth has excellent pacing / story-arc rules. Annalise's "claims" rule is basically a foreshadowing device for modern horror. Themes crop up in design, especially certain modern "Narrativist" designs, and they seep into play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449575/#Comment_449575" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T16:44:18+00:00" title="November 18, 2015  4:44PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2015 4:56PM by Nathan_H.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Nathan,<br/><br/>Why do you think RPGs are terrible for creating stories?</blockquote>\nThey're just different forms.  They don't follow much of a structure like stories do.  <br/>Self-contained games like say My Life with Master, The Mountain Witch, Fiasco come ...maybe close?  Closer?  By closer I mean really shitty not-quite-stories with the barest of character development, very little set-up and pay-off, with somewhat obvious plots.<br/>I think games where there's one main protagonist can come kinda close at aping story?  Maybe?    <br/>And just to be clear, I'm perfectly fine with RPGs being their own thing.  <br/>I'm cool with a platypus being a platypus.<br/>I would never sit through an RPG made directly into something like a film or television show.  I've enjoyed many episodes of television that have shown Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but what they show onscreen, isn't really the game.  The activity shown usually represents the inner struggle of something introduced before.  The game parts of the episode just show the character's inner struggle manifested.  <br/>I could bring up episodes of television?  The game parts function well because of bleed.  Real-life problems getting solved through fantasy.  It's meta; a story within a story.  Story, is dressing up real world problems in order to better deal with them.  It's all of art; a lie used to tell a greater truth.  <br/>Games teach you about the game.<br/>Stories teach you about life.<br/>I'm really generalizing, but it's pretty much the case.<br/>Games distill a part of life down to it's essentials(war, farming, capitalism).  <br/>Story does the opposite.  It expounds through narrowing it's focus. <br/>It makes mountains out of molehills.  It focuses on the small details of life, and makes them feel universal.  <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449576/#Comment_449576" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T16:51:36+00:00" title="November 18, 2015  4:51PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No RPG in the past 10 years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that I have played</span> comes close to the elegance of story presented within an episode of Cheers.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449577/#Comment_449577" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T17:00:51+00:00" title="November 18, 2015  5:00PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2015 5:11PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks!<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree with you, but that might be a question of nature vs. quality. Is the story produced in a (story-oriented) game basically different in <i>nature</i> (as you argue - games are about conflict, stories are about the universal) or simply different in <i>quality</i> (we didn't put as much effort into making our game session as good as Cheers, aren't as good at writing as the writers of Cheers, or we don't have the benefit of after-the-fact editing)?<br/><br/>I see no reason - theoretically - why a story game can't produce good stories, unless that logic also applies to a writer's room, improv theatre, or any other kind of improvised story medium. (There's no question that editing and refining will tend to create a more polished product than the original, rough form it took.)<br/><br/>I also wonder if it's entirely fair to compare one person's gaming history to one of the most successful media creations of all time. Or do you think that the story produced by some super-awesome story gamers who are totally on fire and getting deep with each other compares poorly to even the worst episodes of a third-rate television show no one likes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449578/#Comment_449578" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T17:08:53+00:00" title="November 18, 2015  5:08PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was some interesting (although occasionally thorny) discussion about the role of improvisation vs. preparation <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-don-t-get-it/p1" rel="nofollow">not too long ago, in this thread</a>.

A story to me means a sequence of events which happen, but RPGs are a game so the players will almost never do the sequence needed to tell the story as written. So I create NPCs/situations that create conflict and let the story develop out of however they decide to confront it. In a sandbox game I may have 3 or 4 points of conflict for the players to run into and decide on reacting too. In a more structured game I have a central point of conflict and a fixed setting and let them deal with it. <br/><br/>I think railroading happens when there is a set story that require a specific sequence of events for it to happen. <br/><br/>So I think story is what we make out of the sequence of actions and events that happened in the game.

Those two get planned and rehearsed and edited and refined before the audience sees them; an RPG session does not.  Watching a story-strong RPG session is like spending 30% of your time reading a novel and 70% of your time watching the novelist brainstorm or goof off, something that I doubt any novel-reader would  do.<br/><br/>2) In retrospect, summarized after the fact, some RPG sessions and campaigns are every bit as satisfying to remember and think on and share as good movies or novels.  I've played games of Fiasco that I remember as fondly as Burn After Reading.  I've played long homebrew campaigns that I recall more favorably than the Chronicles of Amber (and I loved Amber).<br/><br/>3) The design spec for "Story Now" RPGs seems to me to be simply about tweaking that 70%-30% ratio.  Whereas a dungeon crawl with no interest in exploring any sort of compelling human crisis might produce satisfying narrative developments at only the slowest and most erratic pace (99%-1%), a focused game of Sorcerer or Primetime Adventures might reliably exceed that 70%-30% mark .<br/><br/>I'm sure this isn't a new formulation, but this seemed like a good spot for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449609/#Comment_449609" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-19T21:11:50+00:00" title="November 19, 2015  9:11PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2015 12:46PM by Rickard.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Story is the emergent narrative we tell after we played the game.</blockquote>\n... or that we form by interpreting what's going on.

It's not like, but it can be compared to -trying to make a story with several handicaps:<br/><br/>-Several people intervene, so as much as you would like, you don't have full agency or even agency enough to focus on important parts of the story, like the theme, character development, coherence, etc.<br/>-Nobody (most of the times not even the GM) has full access to all the information available all the time. Players can keep plans and thoughts secret, there's randomization of conflict resolution which in turn may affect narrative rhythm.<br/>-(on most games) you can't freely go back time, replay scenes nor rebuilt them in any way to enforce some of the aspects mentioned.<br/>-Everyone is expecting entertainment and even have different expectations about it. Also, they have agency enough to try and push their expectations into the game. Like the guy who starts a fight when everything was set up for a tense diplomatic scene.<br/><br/>So, no wonder good, deep interesting RPG game stories are rare. It's still possible for those to happen because there are groups that click, with the disposition to mix their individual talents into memorable moments. Like the GM who adds that incredible twist in the right time, the player who takes that as a cue to roleplay her character so amazingly everyone forgets for a moment it's a fictional character or the quiet guy who suddenly came up with the idea that saved everyone's neck without pulling up a fight.<br/><br/>Also, some games add procedures with better chances to help groups collaborate into making more deep material, or plainly call for players more prone/used to collaborate into a good impro.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris" title="ericvulgaris"><img alt="ericvulgaris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nJV8DKZOO3TSE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris">ericvulgaris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449613/#Comment_449613" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-19T22:16:52+00:00" title="November 19, 2015 10:16PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Story is the emergent narrative we tell after we played the game.</blockquote>\n... or that we form by interpreting what's going on.

Stories don't all need to follow the Hollywood 101 structure. They can look like all kinds of things. When I'm playing a game ...<br/>* with a social contract explicitly stating that we're telling a story,<br/>* which has rules forbidding any speech which is not part of the narrative during scenes<br/>* with tools that support developing themes, story arcs and pacing<br/>* with players experienced in playing such games and equipped with all those implicit techniques for making it work<br/>... I really feel that we can get some really good stories going. We'll never show a gun in act one and not fire it in act three. We'll never have pointless digressions that don't tie into the theme. We'll make some good stories that we enjoy, because we're the ones making them, and the structure might not be clean and polished all the time, but the same is true of some of the best movies and books I know. Stories aren't just this rigid thing. They can have loads of different structures. <br/><br/>Often the point of the game is not telling a good story, but sometimes it totally is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449695/#Comment_449695" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-22T18:41:26+00:00" title="November 22, 2015  6:41PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Since I wrote Terror Network, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things regarding the use of the word story and storyline in the rulebook.

If you find story gets your meaning across to your audience, then go for it. And if you find Terror Network helps with play you'd use the word story to describe, go for it. This isn't about vomiting blood or going berserk, it is about expectations. For me it is a matter of clarity and the word 'story' created some issues there. While I agree for most gamers who are not as into the online discussions it is still used fairly loosely to mean a number of different things, a lot has happened in the hobby and there are communities who use it in a particular way. I carried that banner for a while of trying to reclaim the term online to its more general use, but it really seems to mean something rather specific to a number of different groups. It can be a confusing word for that reason. Also because it is a sort of malleable word for many gamers, it does lack precision, so even there I've learned to explain what I mean when I use it. If I drop the word story into my GM advice section a number of people will read it to mean railroad, others will read it to mean narrative mechanics, while others will read it to mean putting story as the first or only consideration when ruling on outcomes. None of these match well how I actually play, or what I imagine my games doing for people at the table. That doesn't mean conflict, drama and characters are not a part of my game, but it does mean I give very little consideration to things like pacing (a particular pet peeve of mine as a player and GM), making things feel like an actual story, etc. I would describe my style as a combination of character-driven-vaguely sandbox and situational GMing (as described by Clash Bowley), where the situations flow naturally from the NPCs and groups in play. If I could use the word 'story' to convey that to people, I would. I just don't find it works well for a large enough segment of the people who read our books to do so. So when I am making games, that is typically the kind of play things are designed around (obviously people can play the games however they want, but just in terms of the environment the games emerged from, it could be misleading for me to emphasize story. Terror Network was play tested around sessions that looked a lot like the module the Patriot Incident. Given that there is a whole segment of RPGS called story games, it can definitely help to at least be careful when using the term if you are writing an RPG book (I am not interested in policing language, so if people want to use that word, they should feel free, I've just found throwing it out there with little clarification can create confusion among my readers). <br/><br/>I just wanted to clarify Terror Network as I don't want people buying it thinking they are getting a system designed for something it really isn't (and I've received emails from people confused about a number of things). When I read Terror Network now, while it is a game I am very proud of in a lot of ways, there are things about it that I would like to change (almost none of it is mechanics though). The GM advice and talk about story, to me reads more like how things were written in the 90s (which is what I cut my teeth on so it makes sense). I would have liked to have put more thought into that stuff, because even as I was writing it, I had long moved away from a lot of that kind of thinking (my GMing style changed pretty radically around 2006 as a result of frustration with railroading and adventure path style play; as well as play designed around encounters and challenge ratings that was really common in 3E). But I hadn't really figured out how to talk about that in a way that reflected my style and with Terror Network I was writing the way I thought you just had to write stuff. Like I said, it was our first effort. I learned a lot about what we were communicating to people following its release (because we were largely just writing the way we talked in our own game group). <br/><br/>Again, if the word works for you, I am not telling you that you should use another term. I'm not out to eradicate the word story. I've simply found it is a word that mislead some people if you are not careful. If I were just talking with my gaming friends, I wouldn't think much about its use. When you write a rulebook, the readers just have the text, there is no follow up question for clarifying what you mean. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449722/#Comment_449722" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-23T21:56:13+00:00" title="November 23, 2015  9:56PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2015 9:56PM by AsIf.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In common parlance it's a fuzzy word, like <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> both are pointing out, albeit in different tones of voice.  What's the story, morning glory?<br/><br/>In academe there is still a literary distinction between the words "story" and "narrative", even though the literature of the last few decades has put both words through many mutations and pushed them into blurry areas.  The "multiple points of view" thing, for instance, as well as the "no master narrative" thing, are both common features of postmodern fiction, which, if you think about it, is what most RPGs create.  RPG is a postmodern medium that produces postmodern fiction.  (Of course, this can be a tricky basis for an argument - a lot of people don't read postmodern fiction because they think "big books are scary.")<br/><br/>So...  I agree with both of you.  In common use, just go ahead and say it.  But if you use the word within a rulebook, you need to explain how you mean it.

Because once people go from loosely using the term story to indicate "stuff of various kind that happens in the game" to "story=literature or narrative", there is the inevitable "If story is the aim, then the outcome of a good session or a good system is a good story". But that produces something that has very little interest to me as a player or a GM. Once people pin you to the idea of story being at the heart of play, then they start using that as a metric of good design or good GMing. And I find I often want very different things from play than the people who make these sorts of arguments. I don't think there is anything wrong with taking a story approach, but I do think there is this equivocation that occurs around the multiple meanings of "story" in discussions, and in its most extreme form it leads to stuff like the "D&amp;D is not a roleplaying game" claim in the Chess in not an RPG article.

I weighed in because a game I design was brought in as an example of one that places story as a central focus and I felt it was important for me to clarify what we meant by story, that I don't really use the term any more to describe my play style because it has evolved to mean something else online.  <br/><br/>Fundamentally I agree people come to RPGs for all kinds of different reasons. I raised the point in my second post because I think folks often misread what a typical gamer means when they say 'I play for the story' and that was relevant to why my game got brought into the discussion. It can be used to rhetorically trap people to a style they aren't interested in because it is so easy to equivocate. So I avoid the term or I use it but explain what I mean by story. I don't care if people want to use my game for storytelling or narrative play, but I don't want folks to buy it thinking it's a Story RPG, when it really doesn't supply that (we used the word story in a very 90s sense of the word). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449739/#Comment_449739" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-24T22:41:50+00:00" title="November 24, 2015 10:41PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps we can ameliorate that misunderstanding by placing the word "emergent" before the word "story"?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449740/#Comment_449740" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-25T00:00:39+00:00" title="November 25, 2015 12:00AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Perhaps we can ameliorate that misunderstanding by placing the word "emergent" before the word "story"?<br/><br/></blockquote>\n<br/><br/>In my own case and in the specific case of terror network, I would still be cautious simply because the word has so many expectations built into it now in the gaming community. Adding emergent, if I understand your meaning, might lend clarity, but I think it'd would also just cloud things enough that I'd still avoid it now unless I had room to expand. <br/><br/>I wrote this blog post on the subject about a year ago: <a href="http://thebedrockblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/what-is-role-playing-game.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thebedrockblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/what-is-role-playing-game.html</a><br/><br/>However email responses I got to it, suggested to me that it just created more confusion than it solved. So I've just come to believe, at least for me and my games, the word isn't a helpful indicator of content to enough people that it is worth avoiding. It think part of it is how fragmented the hobby is now online around different play styles people often look for key terms to find things they like and avoid things they know they don't. Story is one of those words. In an ideal world it wouldn't be so, people would automatically know that I mean a much more casual sense of the word. But I can't have conversations like this with every person who reads my GM section or the back of my books. And I legitimately worry about people spending money on one of my games thinking they'll get one thing, when it really provides something else, so I've just become more aware of what words I use to describe them. By the same token, I worry about people not buying them because we fail to convey what the games are mean to do. That said this is just what I've found in my own case with my stuff. If 'story' or 'emergent' story conveys what you want to your audience you should use those terms.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449743/#Comment_449743" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-25T06:21:20+00:00" title="November 25, 2015  6:21AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've come to realize that a game talking a lot about "story" is not at all an indicator that it's the kind of game I'll enjoy (I like the story-focused games as Bredan describe them).

This is another reason why I avoid the words story or plot without explanation. What I meant by the GM controls the plot is he or she controls the stuff that happens outside the players (GM controls the NPCs, the surrounding events, etc). That doesn't mean he ignores character decisions. But by using the word plot it caused some people to interpret it the way you did. By the same token, in other places where it said story and storyline some people interpreted that to mean that the central focus of play was story (as JD Corely interpreted it in the earlier post), that it is a story RPG, or that it was about the GM weaving a story for the players to experience. So for me, there are just too many different interpretations of the text because of that language. That is why we increasingly avoid the terms story, plot, etc in our other books unless more explanation is provided.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449751/#Comment_449751" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-25T14:45:50+00:00" title="November 25, 2015  2:45PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with this.

My concern is I've just heard from enough people who were confused by the language of that paragraph and the GM section (even after I defended it myself last year) that I would be reluctant to phrase it the same way again. Also I think when you state it the way you did earlier (that story is the "central activity of play") a lot of people will read that as the purpose of play is to collectively construct a compelling story or something similar, which isn't what we were trying to say there.  I don't know that is has a central activity but if I had to pick one, I'd say the central activity is fighting terrorism (which could take many different shapes and approach from plot driven play to sandbox to a very tactics heavy operation). Even then I'd be reluctant to use that language, simply because when you assign a "central activity" it implies an exclusion of other activities or focus (and we make a point in most of our books saying, once you buy it, you can run it however you like). <br/><br/>I hope this doesn't come across as me being difficult, as that isn't my intention at all. If you like the game, I'm flattered. If you have good things to say about it, I welcome that. But when we released that game, I was inundated from people who genuinely had no idea how to play based on what we said in the rulebook. It was pretty much the most common subject of emails I received. I, in turn, was confused by the emails at first because I didn't understand people were taking story literally rather than more as a metaphor. There was all kinds of confusion because we used story and storyline in our language so a lot of people were expecting adventures to play like episodes of 24 and were writing to me asking how to make that happen. But our adventures in house were always based on newspaper headlines and built around investigations with event timelines. I was literally going to FBI offices and interviewing agents to find out how investigations were conducted and trying to make stuff based off that, but just a tad more exciting. This is why I wrote the post last year, to address some of that confusion, and ultimately why I've decided the word just isn't a good fit when I'm talking about the game publicly. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449753/#Comment_449753" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-25T16:21:22+00:00" title="November 25, 2015  4:21PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some techniques that might be misused into railroading can be put to good use in many RPGs as long as the players and GM understand and respect the limits, rights to dream, agency, fun and tastes of each other, which is a lot easier if said limits are defined before the game.

There are no techniques in the book that would really be construed as railroading devices as far as I can remember. But the way I used the word plot, could have been misinterpreted to mean the GM ought to railroad for story purposes. All I was doing in that paragraph was trying to describe to new players what a GM does (and I was trying to stick to the most basic description of GM and Player roles). So it was more of a communication issue.<br/><br/>Techniques are a whole other discussion I believe and one where there is probably a lot less confusion and debate (as long as folks are respecting different tastes and preferences) because you really start getting into specifics when dealing with techniques at the table. <br/><br/>I would agree that techniques aren't bad on their own, that knowing what the group's expectations and preferences when deciding which ones to use is important.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

Have you even played an rpg at a game convention more then once?  For example, someone "runs" a scenario with a buncha pre-generated characters.  You play in it once.  You loved it so much, you go back and maybe play a different character in it(or the same one).  I'm not saying this is the regular way people at home play role-playing games.  <br/><br/>I'm not even bought on the fact that a story is made during a role-playing game.  I mean, a bunch of things happen, over a set period of time, but they don't resemble what most of us will agree is a story.  Hopefully. I'm not speaking for most.  I mean, it's not like I've fact-checked this, but I believe it to be the case.<br/><br/>I mean, being creative with people, in a social setting has it's own merits, but I'm not gonna call role-playing creating a story.  Words come with built-in qualifiers.  Words like story have meaning.  The word story, let alone what humanity views as story has been around for a long time.  It's not like I'm talking about hip-hop.  I get that story is a word for a thing that is not always clear, but I think most of us could generally agree what is or isn't one.

Because it's hard to discuss your claim as it is. I clearly agree with you if we're comparing games like D&amp;D 4E or Apocalypse World with stories like The Lord of the Rings and Mad Max, but there are different kinds of games and different kinds of stories.<br/><br/>There are games I have played with very tight storylines, where characters have themes that develop, where all loose ends get tied up, where there is next to no action that doesn't serve a purpose, plot- or theme-wise.<br/><br/>And on the other side of the equation, if you write down the in-fiction events of a game of Zombie Cinema and gave it to someone to read and asked them "Is this a story?", of course people would say "yes". "Story" is an extremely broad word and there are so many stories out there that have all kinds of crazy and idiosyncratic plots and techniques. And, of course, stories are not just told by professional storytellers like authors or scriptwriters.<br/><br/>To suggest that there is not a huge overlap between the things that tend to happen in RPGs and the things people would describe with the word "story" is really weird to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449799/#Comment_449799" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-29T02:18:20+00:00" title="November 29, 2015  2:18AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2015 2:18AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But our adventures in house were always based on newspaper headlines and built around investigations with event timelines.

I hear you.</blockquote>\nI think it is a big combination of things unique to the hobby itself. It isn't good or bad, it just the way things developed. I think it is my responsibility to figure out how to communicate with my readers. It doesn't do much good for me to blame people if they are confused by the words I select. Unfortunately story has become a legitimately confusing term to a lot of folks if it isn't clarified. And this is something that has just become clear to me with each book we release. It is also bound up in a number of arguments, getting used as a football over things like play style and the best way to design a game (and a lot of that turns on the various meanings the word affords). <br/><br/>Even if it wasn't a hot button word that set off debates or whatever, there clearly is a style of play and type of design that is focused on story (which is why you have forums like Story-Games.com. I was entirely unaware of this fact when I made Terror Network. I had gotten whiffs of it by poking around online and occasionally seeing stuff like the forge, but it never really absorbed that there was this subgenere of the hobby. So it is understandable people might get confused if you say something like the focus of play in Terror Network is story. Some might see that and just think it is story in the way it was used in the 90s (which really just means roleplaying is important or the GM is kind of going to railroad a plot) or they could take it to mean its a story RPG. I simply meant it in the sense that fun stuff happens and drama naturally flows from the characters doing things and the GM throwing things at them. <br/><br/>I've enjoyed this discussion though because it has forced me to take a second look at some things. Thanks to this conversation I just re-read Terror Network actually. So that has lead to some good insights for me. What we really should have stated in the rulebook was that the focus was investigations (because that is actually an assumption running through the book now that I read it again). It is built around that. That doesn't exclude other things from arising or other play styles being used. But the hardest thing to deviate from with the game, in my view, is the assumed investigative structure of the adventures. The other issue in the game, that someone looking for story might object to, is the intentional lethality of the system. We cover this quite a bit and basically players are, in a sense, deprotagonized by the mechanics and the GM advice (GMs are instructed to let players characters die and all NPCs and PCs die just as easy). What we do say is don't let a good death go to waste. So there is nothing wrong with squeezing some drama or plot developments out of a death (i.e. Special Agent Diego was was shot and killed but he got a glimpse of the suspect's face and is able to share that before he dies). <br/><br/>These days, I use the word "drama" more to describe that aspect of play in my games where they occur. It feels less tethered to things like assumptions about plot structure or potentially connected to a particular style of play. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449807/#Comment_449807" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-29T18:58:22+00:00" title="November 29, 2015  6:58PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still maintain that the best thing to do is to strive for clarity.

But it wouldn't be fun to watch if the improvisers weren't trying to tell a good story.</blockquote>\nI think this touches on where the term story starts to negatively impact my enjoyment of play, or least my enjoyment of online discussions about play and design. Because once people go from loosely using the term story to indicate "stuff of various kind that happens in the game" to "story=literature or narrative", there is the inevitable "If story is the aim, then the outcome of a good session or a good system is a good story". But that produces something that has very little interest to me as a player or a GM. Once people pin you to the idea of story being at the heart of play, then they start using that as a metric of good design or good GMing. And I find I often want very different things from play than the people who make these sorts of arguments.</blockquote>\nI had a chat on RPGnet recently about whether there's a real tension between "literature or narrative" story-play and "the sense of being somewhere else where anything can happen" immersive play.  A <i>lot</i> of the replies centered on techniques.  Basically, it wasn't so much the <i>aims</i> of story-prioritizing players that gave immersion-seekers trouble, it was the <i>tools</i> of the games they preferred.

When it comes to design discussions, I will occasional find the same thing either in discussions of my own approaches to design or in talking about other games (i.e. this game isn't good because it doesn't do X). Don't get me wrong, I like a good debate and to hear conflicting views. I just don't like it when a particular word gets used to equivocate and confuse a discussion (intentionally or unintentionally----this happens with other terms too). <br/><br/>That said, I am probably someone you could label an immersionist. I am also a mod at Therpgsite and a poster there (which is pretty much an immersions forum). As immersionists go, I may not be the best person to ask that question because there are people with much stronger views on the subject than myself but I will do the best I can to answer for me and try to give answers for immersionists in general (just a sidetone, I think few people I'm thinking about here would actively label themselves immersionists). <br/><br/>I think techniques, approaches to GMing and mechanics can all potentially disrupt immersion. But you will find the line varies a lot from person to person, and often the explanations are made after the fact (something bothers someone, they think about it, and decide it was because it disrupts immersion---but not everyone will have that experience with a given technique or mechanic). The big ones people mention are anything that forces you to make a decision out of character. My old business partner used to hate Bennies for this reason (despite liking Savage Worlds a lot). He hated them because A) He felt they took him out of his character's head space and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> He felt they were this extra thing that wasn't connected to what was going on in the setting (he also didn't like the way they were handed out). However, he was perfectly happy to play 4E and I found that to be a game that seriously disrupted my immersion in a way no other version of D&amp;D had before. I don't want to rehash old arguments but just in my experience stuff like martial powers that were not at will, really mucked with me. <br/><br/>Another thing you'll hear from folks is stuff around GMIng (explanations for reaching certain decisions for example). Instances of this would be "say yes" or "fail forward" (these can also be built into the rules themselves). People who are into immersion generally want to feel like they are there in a world that is separate from there character. If the GM creates things in response to the players asking if something is there, for some folks that disrupts the realness. Fail Forward confclits with some peoples' sense of immersion because it places story as the measure of where things should go rather than basing it on what should happen logically as an outcome of failure. <br/><br/>Opinions do vary here though. There is also a split between people who basically want a setting and game that feels more real world. Not realistic and simulations necessarily, but a more grounded world like our own (even if the mechanics used to achieve it are abstract and simple). For that crowd too much genre physics will be disruptive. <br/><br/>However some folks, and I include myself here, like genre physics and genre emulation when that is what the game calls for (not all games call for it, so in some I'd find it odd). Here I am okay with building physics into the game that emulate the way things work in genre (so having rules for 1 hit guards, having heroes who grow in health and are hard to kill the more they advance, etc). I want the world to feel real around my character, but I don't mind if that world abides by the physics of an action movie or Doctor Who. <br/><br/>So in forums or tables where immersion is a big deal you might see a lot of debates over games like Numenera (which some immersions like but others have issues with). The same with games like Doctor Who. A game like Gumshoe can often be an issue for people as well (I've played it and think it is well designed/well written but there are things with the system that really muck with my GMing style----and a couple of my players had similar issues from their side of the table....I ran it as-written so I could experience it the way it was intended to be played). Interesting and cool game, but just not for me. And some games will be total non-starters for people (4E often is, anything with heavy narrative mechanics will be as well). <br/><br/>These days, I try to be pretty easy going on this stuff. Rather than walk around with an idea that certain types of mechanics or approaches will disrupt my immersion, I only worry about it if I notice in play. I figure some games might have things that in theory would be an issue, but they are not present in enough volume to attract my attention. Sort of how like when people were talking about 4E and dissociated mechanics, there were arguments pointing out that dissociated mechanics had long existed in the game. This lead me to conclude it was largely about volume and how easy it was to ignore.<br/><br/>But to answer your question, the things that impinge on my play are anything that reminds me the world isn't real and that I am playing a game. I've told this story a lot but the first time I ever played an RPG was I believe a version of Mech Warrior that the GM had tweaked to his taste. The biggest thing that struck me once I started playing was I felt transported completely to another place. It was way more powerful than a movie or book and really had an impact on me. So I think when I play, this is the experience I am chasing. I've realized though not everyone is chasing that. And when you have someone else in control of the game who is chasing something else, that can affect my enjoyment. <br/><br/>To be clear here, I am not a jerk about it. If one of my players is really excited about a game that is built more around making decisions out of character and telling a story or something, I am not going to crap on him and tell him I hate that stuff. I'll try it and see what it is about it he likes so much. I'll probably have fun. I just won't be getting the experience I'm typically there for. This is more about knowing what clicks for me and what kinds of games I want to make. It isn't about saying this game or that game shouldn't exist (or that this style of play is inferior). <br/><br/>Also it is worth pointing out, few groups are made of a homogenous crowd. My current group has a range of players who come to the table for different reasons and with different preferences. Since I am the GM the sessions always reflect my desire for immersion to an extent, but I am not inflexible and I will adjust to suit the players I have at my table (because an immersion heavy game that doesn't worry at all about story would bore some players to tears...if those folks are present and it isn't disruptive to the rest of the group, I'll include things I know they'll like). Obviously there are cases where someone is just in a group that doesn't fit them though. <br/><br/>I hope that answers your question. If not I am happy to clarify. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449845/#Comment_449845" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-01T18:54:24+00:00" title="December  1, 2015  6:54PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I don't have anything specific to add right now, but I really enjoyed that last post of yours Brendan - nice to see someone really thinking through their gaming preferences, and being able to articulate that without dragging other people's preferences through the mud - and a rare thing, too.

In terms of creative goals, I'd say we were perfectly aligned.<br/><br/>However, at the table we had some issues. Their approach to this kind of narration was far more bare-bones than mine, getting "to the punch" very quickly and with very little build-up. I prefer a slower pace, more vivid fictional detail, and their narration style, heavy-hitting and dramatic but very low in detail, was something I had trouble connecting to.<br/><br/>The outcome was a lot of fun in some ways, but it was a constant struggle for me to adjust to their pace, and I was constantly wishing the game would just slow down a little so I could enjoy the events which were taking place a little more.<br/><br/>It seems pretty clear to me that, while our creative goals were aligned (almost perfectly, as far as I can see), the *style* of gameplay and our expectations clashed a fair bit. It would never have caused interpersonal friction or major disagreements - the gaming was interesting and memorable - but it did limit my enjoyment of the games significantly.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449864/#Comment_449864" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T09:49:50+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  9:49AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2015 10:39AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan, thanks for your thoughts.  It's funny, I probably could have saved you some of the general explanations by saying first that I am an immersionist too.  I mean, I don't <i>always</i> seek it, and there are plenty of RPGs I like which don't support it IMO, but it remains my top favorite way to play.  So I'm plenty familiar with successful immersion and broken immersion and all sorts of player tastes along the spectrum.  <br/><br/>What I'm less familiar with is thoughtful forum discussion on immersive issues.  So I just wanted to take this opportunity to get your take, specifically on the issues you mentioned: "if the aim of a session is a good story, that produces something that has very little interest to me as a player or a GM".  And also, "once people see story as the heart of play, they start using that as a metric of good GMing."  [Both paraphrased.]  I am just curious what exactly this has looked like in your experience.<br/><br/>For my part, "story as metric for judging GMing" has never been clear and direct, but I may have experienced it indirectly in issues like pacing (if an entertaining but inconsequential scene is unfolding, I am <i>never</i> the guy to say "let's get to the point", and some folks don't love that from their GM).<br/><br/>As for a story focus producing sessions with very little interest to me, I kinda doubt it.  I mean, I've played dull sessions with players who like story in their roleplay, but I didn't see the priority being the problem so much as the techniques and rules.<br/><br/>I know that's not a very informative overview; I can elaborate if you'd like.  I'm just hoping that clarifies my interest here.<br/><br/>When you wound up not enjoying some story-aimed session, how did that happen?<br/><br/>You and I may just have different taste... or we may have the <i>exact same taste</i>*, and you'll help me remember or put into words stuff I've experienced too.  Or we may have played with different sorts of gamers and seen them take a story focus in different directions.<br/><br/>*"Anything that reminds me the world isn't real and that I am playing a game" bums me out too.  I've found that different rules/techniques achieve that "game reminder" status for different folks, though, so I can't really assume what's done that for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449865/#Comment_449865" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T09:53:14+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  9:53AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Possibly a tangent, but one I find really interesting:\n<blockquote>However some folks, and I include myself here, like genre physics and genre emulation when that is what the game calls for</blockquote>\nI'm a little surprised!  If standards for judging the GM are a significant potential source of friction, then I would think that the immersive GM who just wants to present an organic setting would feel pretty put-upon trying to "do Star Wars" or whatever.

This can look like a lot of different things depending on how invested the entire group is in the idea. I find if the players are actively trying to tell a good story together, rather than just playing their characters, that feels weird to me. It is like folks are not invested in that first person point of view at all, but rather looking at the story being created at the table and basing their choices on that (so Jon decides to strap dynamite to his chest and blow himself up to breech the wall because that is what the story, not the situation, demands; or rather than let us solve or not solve a mystery on our own puzzle solving ability, the GM or mechanics ensure that by the end of the night a good mystery story has unfolded. I can still play such a game, I am not going to cross my arms and bitch about it, but it just doesn't quite hit the same sweet spot (just like if we all go out for pizza and end up getting something at a Greek place rather than an Italian place, it's still pizza and I won't complain, but its a few degrees south of what I really want from pizza). I'm not sure if this answers your question, so happy to clarify if you need. <br/><br/>The other half of that (using it as a metric of good GMing) is a pet peeve of mine online. It is one thing to prefer that, to want your GM to help create a good story at the table. But often times in discussions about GMing it is assumed. And a lot of people have zero interest in that approach to play (just like not everyone is on the same page when it comes to stuff like challenge ratings or gun porn in RPGs). For me, I almost take the opposite approach, I prefer a GM who is willing to let things lull, to have an undramatic death, or allow for anticlimactic outcomes, in pursuit of the sense of everyone really being there. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449867/#Comment_449867" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T15:13:29+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  3:13PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Possibly a tangent, but one I find really interesting:\n<blockquote>However some folks, and I include myself here, like genre physics and genre emulation when that is what the game calls for</blockquote>\nI'm a little surprised!

My feeling is as long as its part of the physics of the settings and doesn't take you out of the character (and doesn't overwhelm play) it is fine and desirable in <i>certain </i>cases. The way I would look at it is this: the world around the players ought to be concrete, but if you imagine a game world like an alternate universe that abides by its own laws, perhaps different from out own, within that there is a lot you can do. A world where fate is real is very different from one without fate (and this could tie to genre convention in something like wuxia or western myth).<br/><br/>Everybody is going to answer this question differently, and I doubt anyone is going to be 100% consistent across the board because you are ultimately talking about how much of X becomes too much for a person to handle. But let me use something I am working on now as an example (and keep in mind I've just woken up so this may be a bit fuzzy). <br/><br/>I'm working on Wandering Heroes of Ogre Gate a wuxia setting and system. I want to emulate the genre but I also want to respect immersion. My approach has been to assume certain aspects of the genre are built into the cosmology (Fate for example). Characters and parties often have fate, this means people are often fated to meet or intersect. That can explain certain things like strangely coincidental things occurring, but it doesn't force anything beyond that. Because heroes advance in Kung Fu and physically get more powerful, there isn't explanation for why 1 guy can take out twenty schlubs (and anyone who isn't a martial expert is a schlub by design). Martial Heroes also heal faster. This is explained by the presence of Qi and internal kung fu. If I were playing a grittier game, I'd object to that. In wuxia, where this stuff is assumed to be real, it makes sense to me. Grudges are also built into things like encounter tables. Again this is a genre convention but also just reflects the fact that grudges matter a lot to people in the setting. My efforts to emulate the genre are not built around making sure a good wuxia story unfolds, but just making sure aspects of the genre crop up from time to time and are present. So the way to think of it from the player view is the world behaves consistently with the 'physics' of wuxia. That isn't about story, that is merely about genre conventions. A lot of people who like immersion won't like that, but for my table, that is how I like to do wuxia.<br/><br/>When I've been running this game (and now this is purely about GMing style, not mechanics so much), I don't worry about anything like pacing, themes, etc. I let the players try to do what they want, go where they want, and I have my NPCs behave much the same (so it is very much built around the style I mentioned earlier where the interesting stuff kind of flows from that interaction). The end result is a game where heroes wander around very sandbox like, but also has a world in motion vibe and can get vaguely dramatic at times (largely due to fate and grudges). But there is a lot of stuff like players beating challenges in two seconds because of a clever plan or getting bogged down and stuck in a dungeon for three or more sessions because they can't quite figure it out.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449868/#Comment_449868" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T15:29:53+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  3:29PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>.<br/><br/>When you wound up not enjoying some story-aimed session, how did that happen?<br/>.</blockquote>\nAgain, this stuff is not going to be 100% consistent all the time, it is more about when I happen to notice or suspect something. This is really about something being done as the sole focus all the time, than as something that crops up from time to time (which I will expand on below). <br/><br/>If the GM has an NPC do something and it seems like it's because he wants to tell a particular story or things it makes for a great story, rather than its because the NPC would do that....that pulls me out. Once or twice I won't notice, but if it is clearly the consistent factor in shaping GM calls, I can feel out of place as a player. Often times, the good story outcome and the thing the NPC would do can align, so it isn't going to be an issue every time...but you can usually tell what is driving a GM's decisions over the course of a session or campaign. Also when GMs do things that completely wipe out the outcome that ought to have occurred in order to make a good story unfold (i.e. turning a total party kill into something else) that bugs me. <br/><br/>It is like anything else in gaming, if something is an overriding goal and the approach is uncompromising, eventually someone who is there for other things is going to get irked a bit. When you are in a group of people who are there to tell a good story, there is a feel and a way of playing the game that is just different from how I usually do things. That doesn't make it bad. It is not different than if you have a bunch of players who are really into tactics or optimization and they play accordingly. That is just their style, how their group developed over time and completely their business how they do things. <br/><br/>This can swing the other way as well. I don't run uncompromisingly immersive games because my group is made up of a wide range of players. I know if I ran the sessions in most groups 100% to my own player style, I'd have one or two players bored from time to time, so I mix it up and throw in things I know they will like. <br/><br/>I think techniques are more likely to create issues because the aims can often go unnoticed or play toward several styles. So techniques where things are presented as scenes (or where pacing is controlled and edited in that way) really confuse me as a player and as a GM. My group tried to run Ecoterrorists as written, including laws approach to scenes and ending scenes, and it was jarring for all involved. Partly this was because I don't normally do that and it was difficult for me to employ smoothly but also because it just didn't work with out style (I had one player basically say 'great game' but he had no interest in me ever attempting that stuff again). <br/><br/>Most groups are not so simple as sharing one goal. I think the more a GM and game group allow for different goals, the less trouble you'll actually encounter on this front (yes it may annoy me a tad that this or that keeps cropping up, but as long as I am getting to chase my bug at the table from time to time, it kind of washes out). Increasingly my approach to play has been to acknowledge this. <br/><br/>There is that famous Ted Talk about tomato sauce that a lot of gamers have pointed to (where the speaker points out some people like chunky, some like thin and some like spicy...or something to that effect). What he overlooks, and what people making the comparison overlook, is that gaming and tomato sauce are not usually single serve: they are both traditionally made for a large group of people who are going to have different tastes. So while you can get away with making a chunky sauce if everyone at the table likes chunky, chances are you have a mix and have to compromise to satisfy everyone (and that takes a lot of skill because it is much harder to do). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449871/#Comment_449871" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T16:38:54+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  4:38PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting discussion continues here, I am glad to discover.<br/><br/>I have a few brief thoughts on this topic, as I have a few moments to squander before I get back to work:<br/><br/>* I think that the idea of "immersive" roleplay conflates a lot of different things, like the techniques being discussed as well as conventions of play (for instance, I remember at one point finding "cutting from scene to scene" to be really jarring, even though, in practice, it happens in all games, and it's really just a question of whether you use a couple of sentences to transition from one scene to the next, covering the intervening time).<br/><br/>* Brendan's description of GMs ruining the game due to a "story focus" sounds to me like the problem isn't in the aims OR the techniques, but just sloppy storytelling. Every good writer (or even an audience member at a movie) knows that stories don't "feel" right if the characters don't follow consistent motivations. So, from my perspective, having a character suddenly act against their own established motivations isn't "playing for story", it's ruining the existing flow of the fiction by breaking our expectations for a certain character. Acting against what we've established without justification is going to rather rough going for anyone, immersive or not. (I can imagine another "immersionist" GM instituting a "motivations" random table and rolling on it from time to time, producing exactly the same botched results if they don't manage to justify the events in some convincing way.)<br/><br/>* I agree with Brendan that there is a distinction between "immersion" in a physics-realistic universe, where things follow causal logic, and another sort of "immersion" in a genre-based universe, where things follow a different sort of causal logic. (One can imagine playing a character in an epic, a wuxia-style story, a Call of Cthulhu-esque psycho-mystery, or an action movie, even though all of these violate "real-world" causality in various ways.) In this view, I'd venture to guess that "immersion" for a player comes from being able to inhabit a character and make decisions from that character's perspective without having to worry about contradictory inputs. For instance, if you're playing Aragorn in a Lord of the Rings-type game - much like in the wuxia example being used - you wouldn't expect to be scared of three Orcs on a battlefield. If the game rules make that into a routinely life-threatening circumstance, that implication, however realistic, is going to "pull you out of character" - Aragorn isn't afraid at all, but you, as the player, are.<br/><br/>* Another interesting distinction in technique is how a GM runs an "immersive" game. Dave, from what I know of your gaming style, you're very accepting of the GM's needs to generate drama and exciting events in order to keep the game from stagnating (or so it seems; you're always looking for tools to do that, in discussions we've had about this). Brendan, I don't know much about you, but I get the sense that you, as a GM, seek to portray the "world" and its characters, and you're fine with that producing boring or anti-climactic outcomes. (I fall closer to that end of the spectrum if I'm gaming in this style: I'd want to act as much as possible as a pure "referee", adjudicating outcomes and presenting causal effects to the players, whose decisions drive gameplay. I don't want to be distracted with "metagame concerns" like whether the pacing of the session is running on-schedule and whether enough is happening for Bill, who is easily bored.<br/><br/>* The points about tomato sauce and how all of this must ultimately be tempered by real-world concerns and your particular group's constituency are excellent, however! These platonic ideals are unlikely to ever come to our table in real life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449874/#Comment_449874" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T17:24:46+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  5:24PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2015 5:31PM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bedrockbrendan, I might be mistaken, but some things about your posts make me think that part of it isn't exactly a problem of "trying to play for the best story" but about "forcing story" into the game; I mean, sounds a bit like you and your group have been victims of an abuse of GM fiat and players metagaming, that perhaps hasn't gone beyond tolerable, but is enough to make you feel that playing with story as a goal means going against the logic of the setting and the character's natures.<br/><br/>Perhaps this comes to me as that because as a writer myself, breaking the logic of the setting and going against a character's personality because of "Drama!" is terrible story-writing.

I've just had enough experience playing and running games over the years that I've learned what works for me and what I want. If anything, my issue with railroading storylines is a separate and something that I experienced more as a GM than player (that is having grown up on the 90s GM advice, telling the players a good story was something I used to try to do, but I found that incredibly unsatisfying after a while and realized I could just hand them my notes rather than run the game. From the GM side what excites me is not knowing where things will go or how they will turn out. I also love world building and creating NPCs and groups. So my focus on the prep side focuses on that, while my focus on the running side focuses on allowing things to unfold as organically as possible. From the player side, I enjoy the freedom being a character affords and I like the excitement of an even handed game where the dice can mean death even when that wouldn't be advised in a story. <br/><br/>I don't know. What i can say is if you can focus on story and it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment, it isn't going to be a problem. So if nothing you are doing is detracting me from my sense of immersion and been the character, there isn't really an issue. This is why I said before that having concrete rules or principles can sometimes get in the way if there isn't even an issue to begin with. That said, I would point back to my initial statement about the flexibility of the word story. If you just take it to mean "fun stuff that happens in the game" then there is no issue there. But if focus on story means something more specific, there may be style differences at the table that would impinge on my enjoyment. My basic point is this, when I measure the "success" of a session or of a system, it isn't based on the shape or quality of the story that emerged, rather it is based on whether I had fun playing my character. Some people legitimately want there to be a story they can look back on and appreciate as a story. If that is your goal, that is probably going to lead you down different roads than I would go (mechanically and in terms of GM style). I've definitely at least been involved in conversations where people try to get me to change my play style by turning on a particular meaning of the word story. That is the sort of thing that tends to aggravate me because I want to play the game the way I play it, and conceptualize it in a way that works for me (ultimately all this talk of story, setting, etc is just metaphor anyways for helping us understand what we are doing). If 'story' as a metaphor works for you, that is fine. For me it isn't a terribly helpful metaphor any longer because it has only ever produced confusion or (in extreme cases) things like railroading and systems I just don't have a lot of interest in. <br/><br/>I realize that a good storyteller or writer isn't going to have characters do things outside of their personality to drive the story forward, but a writer still has to heed the story. There are stories that are more character driven for sure (and personally I tend to gravitate toward those as a reader). But they are still stories; the characters still have arcs and half the point is finding out how those unfold. You can't just have the characters hang out at a news stand for an entire novel because that is what they want to do or find interesting for a day. You do have to create a story in some way. In a game you don't have to do that really. I've seen whole sessions spent on talking at a tavern or planning for a big siege or whatever. These are things that can also be dramatized in story but they flow so much differently in an organic RPG session. To me the role of a GM is very different from the role of a writer or director.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449876/#Comment_449876" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T18:19:59+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  6:19PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2015 6:24PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>* I think that the idea of "immersive" roleplay conflates a lot of different things, like the techniques being discussed as well as conventions of play (for instance, I remember at one point finding "cutting from scene to scene" to be really jarring, even though, in practice, it happens in all games, and it's really just a question of whether you use a couple of sentences to transition from one scene to the next, covering the intervening time).</blockquote>\nThis is a point where I think people often misunderstand one another's desires. I think scene cutting is a huge issue for immersive players. This is something you see a lot of people complain about. What you are describing here, when the GM accelerates time or something and it isn't an issue, I think that is because it is really the GM reading the players correctly and understanding they are ready to elapse. It isn't about framing a scene, it is about moving on when you know people are just going to be walking from point A to point B and don't want to simulate an eight hour journey in real time. That is very different from scene framing and similar techniques. <br/><br/>When people say they don't like "scenes" or "scene framing" I'd be careful about looking for ways they may secretly not mind it (in the same way that people who complain about martial powers in 4E, may have tolerated some amount of it in prior editions). This is often a question of volume, noticeability and the intent. When I consciously tried to deal in scenes to run Essoterrorists, it produced a much different experience for me and my players than when we simply accelerated time to get passed something we already knew the outcome of. \n<blockquote><br/>* Brendan's description of GMs ruining the game due to a "story focus" sounds to me like the problem isn't in the aims OR the techniques, but just sloppy storytelling.

Acting against what we've established without justification is going to rather rough going for anyone, immersive or not. )</blockquote>\nI think if the end result of the GMing trying to tell a story is indistinguishable from the GM trying to immerse the characters in a realistic setting, then the goal is almost besides the point. There really isn't a disagreement at that point, except people are just debating how to talk about running or playing a game. But I find in practice that it matters and can produce conflict. It might not be an issue in cases here (I don't know since I haven't played with anyone here). But I've definitely seen it come up. <br/><br/>Keep in mind, this doesn't just have to do with character motivations, it has to do with other types of outcomes and other decisions the GM makes about what happens when. For example a lot of people object to characters being killed by stray arrows from orcs on the grounds that it is bad for story, and you see GMs fudge on those grounds (or make choices about who gets hit on those grounds). A main character getting killed by an orc arrow before he even gets to the dungeon isn't something a lot of players accept for that reason. Personally I think that is a case where letting the dice fall where they may is better (at least for my enjoyment). Similarly you see this with things like defeating a major NPC. In a movie or book, you have a certain expectation of how difficult villains will be to overcome and how much of a challenge they ought to present. In a game where story matters a lot, I'd expect the GM to do things within his power (not necessarily railroad but possibly setting things up before hand so they are more likely to play out a certain way) to ensure villains get the right amount of spotlight. I don't want any of that when I GM. If the players figure stuff out quickly and quietly poison my big villain before he even makes an entrance, that is totally cool. This leads to a lot of things in play that takes time for players who are really into story to adjust to. In terms of flow, in terms of the rise and fall of different obstacles, just generally in terms of expectations, it is something where I've noted some players get puzzled that I am not playing to story. This may not be what you have in mind when you think of story as focus of course (since the term varies so widely in use) but in my experience it is a real world example of how that expectation can lead to confusion at my own table. <br/><br/>And here the issue really isn't the word story. It is a perfectly okay word to use. But I've found some players, come to the game with the expectations that their characters are like stars in a movie and that each session or adventure ought to feel like a story (some even want something approaching a three act structure or at the very least a sense of climax at the end, with some resolution). These preferences are fine if that is what someone wants, I've just found when they carry that particular preference into my table it can produce confusion at first because I'm just not giving them any of that. I do realize story can mean many other things, but it is much easier for me to avoid the word and focus on ways to convey what my GM style and preferences really amount to in terms that properly set expectations. \n<blockquote> I agree with Brendan that there is a distinction between "immersion" in a physics-realistic universe, where things follow causal logic, and another sort of "immersion" in a genre-based universe, where things follow a different sort of causal logic.

But I am also keenly aware of peoples' moods at the table (I am not the best GM in the world, probably mediocre, but one strength I feel I have is an ability to gauge what the players are thinking and feeling based on non-verbal cues). If I feel someone is losing interest, at that point I am not worried about "purity of my style", I am there to make sure people have a good time. So I'm not going to force a purely immersive experience on people who don't want it. I will be flexible. But at the end of the day, I'm still the one GMing and the game will just naturally reflect my preferences, so the overall gravity of the style is immersive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449879/#Comment_449879" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T01:47:08+00:00" title="December  4, 2015  1:47AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I prefer a GM who is willing to let things lull, to have an undramatic death, or allow for anticlimactic outcomes, in pursuit of the sense of everyone really being there.</blockquote>Yeah.

I've just had enough experience playing and running games over the years that I've learned what works for me and what I want. If anything, my issue with railroading storylines is a separate and something that I experienced more as a GM than player (that is having grown up on the 90s GM advice, telling the players a good story was something I used to try to do, but I found that incredibly unsatisfying after a while and realized I could just hand them my notes rather than run the game.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's why I tried phrasing it in my post as not only a GM issue, but also a player's issue. It has been discussed somewhere in the forum before, that players can also "railroad" in some way. <br/><br/>I'd like to clarify that in my case, I've seen it as a "dynamic problem" if such thing can be said: sometimes the problem comes from the GM, some from the players, sometimes from both and that's exchangeable at anytime. <br/><br/>It most often starts with good intentions that take a wrong turn later. The GM get's inspired and prepares a lot of interesting material, trying later to railroad the players through all of it using different techniques, tricks, constrains, limiting the information available and such. On the player's side they propose and insist on taking new options, do anything to ignore, destroy or cancel anything that resembles a plot hook, go out of character, etc to avoid the railroading; they hunt for loopholes in the rules and use mechanic and narrative optimization to get out of the challenges presented by the GM or even before she gets to present it.<br/><br/>It's usually a cold war as neither side exposes or recognizes a problem, or may even think that's the way the game is supposed to be or otherwise "It wouldn't be fun". <br/><br/>I'd say that 60% of the issues I had with GM or player railroading could have been prevented with some pre-game talk about the nature of the logic that would be used, what everyone considers the fun of the game is, how is meant to be played and GMed. <br/>20% was poor timing and/or poorly reading the atmosphere, the GM's or player's intention/state.<br/>The other 10% was just personal issues produced by some frustrating game situations and some other things that were the before the game, but didn't surfaced until then.<br/><br/>My take is that "story" can be, as any other thing in the game, perfectly used as any cheap excuse for both GM and player railroading. Is removing "story" out of the equation the solution? Well, at least removing the wrong definition of the term definitely is, but it has to include anything related to not previously discussed "Railroading" techniques. What it's always wrong here is forcing things onto the GM or the players. <br/><br/>We can perfectly agree that the game will be lethal and random shots may outright kill PCs in an anti-climatic fashion . That creates another atmosphere and a different kind of story. One that is not character driven of course, but not a poor one because of that. Real life History isn't less interesting because heroes were normal people. In fact, it's because they were normal people that what they did becomes more impressive. Going after that feeling isn't "not going after story" as you can note.\n<blockquote><br/>From the GM side what excites me is not knowing where things will go or how they will turn out. I also love world building and creating NPCs and groups. So my focus on the prep side focuses on that, while my focus on the running side focuses on allowing things to unfold as organically as possible. From the player side, I enjoy the freedom being a character affords and I like the excitement of an even handed game where the dice can mean death even when that wouldn't be advised in a story. <br/><br/>I don't know. What i can say is if you can focus on story and it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment, it isn't going to be a problem. So if nothing you are doing is detracting me from my sense of immersion and been the character, there isn't really an issue. This is why I said before that having concrete rules or principles can sometimes get in the way if there isn't even an issue to begin with. That said, I would point back to my initial statement about the flexibility of the word story. If you just take it to mean "fun stuff that happens in the game" then there is no issue there. But if focus on story means something more specific, there may be style differences at the table that would impinge on my enjoyment. My basic point is this, when I measure the "success" of a session or of a system, it isn't based on the shape or quality of the story that emerged, rather it is based on whether I had fun playing my character. Some people legitimately want there to be a story they can look back on and appreciate as a story. If that is your goal, that is probably going to lead you down different roads than I would go (mechanically and in terms of GM style). I've definitely at least been involved in conversations where people try to get me to change my play style by turning on a particular meaning of the word story. That is the sort of thing that tends to aggravate me because I want to play the game the way I play it, and conceptualize it in a way that works for me (ultimately all this talk of story, setting, etc is just metaphor anyways for helping us understand what we are doing). If 'story' as a metaphor works for you, that is fine. For me it isn't a terribly helpful metaphor any longer because it has only ever produced confusion or (in extreme cases) things like railroading and systems I just don't have a lot of interest in. <br/><br/>I realize that a good storyteller or writer isn't going to have characters do things outside of their personality to drive the story forward, but a writer still has to heed the story. There are stories that are more character driven for sure (and personally I tend to gravitate toward those as a reader). But they are still stories; the characters still have arcs and half the point is finding out how those unfold. You can't just have the characters hang out at a news stand for an entire novel because that is what they want to do or find interesting for a day. You do have to create a story in some way. In a game you don't have to do that really. I've seen whole sessions spent on talking at a tavern or planning for a big siege or whatever. These are things that can also be dramatized in story but they flow so much differently in an organic RPG session. To me the role of a GM is very different from the role of a writer or director.</blockquote>\nThis the best approach for me right now too. I don't like to make stuff in advance and lately that extends to settings, places and major NPCs. I create the setting along with the players on the first session, just in general terms and starting small. I write down whatever they would like to include and prep a bit from that. I let the dice, players and situations determine which NPC will become important and start giving them memorable traits when they survive a hit, an encounter or any other kind of interaction with the players.<br/><br/>Then what kind of "story" goal I'm focusing on? Mostly an after the facts one; I don't write too many "cool scenes that will happen" except if its something the players can't prevent, and even then I don't use it unless the players run out of things to do or aren't sure about their next objective.

Again, if conceptualizing the game as story creation works for you, then I would say that is how you ought to talk about play and design. My experience has been thinking in terms of the story gets in the way of what I am really after, and can lead to confusion. It is great as an initial metaphor for what an RPG is (i.e. an RPG is like being in a story) but where disagreement tends to arise for me is when the metaphor becomes the focus. Now if it works for you, that is totally fine. I might say story exists in what goes on at the table, but it isn't the point for me. \n<blockquote>We can perfectly agree that the game will be lethal and random shots may outright kill PCs in an anti-climatic fashion .

Its just that no one is guaranteed a sustained role. History is a good example, and probably closer to how I think in terms of campaigns. Now you could describe that as story, and many newer novels like Game of Thrones, try to emulate the flow of history to create a less predictable and more natural feeling storyline....but I've never really thought of history as a story. To me, history is the opposite of a story because it's real and it can be told a bunch of different ways. It also lacks the engineered drama of story. History is filled with real world drama, but there is no predicting how it will play out. There are no literary patterns behind the movement of history. People die randomly of bacterial infections, often just as their 'story' is getting started. History is the stuff that happened (or rather the study of the stuff that happened), not the telling of the tale of those things (though historians will construct a narrative* based on their analysis of the past, that isn't the sole aim of history). My major in college was history, so it makes sense to me that this is how I might see a campaign world unfolding more than a novel or film. With a campaign the focus for me is the micro scale of course. <br/>\n<blockquote>This the best approach for me right now too.

If so I am not critiquing your approach, just clarifying my own. In terms of preparation of the setting, I don't really involve the players in that. I do feel, at least for how I like to run things, that it is important to keep those things separate in order to make the world feel real and external. I will incorporate some amount of backstory and what the players choose to focus on with their character may lead me to think about aspects of the setting that I wouldn't otherwise, but I do veto and I don't embrace the "just say yes" approach (as a player I was never a fan of that). <br/><br/>I do prep a lot of NPCs, locations, etc. Many of them don't come into play. As the campaign unfolds I have a better sense of where my efforts ought to be focused. Sometimes I have to ad lib based on what I've already established if they go somewhere I simply wasn't expecting them to. <br/><br/>*This has come to mean something very specific in politics and literature but its use in history is a little less loaded (just a chronological retelling of the events)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449897/#Comment_449897" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T19:59:47+00:00" title="December  4, 2015  7:59PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>What about character development?

We started this thread as a discussion about "the role of story in RPGs", but digging a little deeper seems to expose, rather, unhappiness with specific play techniques - and, more specifically, disagreement about expectations.<br/><br/>It seems to me that proper communication about the creative goals of a game and getting everyone on the same page is the best (and perhaps only) way to solve such issues (along with sensible design which supports those goals).<br/><br/>For instance, if the players think that this game is all about celebrating their awesome heroes and seeing them undergo dramatic adventures, but the GM wants to use a set of deadly rules, throw challenges at the players, and let the dice lie where the fall in order to see how well they fare, it's not a huge surprise that people are going to be unhappy (to use one example that came up in this thread).<br/><br/>I don't see anything having to do with "story" and, rather, everything to do with having proper expectations about the nature of the game, its creative goals, and how we're going to achieve them together.<br/><br/>An example of an attempt to make this easier to navigate is Chris Chinn's "<a href="https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-same-page-tool/" rel="nofollow">Same Page Tool</a>", on which he comments:<br/><br/>"Anyway, as useful as The Same Page Tool is, it stands as sort of a testament to the massive failure in our hobby to understand, describe, and communicate core processes of gameplay."<br/><br/>Sounds about right to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449902/#Comment_449902" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T22:25:29+00:00" title="December  4, 2015 10:25PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/744#top" rel="nofollow">This here</a> is also a good list of various ways a player and a character's goals can interact in an RPG.

I am just curious at the ground level how things play out in your game compared to my own and I am not 100% certain I follow the details here. </blockquote>\nIt's basically an idea I took from PbtA games as in "whenever you roll, whatever you roll, something interesting happens". I extended it to the choices player take because, analyzing most of the cases where players take poor choices it isn't because they misread the scenario. The whole thing is happening in our heads but that doesn't mean we're all imagining things in exactly the same way. What usually happens is that they missed a crucial piece of information or interpreted in a different way, or even that the GM worded it incorrectly. Whenever this gets mixed with a highly lethal game, some sort of hilarity appears, the "stupid death" effect -which while valid (if agreed from the beginning, that is), it isn't a kind of fun I'm after.<br/><br/>So my take is to narrate how the choices they took become relevant. Sometimes is enough not making fun about which one they took or maybe bringing up something good about it even when I didn't prep for it. I also extended this to poor rolls: It isn't that PCs just "miss", it's the perfect chance to make the opponents shine and do something unexpected, or perhaps just get really lucky. It can even meant their gods are acting upon and suddenly the fight gets another depth as a couple of rolls and some "after the facts" narration reveals the gods themselves are fighting here through their faithful believers.<br/><br/>There are also social reasons I'm taking this approach. If I, as a player, take a choice that I think is the optimal for the situation given the information I've got about it, and then it turns out it isn't, I get that my character has to pay the consequences. But, if that means the GM will narrate my character as purposely doing something stupid, while somewhat comical, that destroys all the effort I put into the characterization and feels as making fun out of me, as if I was guilty of making that poor option!<br/><br/>It's the same with poor rolls. Poor luck isn't nobody's fault, so as a GM do I have to let it ruin the story or let it become an anti-climatic moment? Well, I certainly can't ignore a fumble, but why narrate it as a colossal failure of a 5th level warrior and ruin an epic story for the laughs? Instead, I make the kobold not only dodge the attack with an incredible move, but give it something that makes it different from other kobolds, even if that lasts only until the next turn. If the scene was fitting, I can even add some bonuses to that kobold (like a +1 to attack and damage or rise it's AC the same amount) as if the NPC leveled up at that moment. <br/><br/>I'm often amazed at how this surprises most players, as they are used from other groups to become the joke of the night because of a fumble. Also, players remember better those opponents that gave them trouble, so turning these into important NPC is far easier and feels more natural than introducing a particular NPC first and then railroad the game into making that NPC do something important/memorable.<br/><br/>It's about the same situation with NPCs that are introduced to help the party. Out of fun, frustration or misunderstanding, players often go aggressive on them first instead of asking nicely. Sometimes, even pointing that they are going out of character won't work because of reasons. So, why not make that NPC into a lowlife villain by narrating how players end up noticing clues to confirm their suspicions?<br/><br/>Well I don't do anything on this post as often as you may think but it's refreshing when I do. Works because I impro most of the generic stuff and then do prep properly only when consequences arise. Thus, I end up prepping less (except for all the random tables and procedures I use to improv things properly) before a game/campaign and relying on players to create the base of it.<br/><br/>About this particular, it isn't as if I don't veto things or just say yes. Happens that I can turn things that players say out of fun into quite serious interesting stuff. It often blows their minds for the sudden change in approach so most of the ideas they shoot after that become more focused and interesting. That way, I often end up vetoing less stuff and spending less time discussing the setting with the players.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449924/#Comment_449924" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-07T16:15:23+00:00" title="December  7, 2015  4:15PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on the spot Paul, I often play to find out what the player's objectives are, though it's quite hard sometimes to infer from their actions or words. Too much metagaming in there and it can even change from one session to another, or even in the same session if something rubs them wrong. I discarded alignment rules at first but all this made me keen to put it back, it's simpler to handle a more stable characterization that way.<br/><br/>Also, another big deal of why I don't prep much "story" (basically background) before the first session of a campaign starts is because giving information to the players in big chunks often has the "too long, didn't read" effect, they get either frustrated for the game to start, things to start moving, misheard or forget important details and probably even miss the atmosphere the GM is trying to convey. On the best case, they'll probably don't like too much one thing or two and won't have a saying on it, so that may ruin a bit of their experience. And even if they like it, it's not as if they are investing on this, so it's harder to make the players love or even take interest in something in the setting. And without that attachment, the amount and variety of plot hooks you can dispose of decreases significantly unless you specifically ask the players to make up bonds for their characters.<br/><br/>So, what happens when players get to create the setting?<br/>-They get a better idea of the atmosphere of the setting<br/>-They invest on it, even get attached to whatever they created<br/>-They now know as much of general culture as any NPC in the setting. They will totally be in the same page as the GM.<br/>-The GM can still surprise them. When the players have finished the setting I often warn them that whatever they created is the general knowledge and opinion of most people in the setting, but not necessarily the whole truth. <br/>-You can often ask players for further detail about whatever they created and yet veto or modify it. Less work for you and the more brains adding details, the more rich the whole setting becomes.<br/>-Giving players the chance to create more things has a secondary social effect. They end up paying more attention to the world and whatever happens on it, since part of it is their (intelectual) property and they can't help but to care about it. Even if they made something to be destroyed, they care about how and who is going to destroy it.<br/>-I have them roll dice at setting creation sometimes to define how good or bad is something they have created, since just vetoing something that might be overpowered can feel frustrating at times. This also produces interesting twists on the setting background so I'm often amazed at how things are from the start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449968/#Comment_449968" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-13T08:55:39+00:00" title="December 13, 2015  8:55AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2015 10:16AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>, sorry to ask a bunch of questions and then disappear for 10 days.  Busy stretch of freelancing.<br/><br/>Having read all your examples of things that mess with your immersive fun, I think they all fall into one category: transparent contrivance*.  That moment where you can see that something that just happened in the fiction happened for some reason other than fictional causality.<br/><br/>Examples of such techniques include:<br/>- the player or GM has their PC or NPC do something that that character wouldn't do<br/>- violations of established physics<br/>- rejecting dice outcomes despite a prior agreement that dice mechanics model and represent fictional causality<br/>- the undo: "no, wait, let's have that not happen"<br/>- the railroad -- "all your other options suddenly disappear; please go <i>this</i> way"<br/><br/>Examples of reasons for employing these techniques include:<br/>- GM or player wants things to go a certain way because it'd be cool (as per their aesthetics)<br/>- GM or player doesn't want play to go in the direction hitherto indicated (e.g. character death)<br/>- GM or player is trying to do "what would make a good story"<br/>- GM wants things to go a certain way because it's their plan<br/>- GM feels it's their job to exert authorial vision over the proceedings<br/><br/>Does that sound about right?<br/><br/>If so, then I would agree that a GM's or group's focus on "making a good story" over and above immersion would indeed make such breaches more likely.  <br/><br/>It still strikes me as very possible to pursue good stories without violating internal causality, but the "pursue story" part needs to be done more in the set-up phase and in between play, as opposed to during play.  And then during play, immersion must be prioritized.  Does that combo sound plausible to you?<br/><br/>One uncertainty I have about the above: when you mentioned scene framing, I simultaneously thought "Why would that be an issue?" and "Oh yeah, I don't do much of that when I GM immersive games."  My first thought is that there are two potential problems, both easily solvable:<br/>1) Framing a new scene with elements that are obviously present just because it would be convenient for them to be present, rather than because in-fiction logic implies them.  Solution: don't do that, GM.<br/>2) Dislocation.  Loss of character identification when we cut forward in time to a new place and situation, and I don't know how my character got from the last place and situation to this one.  Solution: once you start playing, any leap forward in time must be summarized so every player can fill in the blanks in their character's experience.<br/><br/>Am I missing anything?<br/><br/>* Unless the simple knowledge of a GM's priorities can ruin your fun even if those priorities never actually manifest in a breach of in-fiction causality.  I'm guessing that's not the case; if it is, can you explain?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449969/#Comment_449969" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-13T08:57:37+00:00" title="December 13, 2015  8:57AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2015 10:38AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had written a ton of other stuff about whether emulating genre physics but not genre stories counts as effective genre emulation; whether a bit of aimlessness in immersive play is good, bad, or neutral; and how much unity vs politely-appreciated division is good for a group.  <br/><br/>I think that stuff might derail the discussion, though, so I've deleted it for now.

Editing a project now so my replies may not be as well thought out as I'd like here. \n<blockquote>Having read all your examples of things that mess with your immersive fun, I think they all fall into one category: transparent contrivance*.

I don't mind a good story emerging during play. It is just that I don't want that to necessarily be the reason something happens. I would liken my preferences these days more toward maintaining a long term campaign, where the fuel is really the fact that I'm not thinking in terms of things like stories, arcs, etc. If I had to boil my approach down to a fundamental philosophy, it  is more that it doesn't even address this issue at all. It is all about: what just happened, and what's happening now. Focusing on the present moment and building off the past. This is why I pointed toward history as the metaphor I am more comfortable with. <br/>\n<blockquote>If so, then I would agree that a GM's or group's focus on "making a good story" over and above immersion would indeed make such breaches more likely. </blockquote>\nI can't speak for other groups.

You can set up a lot of pieces before hand that will lead to a good story I suppose, but once things are set in motion....I just don't think I find it sustainable if I'm thinking in terms of maintaining a good story. I'd much rather just focus on "This happened, now we're here and this is about to happen". \n<blockquote>One uncertainty I have about the above: when you mentioned scene framing, I simultaneously thought "Why would that be an issue?" and "Oh yeah, I don't do much of that when I GM immersive games."

I don't frame the scene, I just try to organically manage the flow of time so that it feels like the players are really getting from point A to B without me causing a bunch of stuff to happen in between that they have no control over. This was one of the things that really confused me the first time I read essoterorists (because it deals heavily with scenes as a concept and I just don't prepare adventures that way). Anytime I've encountered talk of scenes in GMing advice or whatnot, it seems a little artificial for my tastes (same with montages and flashbacks...it just doesn't work for how I run and like to play games). The closest I've probably come to that sort of mechanic was allowing characters to shift over multiple characters involved in counter terrorism operations in Terror Network (so for example you can start out as the guy on the ground finding evidence, then your the guy on the mission to take out an agent in the middle east or something). After about six months of that, I decided it wasn't worth it (even though it did get around the issue of how do you plausibly involve in the players over the course of a whole investigation when they are often this vast interplay between several departments). I think it was something that looked good on a page, kind of made the game stand out, but in actual play just didn't work for most people at the table (myself included). For me this definitely reinforced the idea that one of the key things about immersion is experiencing the world from the perspective of a single character. I think this is why in an RPG like D&amp;D when you have henchmen or followers, if you allow the players to run them (which sometimes is just a matter of necessity because the GM is so busy) it kind of diminishes the overall experience for me and feels a bit cheap (like someone suddenly turned the lights up in the room when your watching a film in the dark). <br/><br/>Really for me it is about GMing and playing in a way that is naturalistic and organic.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449977/#Comment_449977" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T05:08:57+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  5:08AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, it's that! I had my doubts but it seems that most of the time a big part of the disagreement and need for further information and suggestions was based on the issue of having different definitions, and limits for several related terms.<br/><br/>I mean, your definition of 'scene framing' includes time compression as a must, while mine doesn't, or at least not as something always used in scene framing. For me, narrating "a clear in the forest appears ahead"  after another scene where the PCs have been walking through the forest is 'scene framing'. No time has been compressed here, one thing follows the other in a natural way and basically for me it's 'scene framing' just because the surroundings have clearly changed. <br/><br/>PCs are no longer walking through the forest and given this change I have to give them the chance to change their course of action before they enter the clear. They will definitely ask more information about what is ahead so I'll keep adding things to the description, as it's a totally new scene that I have to paint in the player's minds.<br/><br/>About time compression, there are good reasons to do it and good ways to do it so immersion doesn't suffer, tough I agree that while often tolerable (specially if done right) it's a disruption nonetheless. Most usual bad reasons for time compression: the GM is bored, can't deal with whatever the players want to do because of lack of prep or worse, because that would wreck the prep he's done and fallen in love with. Good reasons for time compression would be: the players are more interested in the outcome of an action or series of actions than in whatever could happen in between; or the players are frustrated because nothing interesting will happen until some event is due and they are out of ideas on how to pass the time until then.<br/><br/>Bad ways of using time compression include all forcing one or more of the players to stop whatever they are doing and most possibly deny them control of their characters until the event happens by plainly jumping in time/space and narrating how they got there, in past time. A more democratic way is to ask players <i>if</i> they want to jump time/space before doing so, and on top of that, ask them if they want to do something before, on the way or as they arrive to the next scene. Probably they will come up quickly with something that would make the time compression unnecessary as these kind of questions are a good cue that you ougtha think fast. That little bit of stress often makes wonders on player creativity.<br/><br/>For me, montages are just cheap storytelling popularized in 80's movies. Never used one in a RPG, tough a buddy of mine narrated one to get that 80's b-movie atmosphere going, complete with soundtrack. He's kinda hipster, we got the joke and laugh with him.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are specially tricky. I never just narrate them taking away player's agency nor forcing them too much to railroad themselves into their future self. Actually, I wouldn't had done that at all if it wasn't because there weren't enough players for the normal campaign and instead of cancelling it I choosed to improvise something that happened in their past, when their characters meet for the first time, for example.<br/><br/>What I did was frame the scene as usual, use some player's help to give good reasons to the PCs to be there and play from there. Would that meant that there wasn't any chance of character death? Well, actually I didn't worry and agreed with the players that this session could be a "what if". If something interesting came from it, good, I'd include it on the campaign. If one died but the consequences could be turned into something interesting, well there's always resurrection magic or other excuses that could be used. If it turned into a TPK then it was just a "what if" and that's it.

I had my doubts but it seems that most of the time a big part of the disagreement and need for further information and suggestions was based on the issue of having different definitions, and limits for several related terms.<br/><br/>I mean, your definition of 'scene framing' includes time compression as a must, while mine doesn't, or at least not as something always used in scene framing. For me, narrating "a clear in the forest appears ahead"  after another scene where the PCs have been walking through the forest is 'scene framing'. No time has been compressed here, one thing follows the other in a natural way and basically for me it's 'scene framing' just because the surroundings have clearly changed. <br/><br/>PCs are no longer walking through the forest and given this change I have to give them the chance to change their course of action before they enter the clear. They will definitely ask more information about what is ahead so I'll keep adding things to the description, as it's a totally new scene that I have to paint in the player's minds.<br/><br/>About time compression, there are good reasons to do it and good ways to do it so immersion doesn't suffer, tough I agree that while often tolerable (specially if done right) it's a disruption nonetheless. Most usual bad reasons for time compression: the GM is bored, can't deal with whatever the players want to do because of lack of prep or worse, because that would wreck the prep he's done and fallen in love with. Good reasons for time compression would be: the players are more interested in the outcome of an action or series of actions than in whatever could happen in between; or the players are frustrated because nothing interesting will happen until some event is due and they are out of ideas on how to pass the time until then.<br/><br/>Bad ways of using time compression include all forcing one or more of the players to stop whatever they are doing and most possibly deny them control of their characters until the event happens by plainly jumping in time/space and narrating how they got there, in past time. A more democratic way is to ask players <i>if</i> they want to jump time/space before doing so, and on top of that, ask them if they want to do something before, on the way or as they arrive to the next scene. Probably they will come up quickly with something that would make the time compression unnecessary as these kind of questions are a good cue that you ougtha think fast. That little bit of stress often makes wonders on player creativity.<br/><br/>For me, montages are just cheap storytelling popularized in 80's movies. Never used one in a RPG, tough a buddy of mine narrated one to get that 80's b-movie atmosphere going, complete with soundtrack. He's kinda hipster, we got the joke and laugh with him.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are specially tricky. I never just narrate them taking away player's agency nor forcing them too much to railroad themselves into their future self. Actually, I wouldn't had done that at all if it wasn't because there weren't enough players for the normal campaign and instead of cancelling it I choosed to improvise something that happened in their past, when their characters meet for the first time, for example.<br/><br/>What I did was frame the scene as usual, use some player's help to give good reasons to the PCs to be there and play from there. Would that meant that there wasn't any chance of character death? Well, actually I didn't worry and agreed with the players that this session could be a "what if". If something interesting came from it, good, I'd include it on the campaign. If one died but the consequences could be turned into something interesting, well there's always resurrection magic or other excuses that could be used. If it turned into a TPK then it was just a "what if" and that's it. It went good both the times I had to do it and I even didn't needed to force things there to join that with the current campaign.<br/><br/>About multiple characters, that's another tricky one. It worked for me when the players usual PCs weren't in the scene; I gave them control of some NPC present with an indication of their current mind state or possible objectives. In more adversarial PCs games (like Tenra Bansho) worked better.</blockquote>\nI have to admit I still find this quite confusing. My first encounter with the concept of "scene framing" was pemertonian scene framing as described on En World. So perhaps that is skewing my understanding of the term. But I just don't think in terms of one scene ending or another beginning. I think more in terms of time elapsing (okay this is where they are going now, so I'll have them roll a survival check, make an encounter roll and see if their journey to the house is uneventful). When they get to the house, I describe what they can see as best I can. Somehow thinking of that as a scene, with the framing that a scene has, just doesn't gel with how I think of it for me. If it is being used just to describe a particular period in the game session, then it is probably just a semantic issue and there isn't really a substantive play style difference.

I wouldn't say either is particularly wrong, we just learned them from different people in a different context. I wouldn't be surprised if more people would mean the same thing as you with "scene framing". The main thing is that basically we're doing the same thing but calling it different names. And what you call "playing with a focus on story", for me it's more or less "playing badly and using story as an excuse for it".<br/><br/>I wrote "more or less" because I reckon there's more ingrained in it, like personal preferences, sensibility towards certain techniques and things that one of us can tolerate but the other feels it ruins the game and vice-versa.\n<blockquote><br/>I think this is very individual.

Works better with players that enjoy some acting, and even then I don't give them a group of followers, but let them voice a single one, adversarial or neutral NPC only for players that aren't in the scene and thus doesn't have anything to win or loose from the situation. Also, they have to be in a somewhat adversarial mood, so these players get to make things more interesting for the rest as they get something to do while they wait for their character to get back into action.<br/><br/>As you can see, it's a veeery specific situation that wouldn't easily appear with trad games, but is more often found in japanese rpgs. Maybe you could also play VtM this way. I'd rather play myself the followers and give control of other NPCs and even monsters to guests that get to visit while we're playing a campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449993/#Comment_449993" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T15:42:45+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  3:42PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>*shrug*  Chain of consequence is about story-like <i>content</i>.

But when people railroad it's often to achieve an effect, and sometimes that effect relates to delivering a story at a pace or in a style that's more familiar from entertainment media.  Obviously there are ways to achieve a more movie-like pace (or whatever) without the GM being the one to take the reins with some predetermined authorial vision.  But in any sort of "GM runs the show" play culture, it's very unsurprising to me that this developed.

Philosophically, I think conscious scene-framing is a great practice.  But when I run immersive games I almost never actually do it.  My imagination just keeps organically rolling into "what happens next?" and that's what comes out of my mouth.<br/><br/>Until recently, I had always thought of the GM's role in immersive games as being to help the players' immersion.  But now I think that GMs who like this kind of play also like to immerse themselves.  Even if hard and deliberate scene-framing were equally immersive for the players, consciously manhandling the fiction can ruin the fun for the GM.  Running on intuition instead of plans can support the GM's sense that they aren't <i>creating</i> any fictional stuff, but merely describing it.  I am never ever going to stop my immersive roll as GM and say to myself, "Okay, what's a neat thing I can invent for this scene?"<br/><br/>At the same time, my uninformed intuition produces all sorts of random shit*, and my planning generally produces a higher quality of content and description.  So I try to do both -- plan enough before game to inform my intuition during play.  For me this means really understanding each new situation myself before the players enter it.  Usually, that's pre-session prep of a town or dungeon.

For example, I find I really need to immerse myself in NPCs, so it feels like I am viewing things from their perspective. It isn't constant, because the GM has other responsibilities. \n<blockquote>At the same time, my uninformed intuition produces all sorts of random shit*, and my planning generally produces a higher quality of content and description.

I think it amounts to the GM needs to fluidly move between perspectives and points of view in the campaign setting. You sometimes need to see things from a particular NPCs point of view to get a sense of how that character would react, but you also need that external and objective assessment of what is really going on with that character, what his resources are and how reliable his info is. \n<blockquote>I do not prep for "story" when I do this -- I prep to define the parts of the world relevant to the characters' interests and goals.

For me it is just a matter of what is driving my choices. If I am thinking in terms of story, my focus would be things like what is the dramatic pay off here. I used to run games like this. There were also times when I ran games in terms of challenge and level of excitement. Nothing wrong with dramatic payoff or excitement. I expect both to be present to a degree in most games just by the nature of how things pan out, but they don't drive my decisions anymore. My decisions are primarily driven by what I think should happen. Again, that doesn't mean what should happen isn't often exciting, but sometimes it isn't. Sometimes what should happen is the NPC the whole campaign has been building up to a big confrontation with, meekly surrenders when the players knock on his door. If I were thinking in terms of story, it would steer me more toward him going out in a blaze of glory or trying to make an epic escape. Campaigns like that can be fun, they just are not how I enjoy running or playing these days.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450005/#Comment_450005" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T21:39:09+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  9:39PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm you see, all this 'sorta' derailing just gave me a clue about an angle that I can't remember if it's mentioned before. For all I remember (sorry, right now the thread is too long for me to read quickly and I'm at my work) at most of the thread we've been comparing RPG with other media as it is fair, while RPGs are a media of its own.<br/><br/>See, even talking about story in RPGs and how it can't be compared to books, movies or theater in terms of quality doesn't make actual sense; it's almost like comparing music to books or dance to painting. It's a mixed media where the ludical component is stronger than all the media mentioned, like an art of it's own if you want.<br/><br/>You can say how the story told in the song "Hotel california" can't be compared with a Stephen King's novel but is that actually fair to any of those? It's a totally different experience!<br/><br/>So extending that back into the role of story in RPGs, being more fair we should say that though important, <i>it will always be secondary in this media right after the ludical component of it</i> We're doing this activity for fun after all. Without the ludical component present in any way and the interactivity of at least two sources of information (at it's most simplified form you would need a lone player, a database and a way to make the feedback random but somewhat sensical between those two) we would be doing just a literary exercise through brainstorming or random tables.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hmmm you see, all this 'sorta' derailing just gave me a clue about an angle that I can't remember if it's mentioned before. For all I remember (sorry, right now the thread is too long for me to read quickly and I'm at my work) at most of the thread we've been comparing RPG with other media as it is fair, while RPGs are a media of its own.<br/><br/>See, even talking about story in RPGs and how it can't be compared to books, movies or theater in terms of quality doesn't make actual sense; it's almost like comparing music to books or dance to painting. It's a mixed media where the ludical component is stronger than all the media mentioned, like an art of it's own if you want.<br/><br/>You can say how the story told in the song "Hotel california" can't be compared with a Stephen King's novel but is that actually fair to any of those? It's a totally different experience!<br/><br/>So extending that back into the role of story in RPGs, being more fair we should say that though important, <i>it will always be secondary in this media right after the ludical component of it</i> We're doing this activity for fun after all. Without the ludical component present in any way and the interactivity of at least two sources of information (at it's most simplified form you would need a lone player, a database and a way to make the feedback random but somewhat sensical between those two) we would be doing just a literary exercise through brainstorming or random tables.<br/><br/>Thoughts?</blockquote>\nWell, again, I think it is largely a semantic distinction and about how you model and understand things. If the eagles benefited from thinking in terms of what story they wanted to tell while they wrote Hotel California, it is a big enough hit at this stage, that I wouldn't second guess that. I am also a musician and that is a very different process from RPGs, but I just wrote an instrumental piece based on the siege of Constantinople. So that might indicate where my sensibilities lie there. <br/><br/>I guess my point is thinking in terms of story ended up not really producing anything helpful to me, just like thinking in terms of CR wasn't all that useful for me either. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450007/#Comment_450007" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T21:58:27+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  9:58PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2015 9:58PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            double post<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450009/#Comment_450009" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T22:22:21+00:00" title="December 14, 2015 10:22PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2015 10:22PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, W-Monk, from a "game" point of view, "story" will always be second at best in RPG play.  But not everyone adopts that point of view.  There doesn't seem to be any agreement on whether roleplay is a means to an end or an end in itself!  I could definitely see a group prioritizing "this must be satisfying to us as story audience" above all other things.  Of course, the tools to actually achieve that would have to be game-effective as you describe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450011/#Comment_450011" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T22:35:20+00:00" title="December 14, 2015 10:35PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2015 11:36PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>, do you find that thinking in purposeful terms (story, challenge, anything else you've tried) instead of naturalistic terms ("given how the setting seems to me, here's the first thing that seems to me like it'd be present") ruins your fun?

Or produces sub-par fiction?  Or both?  Or something else?</blockquote>\nNo, I don't think it produces sub par fiction, you can probably produce some pretty decent fiction purposefully trying to create a story. I do think it diminishes the experience for me by steering me away from the spontaneity of being in the moment and building on what came before. If the point of play is story, then you feel compelled to have it be a good story and I think from there, for me, it just doesn't lead to what I am after. It isn't that story isn't present or part of the mix. It is just that I try not to allow that to be part of my GM judgment on things that are happening. \n<blockquote>I always constrain myself by "what <i>could</i> be here", but sometimes my first thought of what <i>would</i> be here is not the best.

My decisions in my current setting have led to a very bloody, vengeful world where grudges beget grudges,etc, etc. That is fine. That is a consistent thing about the setting. When a player sneaks in to steal the Wind Sabre of Sunan, I don't think "what would be the most exciting thing to happen now" or "what would add to the story, or fit the development of this PC". I just think, okay what are the people at Mystic Sword Sect up to now, how well do they protect the entrances, what kind of state is Lady White Blade's room in, etc. I think in the end this produces consistency but isn't easily predictable by the players, and therefore more exciting long term. Were I doing what feels right in terms of story, I think the players could more easily guess what I am doing. <br/><br/>Just to be clear here though, this isn't about simulating a 100% realistic world or anything. It is about creating the sense that the world is concrete and real. What that takes will vary from group to group, and I allow for plenty of genre physics within that. \n<blockquote>This "searching" doesn't consist of going down some "good story" or "balanced encounter" checklist, but it does incorporate those concerns as I reach for inspiration that evokes positive play associations.

If people are using different language to describe the same thing, then there is less of a difference than meets the eye. <br/><br/>I think the end result I am looking for is for it to feel genuine. If the players see me going back to a particular kind of NPC because it worked in the past or because it is obviously about getting a particular effect, then it might be an issue. If it isn't something I perceive or they perceive, I won't worry too much about it. There is nothing wrong with making a world that is fun to explore. But fun isn't the guiding measure of the design. <br/><br/>For example if I am making a puzzle in a dungeon, obviously part of my intention is to make it fun, exciting and challenging. But it is there in the first place because it should be. And I am going to work hard to remove all artificiality that I can from it. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is just a game, so I am too worries about style purity or anything (no one is going to die in reality because of this stuff). It is more about the overall experience. When my players walk away do they feel like the NPCs they met were real,do they feel like the world had a certain believability about it.

What I meant was more going along the lines of how we think of RPGs primarily as games. It's in the name: Role Playing Game. We most often say "Let's play this RPG" instead of saying "Let's make a story using this RPG" (that while perfectly possible it hasn't become a trend by some reason) We rarely take RPGs as a mean to obtain a story since one of the first things that come to mind when we thing of what we find rewarding about the game is getting together to do something revolving creativity, a shared imagined space and stuff happening. Of course there's the plus that in the best case we will remember this fondly and piece it together as a vivid memory in the form of a story.<br/><br/>So this comes before the way we play it, where of course we can focus then on the story, the game, the acting, etc to achieve immersion in whatever suits us best. Even if we're talking of a story game with barely any game-like recognizable component, there's the interaction, competivity on how creative you can go, how well you can perform or surprise other players, etc.<br/><br/>I was going this way away from the "story oriented way of playing" issue we've been discussing lately and back into the original thread, where things were left more or less at "You can't make quality stories playing RPGs" before it derrailed tino "because playing with story as a focus ruins the experience in X way"\n<blockquote><br/>Well, again, I think it is largely a semantic distinction and about how you model and understand things. If the eagles benefited from thinking in terms of what story they wanted to tell while they wrote Hotel California, it is a big enough hit at this stage, that I wouldn't second guess that. I am also a musician and that is a very different process from RPGs, but I just wrote an instrumental piece based on the siege of Constantinople. So that might indicate where my sensibilities lie there. <br/></blockquote>\nMy example was more along the lines of "to make a better story, you have to focus on making a better story, not in making the music that goes with it better" though doing both is perfectly possible. It's just that doing both parts good is one hell of a challenge even for someone who is talented on doing both at the same time.\n<blockquote><br/>I guess my point is thinking in terms of story ended up not really producing anything helpful to me, just like thinking in terms of CR wasn't all that useful for me either. <br/></blockquote>\nThat's okey. We all have different ways of doing things. Most of the supposed problem we thought we were seeing with your view on story-focused gameplay just came form the misunderstanding on the semantics. David, translating what Bedrockbrendan said about story oriented gameplay into the semantics you and me are more used to, he's just saying that bad story oriented gameplay gets on his nerves, while he uses good story oriented gameplay a lot but doesn't call it that way, because the s-word triggers on him the course of thinking that leads to bad story oriented gameplay. I'd say it's legit, there's no need for us to go passive-defensive on story-oriented gameplay. The discussion has been totally civil, nice, tolerant, good and instructive so far, but I feel it's bound to get annoying eventually; we don't need to make Bedrockbrendan a story-believer nor defend our belief, we're all doing more or less the same but just calling it different names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450017/#Comment_450017" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T05:34:25+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  5:34AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For bad story-oriented gameplay examples, I just recalled one this morning while answering another post. I pre-wrote an scenario where PCs had to stop a golem rushing out of control into the city. The twist was that the golem had the spirit of the previous king who had their loyal technicians turning him into that when he got letally wounded so they could win a war. Once the war ended, the king would came back running to the palace looking for the queen and to prevent that scene the PCs had to stop him. Of course , they wouldn't be told inmediately about the identity of the soul inside the golem. <br/><br/>And there was a catch: The queen had been cheating on the king with one of his generals. So I thought and prepared for three possibilities: the general arives first, the king finds him with the queen and in rage, kills them both. The king arrives first and the party has to rescue the princess from the golem. The players stop the golem on the road and the truth never surfaces. The thing is that in the end it became an epic pursuit across the city which finished at the palace... and then I ruined it by using all of the prep on a single improvised scene tweaking the numbers so the golem would find the queen and then the general would come to her rescue. <br/><br/>I resolved the action as if the players had beaten the king before reaching the castle though. He surrendered without a battle and asked them to end his existance, which gave another party member a good excuse for avenging a servant that got killed for a minor fault against the king (he hadn't ordered her to be killed but also felt responsible) and putting her ghost at ease.<br/><br/>The thing is, despite all the prep and going for the big reveal at the end, the whole thing didn't end up being memorable nor good enough to excuse that tweaking from my part. It made felt the epic party effort was for nothing and took the game component by force, just leaving a bad story oriented gameplay aftertaste for me. That campaign ended up prematurely and among the few things I rescued from it was that while prep definitely does a diference, prep for player-defined twists ruins the fun. <br/><br/>Today I leave that part up to them and I just embellish and justify things with the narration, while orienting my prep to build new bangs from the consequences of the player's actions. My NPCs now doesn't have a pre-written story to be told, they have an agenda with clear objectives, motivations and means, that could change due to the PCs actions. And that's it. The story twists will be up to whatever the players do. Also, bangs everywhere. A dragon appears carrying a wounded king on his paws and drops him in the jungle the PCs are crossing, then leaves. What they do with it it's up to them. They want to kill the king and loot him? Oh, that's okey, that doesn't wreck any prep I've done but will give me a major consequence to make prep upon; Now there would be a group of loyal knights finding the rests and bent on avenging their king.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450018/#Comment_450018" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T06:01:31+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  6:01AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2015 6:16AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a tricky thing in RPG chats, right?

If they buy a dickish NPC, then I don't see an issue. My concerns are much more focused on once that NPC is play, how you manage his actions and behavior. <br/><br/>But genuineness is still at stake in such a situation. If it boils down to a coin flip, sure there is a lot you can paint on something without it being an issue. However, is a matter of whether you making the Baron a dick feels like it was done for some other reason than it is how he ought to be. You flip a coin enough times, and it comes up heads every time, that may feel weird to people. That doesn't  mean other reasons won't factor in. But why you are doing it can matter if it becomes obvious. So if I keep introducing dickish NPCs because it seems to work, eventually the players will notice that pattern I think. Eventually it starts to feel like "well this guy isn't just a dick because that is how he ended up, he is a Dick because it helps the GM achieve something he is going for in the game". That may or may not be an issue for a particular group. This is something I consciously try to avoid. I have NPC types I love as well. And in some cases, they are naturally a product of the setting (in a world of feuding sects and blood grudges, where people have powerful Kung Fu, you are going to have a few maniacs roaming around who basically can just do what they like cause no one can stop them). In other cases, they may just be my own preference becoming too strong, or me leaning on something that felt like it worked in the past. Here what I would say is it isn't a matter of avoiding the fun factor, it is a matter of asking "is this becoming obvious as a GM crutch, is this choice taking away from the sense of a believable world". If the answer is no, then I would go for it. \n<blockquote>I'm curious how you feel about this if we trim away all the stuff that <i>fights</i> authenticity, and just talk about the stuff that could (maybe) supplement it.

I am not saying that is bad. I made an NPC who goes around smashing peoples teeth and collecting them because he believes it will help him get into a prestigious group of bandits (a notion that is completely incorrect). The reason I made him was I thought it was a fun character. But there does come a point where if 50 NPCs are strangely perfectly suited for a particular brand of excitement, that the pattern can become discernible. For me it is more about the total experience. It is kind of like playing a musical instrument and avoiding leaning on certain modes or patterns on the fret board. Again though, the real focus for me is once the pieces have been established and in play. Prior to placement in the game, it is kind of a void that anything can spew from. The only question I am asking there isn't 'am I making the game too fun', it is 'will the players buy this?"<br/><br/>Perhaps you already answered these questions, with this:\n<blockquote>I do think it diminishes the experience for me by steering me away from the spontaneity of being in the moment and building on what came before.</blockquote>\nBut a lot of your comments that followed were about pitfalls that I don't think are actually entailed by the sort of "searching" I've done, so I'm wondering where we're at if we drop those concerns.  <br/><br/>Or maybe the second you start thinking non-spontaneously, you wind up producing inauthentic stuff?

I have the same priorities you do, and I don't lose track of them just because some notion of "what'd be good here?" also enters the equation.<br/><br/>At the same time, I should admit that "take a second to think through what comes next" has <i>never</i> come <i>naturally</i> to me.  Sometimes I think that the right tool (roll-on table? not sure) would make a big difference.<br/><br/><br/>Well, if 'what ought to happen here' and 'what is fun' both intersect there isn't a problem. Again it isn't about avoiding fun, or avoiding a good story, it is about those not being the overarching goal. It is about avoiding the 'tyranny of fun' and about avoiding a series of events that feel artificial or out of step with what ought to be going on. This is why I keep pointing to history more as the model. There can be good stories in history. There can be fun, drama, passion, surprises and humor. All these things can exist in history, but they are never assured. The forces driving history forward are not concerned about producing these things. I want the GM to <i>feel</i> more like these forces, than like an author or director. Feel is the key word here. And I think a given setting can have different forces driving things. For me that just produces a more genuine experience of being there at the table. <br/><br/>Importantly I am not saying this is true for everyone. If you are going for a similar style and you have different ways of measuring you own judgment, and that is working, no need to change anything. For me, I find it very important to occasionally ask why I am making a particular call, to ask if it really is what ought to happen. Because there are absolutely many, many times in a campaign where what would make a good story, what would be the most fun, and what ought to happen are all at odds with one another. When you come down forcefully on what ought to be, it is striking, it gives weight to the world and its consequences. It is George RR Martin like I suppose, but to me that is a case of story emulating the forces of history.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450038/#Comment_450038" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T19:20:43+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  7:20PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2015 7:23PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a sidenote, I think it's notable that gamers who are heavily in "story play", and want their games to produce remarkable and memorable stories, tend (in my limited experience) to separate into different 'streams' or 'cultures' or play.<br/><br/>(I'm talking about game groups who wants to experience "story" as a highlight of their gaming, as opposed to gamers who want to play to challenge each other's skills, explore a physics simulation, play out a complex boardgame, or any other aim.)<br/><br/>One type of game/group/gamer wants their roleplaying to produce amazing stories, and fully embraces the nature of the game as a story-producing process, including lots of discussion about what would be "coolest" and a great willingness to transform the story as it goes along. (For instance, such a group might say, "Hey, the Q<br/>ueen's wedding didn't quite go as well as it could have. How about we play that part again, and make it better?" Or, perhaps, "Hey, it would be really cool if my guy, who seems like a villain, turns out to be a hero at the end. Would you support that, in the future, by having your character pester him about his mother?" That would, of course, be anathema to many other game styles.)<br/><br/>They see themselves as authors of a story and want to develop as creatively as possible, and all try to challenge themselves and each other constantly to improve the quality of the resulting fiction and how "cool" or clever or memorable it is.<br/><br/>(There is an analogue here with fiction writers who follow models of storytelling, including ideas like the need to "introduce a twist in Act 3", and plan out their stories in advance.)<br/><br/>Another type, however, aims at a similar result - hard-hitting, memorable stories - but sees the process as one which prioritizes emotional engagement. The desired process is to immerse in the emotions of the characters and the gut-wrenching moments and dilemmas created as the story goes along. They do NOT want any above-board "storytelling" or transparent manipulation of events; indeed, those things would be "foul play" to such a group.<br/><br/>They want the developing fiction to be "feral", constantly evolving, taking on a life of its own. They throw difficult situations at passionate characters and want to be surprised by what happens. Any kind of planning ahead is anathema here, as would be a "do-over"; the idea is to let the "story" take its own direction and enjoy the twists it presents.<br/><br/>In any given moment, the characters are intended to act as naturalistically as possible (a character taking action without due motivation, simply because it seems like it would create a cool plot twist, would be "cheating" here), to let story emerge from their actions organically.<br/><br/>Again, there is an analogue with novelists (Stephen King is a good example) who make a point of not planning out stories, and do not seek to recreate existing "plot formulas", or anything of the sort. These writers want to be surprised even *themselves* as they write their books or stories! They often describe the process of writing as one of discovery, where the "characters seem to act of their own volition", and surprise even the author with what happens. <br/><br/>While the aims of the two groups (speaking very loosely, of course) are similar, the process they go through to produce it is so different that they would not do well to play together without any adjustments. <br/><br/>Some of their techniques might be very useful to a group who says they are not interested in "playing for story", and some might be terribly unsuited. There's a lot of diversity here - my main point here is not to assume that all "story gamers'" groups fall into either of those camps.<br/><br/>Incidentally, George R.R. Martin is an excellent example of an author who is clearly creating story (after all, he is a novelist...) but doesn't seek to recreate existing plot formulae. Instead, his fiction seems to progress very naturalistically - this makes his stories (to some, anyway) seem "real", in that they sound a lot like a historical account. We don't know the *process* he uses to get there, of course (maybe he's got a detailed plot chart and each event fits into it perfectly, creating some unusual form of plot progression we're not familiar with, as readers)...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450039/#Comment_450039" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T20:23:32+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  8:23PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Incidentally, George R.R.

He's also mentioned in quite a few interviews that he reads more history books than fantasy novels. I do realize that Game of Thrones is indeed a work of fiction. I get that he is telling a tale. He is using history as a way of subverting expectations. And Martin is often taking the most dramatic aspects of history to help him tell his story. In real history important people don't just die in a bloody betrayal at a wedding, they also die of fever from bacterial infections on their way to to a settlement. History doesn't care about stuff like dramatic pacing. <br/><br/>My point is that it is a case of fiction looking outside its medium, to history, for inspiration. An RPG that looks to history in the same way, isn't really looking to emulate stories...it is trying to emulate the way events pan out in real life. In fact one of the things historians look for in documents to judge their content is whether the text appears to contain literary patterns. That is often a dead give away that something other than the genuine event is being presented to the reader. <br/><br/>History is still plenty exciting in its own way. It just isn't framed in the same way a story is.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450040/#Comment_450040" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T20:46:14+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  8:46PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan, cool.

Sounds like you've moved from one thing that some people would call "story focused" to a different thing that different people would call "story focused".  So much for that label.<br/></blockquote>\nHeh, ok, part is my bad, I'm no game theorist and my memory is feeble with the terms I've read before but here and then some crazy idea gets into my mind and I'm wondering if it's been heard before. I merely switched from pushing the players to follow my own story interests to building the story according to the interests of the player and the consequences of their actions, enforcing the feeling that they actually are changing the world.<br/><br/>But basically, It's enough if you get rid of the "pushing" part. Forcing players to accept your tastes ruins the immersion, specially if some of them are actually in the mood for "game" immersion instead of "story" immersion.<br/><br/>About this particular, it's one of that crazy ideas the cling to my mind lately: RPGs being a mixed media, generate overlapping types of immersion, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes excluding. Player/GM tolerance helps to switch from one to another without ruining the Flow. Yet as Brendan's case put in evidence, techniques used to achieve immersion/foster tolerance/maintain flow in one aspect of the game can actually break immersion in other aspects of the game.<br/><br/>See, in my frustrated pursuit example, going for story immersion broke game immersion and made player's actions felt useless. In Brandon's experience, going for story immersion broke world-logic immersion (not sure I should call it simulationist immersion at all, it's an old label not too many people use or like today). In my first bad experiences with D&amp;D "game immersion" broke both story and world-logic immersion. It also had to do with the GM forcing the story, but even then that experience could probably be salvageable if we had agreed before the game that the GM would force things here and there for the sake of providing a challenge as a game. We would have taken then those moments as a signal that "we won the game part, let's go on with the story" and immediately stop bickering about it before ruining the overall immersion.\n<blockquote><br/>With the kind of play Brendan and I are talking about, "manhandle the fiction for the big reveal" is definitely no good, while "run NPCs true to their motives" and "play out the consequences of player character actions" are perfectly compatible.  As for "think in terms of bangs when prepping", I'm not sure.</blockquote>\nNow you're making me doubt of my understanding of what Bangs are supposed to mean. I meant that I often prep things just up to the point of scene framing or up to the moment where, for a plausible reason, PCs can't interrupt whatever is happening. Of course these pieces of prep aren't interconnected in any temporal order that requires the previous one to had place. <br/><br/>Also, these things will often be triggered by the PCs arriving somewhere or when certain conditions are otherwise met. Others can be told by a witness instead of happening th the presence of the players. The prep that comes up from the consequences of players actions somewhat follows the same formula. If an NPC swears vengeance on the PCs, it may take a while but eventually I'll reintroduce her in a scene as a more prepared character, with new skills and allies as well as with some sort of plan. But neither that scene nor the ones I have prepped will have a predetermined way of being solved. That part will be up to the players to improvise. <br/><br/>In all cases, these scenes are supposed to happen whenever the players don't know what to do, to keep the action from stalling. Whenever the players want to do something I just follow them around and save my prep for later. So, that's why I meant with "Bangs". How wrong am I with the term and use btw?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450043/#Comment_450043" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T21:43:44+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  9:43PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Brendan, cool.

You could devise some core principles based on thinking it through or discussion but if we are misguided, wrong or just not thinking clearly at any point here, we could establish some measure or guideline that totally doesn't work in practice for reasons that just are not obvious at the moment. So I say just try things at the table, keep what works, eventually let go of what doesn't seem to work. <br/><br/>I think in terms of design for immersionists it is more a matter of not inserting mechanics that interfere than about creating ones that might aid immersion. For immersion you kind of want mechanics to fade in the background as well as possible. How that is going to work for individuals will vary and countless pages of debate have been spent all over the net on the subject. Knowing how your players react to things is key. Generally though I find stuff that pulls people out of the character's headspace always runs the risk of breaking immersion. Sometimes that is unavoidable (if players are tracking their own HP for example, they will occasionally have to step out of their character's headspace to adjust that). Justin Alexander has a bunch of articles on dissociated mechanics. He's revised his thoughts on the subject a few times, and the original article isn't without controversy, but I find thinking about avoiding blatantly dissociated mechanics a pretty helpful way to go forward here (if the goal is immersion). Again I am reluctant to to make a rule out of it. But I do keep an eye on things that seem dissociative when I am designing. <br/><br/>As an example, I like Savage Worlds a lot. My business partner, who was also a player and GM in my groups, liked the system too, but HATED bennies. Like he really, really, hated them and couldn't help himself from commenting any time they came up. At one point I had a long conversation with him about them, and his objection was two-fold: his first point was just about the fairness of issuing bennies. Not relevant to this discussion but he disliked that the GM just handed them out for perceived good RP. The other point was that his character had no idea what a benny was. There was no way for him to connect what his character was trying to do with what the benny meant in the game. It wasn't effort. It wasn't a resource that his character had any real control over. It was more like star power. The issue with him spending bennies was it immediately pulled him out of his character's headspace. Now bennies are a popular mechanic in savage worlds, I don't think they should get rid of them, but if I were making the "immersionists" edition of the game, I'd probably turn bennies into something more like will or effort, where you can kind of visualize how those points are a product of your character concentrating, and I might shift them to the GM side (so if the player says "I try really hard" the GM users one of the player's bennies). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450048/#Comment_450048" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T23:25:34+00:00" title="December 15, 2015 11:25PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2015 11:26PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, the question of <i>all</i> mechanics in immersive gaming is definitely vast!

It's been a  while since I got to chat about such things, so it's been nice having your perspective in here.  Thanks for keeping up with my bombardment of questions!<br/><br/>The one immersion-friendly piece of work I have in presentable shape is a <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">series of comics</a> outlining how to work from the fiction, in practical, social terms.  It's mostly trouble-shooting; I haven't gotten around to posting the comic that shows what it looks like when everything's running smoothly.  For someone with your play background, these comics are probably completely unnecessary, but I am curious if this series is compatible with your play style, and also whether you might find it (or something like it) handy to introduce this sort of play to someone who hasn't done it before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450052/#Comment_450052" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T00:22:23+00:00" title="December 16, 2015 12:22AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Heh, ok, part is my bad, I'm no game theorist and my memory is feeble with the terms I've read before but here and then some crazy idea gets into my mind and I'm wondering if it's been heard before.</blockquote>\nI don't think it's your bad at all!  I think the history of how such stuff has been discussed in RPG-land is messy, that's all.  There's "the GM's story" railroad play and then there's "Story Now" play and a million other uses of the term floating around.  Regardless, your examples were concrete, and I knew what you meant.  You've gone from pushing the events of play in a particular direction to instead seeing where the characters take things.<br/><br/>Honestly, from what I remember of your group's play style, where you're often messing with each other and trying to get one over on each other, I figured some lines of impartial arbitration -- rules, explicit principles, whatever -- would be pretty important.  So, yeah, any sort of "just because the GM feels like it" forcing the story sounds risky there, unless everyone's totally on board for that as part of the overt parameters of play.  I'm glad things are going well since your switch in approach!\n<blockquote>About this particular, it's one of that crazy ideas the cling to my mind lately: RPGs being a mixed media, generate overlapping types of immersion, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes excluding. Player/GM tolerance helps to switch from one to another without ruining the Flow. Yet as Brendan's case put in evidence, techniques used to achieve immersion/foster tolerance/maintain flow in one aspect of the game can actually break immersion in other aspects of the game.<br/><br/>See, in my frustrated pursuit example, going for story immersion broke game immersion and made player's actions felt useless. In Brandon's experience, going for story immersion broke world-logic immersion (not sure I should call it simulationist immersion at all, it's an old label not too many people use or like today). In my first bad experiences with D&amp;D "game immersion" broke both story and world-logic immersion. It also had to do with the GM forcing the story, but even then that experience could probably be salvageable if we had agreed before the game that the GM would force things here and there for the sake of providing a challenge as a game. We would have taken then those moments as a signal that "we won the game part, let's go on with the story" and immediately stop bickering about it before ruining the overall immersion.</blockquote>\nGreat point!  Getting what you want out of the social dynamic, the challenge element, the fiction, and the mode of experience, all at once, is super complicated.  I think that, if no one cares about anything else, experiential immersion is basically solved by POV freeform.  Everyone speaks in character, the GM says what happens, that's it.  The problem is that, by itself, this doesn't give the players any interesting choices to make.  They're fully transported to another reality, but it's completely on the GM to make that reality meaningfully (instead of inconsequentially) interactive.  So now we veer away from freeform and bring in some rules (e.g. "roll to succeed"), but the rules interface introduces a new split between player and character experience, so already you have trade-offs (I've often considered letting the GM roll all the dice for this very reason) and it just takes off from there...<br/><br/>I think your point about "player/GM tolerance helps to switch from one to another without ruining the Flow" sounds promising -- care to say more?  We could discuss here, or in a new thread if you think the topic has some length to it.\n<blockquote>Now you're making me doubt of my understanding of what Bangs are supposed to mean.</blockquote>\nI am not well-versed in the history of how they've been used over time.  The model that stuck in my head is "GM comes up with a bunch of 'bang! this happens! you can't ignore it! what do you do?!' moments to potentially use in play or not as appropriate."<br/><br/>The techniques you describe, such as "write bangs based on what the PCs have done before" and "use certain ones when PCs arrive in certain places" certainly sound like good ways to go about it to me!\n<blockquote>I often prep things just up to the point of scene framing or up to the moment where, for a plausible reason, PCs can't interrupt whatever is happening.</blockquote>\nHmm.  Prepping scenes vs prepping events sounds a little different to me.  Not sure how different it is in practice.\n<blockquote>In all cases, these scenes are supposed to happen whenever the players don't know what to do, to keep the action from stalling. Whenever the players want to do something I just follow them around and save my prep for later.</blockquote>\nThat use of bangs makes sense to me!  It's not what I inferred from Sorcerer chat -- my impression was that they were just as valid as complications to whatever the PCs were already up to -- but again, I don't know how the term's use now might be different from 2001.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450068/#Comment_450068" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T16:28:56+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  4:28PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2015 4:29PM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>I think that, if no one cares about anything else, experiential immersion is basically solved by POV freeform.

Lately I've been using a deck much like my old resourcefull deck to make traps and dungeons. I'm quite satisfied about how it came out; it gives you a trigger for the trap and the effect that trigger will have. In gameplay I found to my surprise that having these two things made traps an incredibly  organic puzzle. A perception roll is still needed for players to find about it, but then skills like "disarm traps" become unnecessary. Players can try to find and avoid or jam the trigger or figure what kind of movement or noise will trigger it. Or they can try to stop the effect from having place or move out of the way before it happens. It suddenly become a problem that both the GM and players could narrate their actions through, instead of a bit of narration that a single dice roll resolves.<br/><br/>Second part of the idea: When I finally understood how the AW engine works through World of Dungeons I was amazed how well it worked. The GM narrates how a threat or obstacle starts taking shape in front of the player, then the player gets to decide their action or reaction. Rolls happen, if player succeeds it starts all over again with the same or the next player, if not the threat becomes inmediate and next failed roll means something bad happens. On top of that, good rolls open additional opportunities to the player, the next of the whole group. And you can totally disregard initiative as the order of the actions becomes more organic. Does it make sense this player should go next? We jump to her turn. Does anybody has a good idea about what to do? it's their turn then. Things are stalling a bit? Time for the opponents to steal the initiative and do something by themselves.<br/><br/>Now BAM! stick those things together! If there's a way most challenges in the shared imagined space could be reduced in the GM side to one or more "triggers" and one or more effects, by using that basic part of the AW engine about how complications scale and resolve until some good or bad interesting thing happens, and perhaps some diceless conflict resolution mechanic that favors how much advantages/disadvantages you have to accomplish whatever you're trying to do, you could probably end up with something quite immersive. Switch to GM rolling dice whenever players resort to mere luck or some sort of resource expenditure, like beanies only used by the GM.<br/><br/>Also, I recall that mechanic from the Wildlings RPG, where you actions could get certain descriptors but negate others according to how you choose to perform them. You could be silent and precise, but that would take strong and cautious out of the question, so your sneak attack would hit surprising the opponent but wouldn't probably do enough damage to kill him, and then you would be out in the open for their retaliation. It's perhaps adding lots of things for the GM to control but if it's for the sake of Immersion I think it could be perfectly doable.\n<blockquote><br/>I think your point about "player/GM tolerance helps to switch from one to another without ruining the Flow" sounds promising -- care to say more?  We could discuss here, or in a new thread if you think the topic has some length to it.<br/></blockquote>\nHeh, well, it isn't enough there to derrail this thread anyway. I just meant that as the players and GM are each one more or less focused on having their fun, it's each other's duty to be somewhat tolerant and let each other have their fun and wait for the opportunity to have their own. If we could agreed from the start for a signal for switching from one form of fun to another and back, that could help foster tolerance, so the switch cab be faster and with less stalling / discomfort from the players who don't like X or Y kind of fun. For example, If that tweaking that I did were a previously agreed move, then at my signal players would have inmediatly understood "oh, we won the game part and now we're going into story mode, yay!" instead of going "what we won the game part and the story keeps going as if we hadn't? that sucks!", without changing anything anything else on how I tackled the scene.<br/><br/>Though the use of a signal itselt sorta breaks immersion a bit, even a player that enjoys immersion most would find easier to be tolerant and let the GM had his fun with the story, Then the GM could switch back to immersion, even with the aid of that player.<br/><br/>The signal shouldn't be anything too complex, nor interrupting. It should be enough with a common language cue over which we will add another layer of meaning, that would probably get explained by itself after a new player sees it in use a couple of times, becoming quickly a second nature for all the players.<br/><br/>For example, we are all familiar with the usual signals a GM uses to start or resume playing. She most usually waits for the precise moments the players conversations die a little to raise his voice and start narrating/describing the scene (What we usually call Scene Framing), so their reaction is to make silence, pay attention and go into immersive mood. The GM also uses some visual contact to signal the players to pay attention, while keeping a brief silence. He can even clap his hands or make other sudden move to call for everyone's attention. He can talk in character, something that is most of the time impossible to miss as the players see how the GM suddenly changes his attitude towards them. All these have their own uses and overlaying meanings. The signal I'm talking about shouldn't be too different to that.<br/><br/>In fact, there are already a few ones in use. Whenever comes the time for switching to the game immersion, the GM would ask the players to roll the dice, even just by simply extending his hand to the place where the dice are to the player would get the drift, pick 'em up and roll. Whenever I could acknowledge that the players have won the game part, I could rise my hands and look aside in defeat and resume narration, even using some railroading. Players won't mind as long as that signal is there to acknowledge that they have won over me, something that means everything for the gamists. But of course, adding that extra layer of meaning over those signals from the start of the game is what is needed to foster the tolerance as I explained, as for themselves they could still be misinterpretated or not given the whole dimension of added meaning needed for them to work properly.<br/><br/>So you see, this is another reason why some games work better with some groups. If their signals are more clear and better defined (usually because they know each other better and have developed such signals trough the years with the aid of more expressive people and different game experiences) it will definitely be easier for them to read them and react (or not react at all) accordingly.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450070/#Comment_450070" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T17:27:01+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  5:27PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2015 5:29PM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>I often prep things just up to the point of scene framing or up to the moment where, for a plausible reason, PCs can't interrupt whatever is happening.</blockquote>\nHmm.

Before I would prep the whole scene thinking of what the players could do and the possible options they could take, prepping for every single one I could thought as if writing a "choose your own adventure" book, on top of which I would improvise if the players did something different.<br/><br/>I used to prep more or less flexible scenes or even chains of scenes this way and drop the proper places on the map for the campaign. I had to do enough material for two or three sessions, prepping as much as I could in advance and holding up for the rest until the next session was over, so I could adapt and prep again against whatever the players did in that session. <br/><br/>The problem was that all this effort burnt me as a GM and eventually I started to prep less and railroad more. I also felt my prep was somewhat becoming previsible, that I was repeating myself in terms of plots and story arcs. So I started to hear the players more, using procedures that added lots of their input to the game (mostly ones that favored brainstorming instead of giving them the responsability of creating something for the whole group to value, which is the main cause of blank page syndrome)  and then anything that could help me deal with giving coherence with that. I've got a nick for giving coherence to any kind of mix if I know enough reference material about, so I've got that in my favour.<br/><br/>That's why now it has come to me at the point where all I need is these kind of bangs, and also some details and color, which I often add after the facts or the dice have made them important. All the rest I can improvise, ask the players to fill (in a Mountain Witch fashion so it doesn't interrupt immersion too much; it's like asking to their characters things they are supposed to know anyway, and then it's up to me to give shape, life and detail to whatever vague thing they mention)<br/><br/>I recall one of the last sessions in my D&amp;D campaign where these things worked wonders. I was GMing a loose version of the Mines of Phandelver module as an introduction and way to drive somewhere our sandbox campaign. So, when the PCs arrive to the valley where the Cragmire Castle stands to rescue their former patron I had them stealth around the jungle surrounding the castle to get there unnoticed.<br/><br/>I improvised a few random encounters triggered by bad perception rolls of the ranger. I had one with some stirges, another with a carrion crawler and a couple more I can't remember. It was fun with the stirges, okey with the second but when they found the carrion crawler, though it started good I felt at middle combat that the joke was starting to get old, so I dropped a bang. <br/><br/>I interrupted the battle to describe how a sudden gust of wind sends leaves flying everywhere movien fiercely the canopy of the trees above them. They notice though, that it has a rythm, as if it was... the wings of a really big creature flying low. The players eyes open wide as they go "DRAGOOON!", which made the night for me. The carrion crawler and all other creatures in the forest stampede away and I ask them a fortutude roll to grab to something or get sent flying. They also heard somebody screaming as the dragon flies past; it looks like it's holding someone prisioner.<br/><br/>They hear the dragon land ahead and then leave a few minutes after. Also, they notice how a patrol of hobgoblins returns to the castle in a rush and locks the doors. XD this last part was improvised, but seeing as how this could have turned into a series of random encounters (well, they were different and fun but playing battle after battle becomes frustratingly repetitive after a while) a serious change of pace was needed. We even had another encounter before arriving to the castle but due to the change of pace it didn't felt wrong. They ended runing from it which was okay, it was just a couple of swamp plants, so nothing to be gained there.<br/><br/>They had fun. For me the next best thing is that now they know there's a dragon involved in the adventure, it's plotting something and it has something to do with the king of a nearby nation, which was the guy the dragon brough and dropped on the forest after talking with him, which is now helping the party until they can return him to their escort. I've know what is going on based on each NPCs motivations and agenda, but I haven't prep a single scene about it. Well I've got an idea for a bang when they find the king's escort, but it's due to change to fit whatever the players do next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450071/#Comment_450071" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T17:28:07+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  5:28PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2015 5:28PM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Triple post :P<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450112/#Comment_450112" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-19T07:49:10+00:00" title="December 19, 2015  7:49AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, hosting and holiday planning are eating my time, so I'm only replying to stuff quickly right now.

I'm quite satisfied about how it came out; it gives you a trigger for the trap and the effect that trigger will have.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think if you're introducing formal techniques into immersion (e.g. perception rolls) then it helps to have them refer directly back to fictional particulars (e.g. "there's a thing that looks like this, which apparently is a trigger") rather than skipping over the interactivity with a summary (e.g. "good roll means you disarm it! somehow...").<br/><br/>If you have a good list of triggers, I'd love to see it!\n<blockquote>Does anybody has a good idea about what to do? It's their turn then. Things are stalling a bit? Time for the opponents to steal the initiative and do something by themselves.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is something I've generally done intuitively, but for groups for whom it's counter-intuitive, having some tools sounds like a good call.<br/><br/>Preceding every "something happens!" with "something is coming; what do you do?" is also a technique I use constantly.  Or, well, not "something is coming" every time, but some sort of prompt before it's too late to think and choose.  "You notice a strange smell," or whatever.\n<blockquote>Now BAM! stick those things together! If there's a way most challenges in the shared imagined space could be reduced in the GM side to one or more "triggers" and one or more effects, by using that basic part of the AW engine about how complications scale and resolve until some good or bad interesting thing happens . . . you could probably end up with something quite immersive.</blockquote>\nHmm.  I'm not sure if you're describing what I do already or not.<br/><br/>I do describe "here's what you see/hear/smell" first.  And what I describe is generally something that can be analyzed/interacted with.  So that's the "trigger", right?  And then, I know enough about the situation that when the players make their move, I have some idea what sort of things will happen from what sorts of actions.  That's "effect", right?  And then whichever player has an idea talks first, and whoever is most committed to acting acts first, and stuff happens as befits the flow of the conversation and our vision of fictional time.  Is that what you meant by "that basic part of the AW engine"?  Or are you envisioning more than I've just covered?  Die rolls or something?  I don't know how WoD's basic moves differ from AW's.\n<blockquote>Switch to GM rolling dice whenever players resort to mere luck</blockquote>\nYeah, modeling character knowledge via die size or die roller (i.e. player/GM) is something I've tried.  Impact seems to be small but not zero.\n<blockquote>Also, I recall that mechanic from the Wildlings RPG, where you actions could get certain descriptors but negate others according to how you choose to perform them. You could be silent and precise, but that would take strong and cautious out of the question, so your sneak attack would hit surprising the opponent but wouldn't probably do enough damage to kill him, and then you would be out in the open for their retaliation. It's perhaps adding lots of things for the GM to control but if it's for the sake of Immersion I think it could be perfectly doable.</blockquote>\nGood system modeling of fictional variables serves, I think, to create a tension between immersion and utility.  The more situation-dependent you make it, the more it's just "read the fiction; oh, and also, if it applies, this".  The more situation-independent you make it, the more you start manhandling the fiction or metagaming.

I noticed when I went to a small party at a friend's apartment and it turned out lot of the people there were roleplayers.

I'd say their intuition has always been right, it's just that the way our brain works makes things a bit fuzzy and in the light of the things mentioned in this thread, we should probably open the term to mean some more stuff, maybe in a slightly different way.<br/><br/>Why is that? Why I'm bringing up this "story now" forgite thing? well, the term means something different to me now, like "we're making/playing this game to add literary value quicker into the game, so the process of making it into a better quality story in our minds is faster and needs less effort"<br/><br/>So, Story Games is still a perfectly applicable term; it certainly gives a common ground to a lot of games specialized in helping players produce -though play and practically in real time*- stories with elements of enough strength and quality to leave memorable moments printed in the minds of the players. Today these games have developed enough psychological/ communicational technology to help us bring to live content focused on different genres and variations/reinterpretations of those genres.<br/><br/>*It took some alcohol, time and retelling the same stories a few times before we could come up with a good way of delivering the anecdotes, we had to add some detail and extra flavor to make that delivery particularly good. However comparing it to, say, the Fiasco game Will Wheaton played on Tabletop, makes me believe that story games certainly excel at improving the quality of the material; perhaps at the expense of being a bit non-intuitive at play (no big problem after getting some system mastery), focusing on a specific genre/atmosphere (which is totally fine) and/or requiring creative players, or more precisely, players quick on producing quality material close to the most representative reference material from that genre or atmosphere (somewhat harder to find/train but not impossible)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450926/#Comment_450926" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-27T15:53:50+00:00" title="January 27, 2016  3:53PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;players quick on producing quality material close to the most representative reference material from that genre or atmosphere (somewhat harder to find/train but not impossible)&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the biggest issues I've faced in getting consistently satisfying play out of certain Story Games.

As a GM you're ruining two things whenever you do that summary: the potential of the scene and the habit of the players to describe more. If you set the example and describe as much as you can, most probably the players will follow. If not, at least they won't find it too uncomfortable whenever you ask them to describe more.\n<blockquote><br/>If you have a good list of triggers, I'd love to see it!<br/></blockquote>\nI just added them <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16174/randomizer-for-framing-scenes-creating-challenges-making-dungeons-and-more#latest" rel="nofollow">here!</a>\n<blockquote><br/>Preceding every "something happens!" with "something is coming; what do you do?" is also a technique I use constantly.

I don't know how WoD's basic moves differ from AW's.<br/></blockquote>\nNot exactly. Well, I do most the things you describe here for different scenes. Like, when playing Offline (my game) this sunday with a group of kids, I described how they heard something coming at them through a field of high pasture and noticed the tips of a couple of horns rising from the pastures. Then I asked each one "Okey, what do you do?". It's somewhat generic, so they could either prepare, hide, analyze it further, attack, etc.<br/><br/>For traps specifically I describe what the players can see; sometimes the trigger is obvious but not necessarily threatening. Like a ray of light over the floor that activates the trap only if it's interrupted; there I'd only describe the ray of light mixed with the description of the room/corridor. <br/><br/>If players analyze the ray or corridor further I have them roll perception. Depending on the success and the nature of the trap I could describe different things on a successfully low roll and a high one. For example, if the trap turns out to be more noticeable than the trigger, I'd describe how the still inactive trap looks like, for example, a closed hatch on the ceiling, without no signs to tell how it opens or way to access it easily like a ladder or rope. (so it's clear it's not an storing place or something).<br/><br/>Yet analyzing the place doesn't have to do anything yet with what the players do about it. If they choose to cross the place without touching the ray of light, the trap simply won't activate, no dice rolling required. I only have them roll reflex it if they do something that have their PC interact with the trigger in the right way.<br/><br/>(BTW, the trap described worked like this: there was a hole through the floor of the corridor and right before it, a ray of light illuminated the floor. if anyone stepped on the ray of light, a hatch on the corridor's ceiling right behind the players would open to drop a gelatinous cube. The first player didn't analyze the ray nor the corridor and jumped over the ray and the hole. He needed to roll for the jump, but even if he didn't had made it, the trap wouldn't have got activated. The next player walked straight to the border to jump from there, thus activating the trap. Since there wasn't any immediate danger to the player I just narrated how they heard a heavy noise behind them, but turn to see nothing. The player threw a torch to that side of the corridor, so I described how he saw it impact something, turn out with a hiss and remain floating in midair for a moment before starting to dissolve. Then the cube started to move towards them and became clearly visible)\n<blockquote><br/>Good system modeling of fictional variables serves, I think, to create a tension between immersion and utility.

Happy to talk more about this in another thread if you want, but for now my response is, "Nah."<br/></blockquote>\nHmm, yeah, had the same impression after a second glance at wildlings, but I dunno, I'd had to play it to give you a more objective analysis. Somebody up there who played it mentioned that once players have system mastery it works wonders, after I mentioned how counter-intuitive it feels. I think I'll give it a try or wait for the next game that uses a similar system.\n<blockquote>&gt;&gt;players quick on producing quality material close to the most representative reference material from that genre or atmosphere (somewhat harder to find/train but not impossible)&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the biggest issues I've faced in getting consistently satisfying play out of certain Story Games.

Because it is hard to argue for or against - because stories are something we not only enjoy logically, but also aesthetically and with feelings. I cannot argue why something is or is not a good story for someone, but i know when i have had my best or most consistent moments of story-making.<br/><br/>I think that story is an absolutely valid word. What i think differs to every single person and group is, what is a good story. <br/><br/>My weird guess would be that story is events/material reflected upon, brought together by any form of context: Some people like some material or events more than others. finding the right context of people, and creating a basis for a context that you are all invested in, will i guess, form a stronger base for the stories your group will like.<br/><br/>I think the reason why many people feel that a game does not create good stories is because not all the players were on the same page beforehand. I am not talking agenda, i am talking correlating the themes/genres/tropes.<br/><br/>But some people will not talk theme, nor can they understand it. That is totally fine, but people exist in different paradigms (for lack of better words). Some of these paradigms mesh better than others.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I have found nearly every game of swords without master creates profound stories - people either engage with the motifs, or are scared away by them. I have added them to one of my own games, And the same thing has happened! It is also true with ritual phrases a la Polaris,Archipelago and in the palette element from Microscope. <br/><br/>I did try to add all three things into a homebrew (ritual phrases, motifs, and palette) but guess what? The game stymied, stopped and died so fast. There was no creative struggling, and pulling, and riffing. <br/><br/>I did not test it through, but here is my qualified guess<br/>making great stories in the moment in games can be done <i>but there needs to be consensus</i><br/>but <i>not so much that there is not space for personal touch</i><br/>There needs to be away to give purpose to the additions of others, and build one them meanwhile. Building/not blocking at work here.

This is definitely true for me.  <br/><br/>I say "ironic" because of the amount of historical disagreement between proponents of "immersion" and proponents of "story".\n<blockquote>Why I'm bringing up this "story now" forgite thing? well, the term means something different to me now, like "we're making/playing this game to add literary value quicker into the game, so the process of making it into a better quality story in our minds is faster and needs less effort"<br/><br/>So, Story Games is still a perfectly applicable term; it certainly gives a common ground to a lot of games specialized in helping players produce -though play and practically in real time*- stories with elements of enough strength and quality to leave memorable moments printed in the minds of the players. Today these games have developed enough psychological/ communicational technology to help us bring to live content focused on different genres and variations/reinterpretations of those genres.</blockquote>There are definitely play-culture and design trends emphasizing these things you describe.  Where these overlap with Ron Edwards' definition of "Story Now", I hesitate to guess.<br/><br/>Trouble, though: I would say that play with "elements of enough strength and quality to leave memorable moments printed in the minds of the players" is a goal for people operating way outside any definition of "story gaming".  I mean, when I play a <i>board game</i>, I want quality moments that'll stick in my mind and tempt me to relate them, story-style, afterward!<br/><br/>I'm not trying to nit-pick your word choice; I think the fuzziness here is real.  When it comes to differentiating play on the "story" front, we can always choose a dividing line that sounds good in words, but matching it to actual play, our own and others, often seems to me like an act of will rather than mere observation.\n<blockquote>It took some alcohol, time and retelling the same stories a few times before we could come up with a good way of delivering the anecdotes . . . comparing it to, say, the Fiasco game Will Wheaton played on Tabletop, makes me believe that story games certainly excel at improving the quality of the material</blockquote>I agree that re-telling a completed game of Fiasco is way more intuitive than re-telling the thing that stuck with you about your dungeon crawl.  That doesn't necessarily say anything about which meant more to you, though.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that some players could generalize about which would likely mean more to them!

And that is what i meant: Different paradigms.<br/><br/>For some, good gameplay is exactly good stories. for others, it is bashing skulls with the largest dice, or positioning them for utmost efficiency in the fiction. Some people like to mix and match. (and that is why i think "powered by the apocalypse" has gained such a following, and when they added on damage dice in "dungeon world." well, they hit a third group - granting the possibility to mesh with a new arena of players at the cost of another.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Another cool thing. for some, a fictional event gains power as a story moment because the symbolical value imparted onto it by the mechanics. This is a shortened, generalized version of a group i heard talk about their game, roughly translated.<br/>"oh you remember when i bashed that trolls skull in with a f-n 12."<br/>"yeah whoosh, and of course, you also choose to inflict extra harm. It did cost your character an arm though..."<br/>"Yeah, but the blood mixed, and we slew them all. Troll-regeneration earned, and now the arm is growing out again!"<br/><br/>The twelve was very important. That die hitting the table is just as important in their story as the slaying of the troll. And for them, that story was worth <i>retelling</i> <i><b>over</b></i> and <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">over</span></i></b> in various permutations. For them, it was probably better than Hemmingway - and who am i to judge?<br/><br/>So to each their own. Story definitely has a role, but i think what constitutes a good story is completely fluid, near gaseous, differing in each group, and from each person in that group.<br/>---<br/><br/>I want to pseudo tie in reward structures.

"I rolled a 12 on a d12" is satisfying shorthand for, "I tried to bash the troll, and the fates were with me, as I landed an absolutely perfect blow!"  That's the story of the fiction.  Then we also have the story of the game play -- "I rolled really high at an opportune moment!" -- which I'd liken to stories about lucky rolls or draws in board games or card games.<br/><br/>My impression is that the conversation about "story in RPGs" is concerned with the former, but I dunno, perhaps I'm being narrow-minded there.\n<blockquote>I want to pseudo tie in reward structures.

I actually found out this almost by accident and haven't been able to reproduce it for other things.I wanted to try something similar to generate monster encounters, but haven't had the same sucess and didn't know why. And now you go and actually nail how it works! Thanks a lot, now I think I have a more proper approach into this!<br/><br/>Well, for the particular of a smart enemy with human senses, the list of triggers would be somewhat short: sight, noise, smell... then it starts to become situational, like light (if in darkness), vibration (like, if they are approaching in horses), disturbing other creatures (like birds, if present). You can introduce degrees, like only loud noises or unmasked smells, etc. So, maybe this list of triggers wouldn't work too well unless you're totally unprepared and winging the session, since the trigger will define a bit of what kind of opponents you're facing and in what state they are.<br/><br/>Next the list of responses would do the same. For that you may better list more specific reactions based on the weapons and number of opponents:<br/><br/>-Hides until they are gone/close<br/>-Runs away<br/>-Calls for help<br/>-Enemy charges against the group<br/>-Attacks from above<br/>-Takes a deffensive position<br/>-A hail of arrows is shoot against the PCs<br/>-Enemy jumps from nowhere into the group<br/>-poisoned darts are shoot against the PCs<br/>-The (apparently) weakest PC is targeted first<br/>-Something is used to split the party<br/>-A distraction is used against the PCs<br/>-The  transportation/legs of the PCs are targeted first<br/>-A powerful weapon/area attack is used against the group<br/>-Enemy makes intimidating noises before showing themselves<br/>-Enemy runs to lure the PCs somewhere<br/><br/>Also, you could mix two or more of these responses to get even better and more complex tactical reactions, like an enemy who first runs away calling for help, but then it turns is a trap to get all PCs in one place to shoot arrows at them or use an area attack over them.<br/>I kinda like the responses better, since for the triggers I'm usually more intuitive.\n<blockquote><br/>Not sure about your "complications scaling and resolving" point, though.  Feel free to elaborate!<br/></blockquote>\nmy bad, I meant like, when players face a problem, complications become worse (I used "scaling" instead of "escalate") and then at some point get resolved.\n<blockquote>Are Prepare, Hide, Analyze, and Attack official moves with die rolls?  Just trying to get a sense of the full system here, to add to your other descriptions.<br/></blockquote> Certainly, they are official moves in my mind, though I've never explained them to players as such. I do give them as suggestions to players when they look like they don't have a clue about what to do (as this is probably my fault for not describing enough/being confuse or even being so vivid in my description that they are imagining the scene instead of thinking how to react to it). But that's it; perhaps I should try to make this more explicit in the rules, though I'd have to see others GMing my game RAW to be sure.<br/><br/>I certainly don't plan to go that AW with my system anyway; I'm keeping a single GM move: whenever players want to try something difficult, they roll 2d6 and add their skill bonus. On a 2 something bad threats EVERYONE. On a low roll only the PC faces a threat, on a high roll they suceed and on a 12+ an opportunity arises for whoever can take it (like, the enemy in now prone and the next player who attacks has advantage, or does more damage, etc.<br/><br/>I also inform the players on how much time they have until they have to face another consequence, if they are taking too much time to decide or if they want to do something too complex/time consuming. Hmm, now you got me thinking that I should formalize more of these as GM rules/moves.\n<blockquote>Cool.  Sounds like we mostly handle this pretty much the same way.

I'd really like to see a formalization of that as a GM rule. I'm used to trad systems that ask for this "perception roll". Good part is simulation, characters with better senses distinguish themselves and makes their players shine on those occassions, but I hate when the scene depends on these rolls and too many players get poor chances of success on these because of mechanical "race limitations" or their choice of min-maxing.<br/><br/>So I disregard these rolls when the level of roleplayed inquiry is right. If players ask the right questions or take the proper approach I go straight into describing how the world reacts, because then it's like a character drawing a weapon or opening a door, it's definitely something that doesn't require a roll. That's also one of the main reasons why I ask players "how do you do that?" and make suggestions/examples/questions to get their descriptions right.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if players don't describe too much or describe a kind of careless approach, I  have them roll perception as a safeguard. I find it fair because "the character may have noticed something that the player may not" given that not always players imagine the situation from the PCs point of view, nor take notice or interpretate right every single bit of information the GM gives about the shared world. The "no metagaming" part of the social contract usually does the rest. If the player fails the perception roll they know something is ahead but they can't react to it or change their current course of action. If they still do, I ask them for a good reason to and call them on to stop metagaming if their excuse is bad.\n<blockquote>Nice!  Thinking from the player characters' point of view, what can they see and hear, etc.  I do this too.</blockquote>\nYou mean, isn't this a usual way to play everywhere? I learned to play this way since my first days in the hobby, but I'd believe you if you told me that not enough people play this way.

It doesn't seem to have to do much with the rules at first; perhaps is just regular players being nervous about the camera or whatever. But then I think: okey, if you have a slow system or just not enough mastery to play it fast, wouldn't that eventually determine your pacing for playing every RPG?<br/><br/>It's like, when my group plays, it's normal speed for me but compared to most of those videos, we would be described as hectic. GMs description on the videos go like "Ammm... you are in this... (aimlessly plays with notes)... (takes an eternity to point at something with their pencil)... (looks up to the players to see if they are still following him)... you're in this road to... (quickly checks his notes) Aryon. Right, Aryon. It's... I'd say six o'clock and it's... you know, getting darker..." And I'm like "Man, if that was my group we would be in Aryon half an hour ago, after a suspenseful and frustratingly long random encounter with half a dozen kobolds on the road"<br/><br/>So, what I mean is that, if you gey used to play the game in slow-mo from the start, even with system mastery, wouldn't you get used to that pacing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451323/#Comment_451323" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-14T11:48:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2016 11:48AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Steve, heh heh heh... do you seek certain types of decisions just because they're fun in the moment, or also because they'll make for good stories afterward?

It spared the life of the dead man's comrades, by causing them to flee in fear. Like the peacock's tail as a courtship symbol, it emphasises the built-in redundancy in Riddick's fighting capacity.<br/><br/>Your decision to limit yourself to fighting honourably, attacking from the front in melee, and avoid the use of ranged weaponry or sneak attacks, writes large a world view of a very particular character.<br/><br/>The willingness to use poison to give your foe a slow death even if he slays you, speaks to a mind filled with revenge.<br/><br/>When your allies are threatened, do you hide behind your shield, in a defensive position in a narrow pass, hoping to hold out for reinforcements to arrive while your allies die all around you? Or do you wade into the melee with dirk and rapier, increasing the risk to your life, for a small chance of saving your friends?<br/><br/>Perhaps your allies offer you a brand new Colt, but you stick with your old shotgun Bessie, who has served you well and true this past score of years or more. Because you are a simple man of traditional values, perhaps a stick-in-the-mud.<br/><br/>Are you the man who brings a knife to a gunfight, or the man who brings a gun to a knife-fight? Do you fight back-to-back with a companion you barely trust, forced by circumstances, or do you fight with your back against the wall, showing that your heart is closed to this new companion? Do you hang back and let others take the risks, or jump in and go for the glory? Do you support others in combat and allow them to look like heroes, or like Legolas and Gimli, is the battle a competition with your ally?<br/><br/>To say that there is no "story" in combat tactics is nothing but untested preconceptions. And then quite apart from the drama in combat tactics from an abstract perspective, there is also the impact on the participants in the game of knowing that every little choice and every little detail can matter; this not only feels more "real", but also keeps everyone on their toes. No lazily waiting to win a dice-contest before you can declare your tactics and weaponry to suit the occasion; you must pay attention to the little details of the fiction, so that you can make good choices, and though you do so perhaps for tactical ends, you end up all being on the same page about what all those little details are, which helps you to cooperate to tell a story together.<br/><br/>I have sat through far many belaboured exercises in figurine-positioning, dice-rolling and the exploitation of attacks of opportunity to doubt that tacticality can, in some circumstances, drain the blood from the fiction. But this supposed dichotomy between tactical games where nothing resembling "story" can exist and "story" games where nothing resembling tactics can exist - is a conceptual impossibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451388/#Comment_451388" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-16T17:28:53+00:00" title="February 16, 2016  5:28PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Youre describing a tactical combat game I guess, if how you describe an attack is a significant decision.

It happened in our session. Because of things like this, the GM started to trust me more and let me go with more freedom when applying the rules into my descriptions. Later in the game I dismissed a climbing roll and reduced the time between two scenes by stating "I use <i>Leap of Heavens</i>". We were playing Pathfinder, the Leap is from 3.5. The actual monk class feature is <i>High Jump</i>, which only gives you your level as a bonus to acrobatics checks. I should have still made the roll but the GM let me go with it because monk.<br/><br/>Later on the same campaign, we faced a couple of wyverns on one side and a big group of undeads on the other. The GM let me jump oven one of the wyverns, grapple it and use it's breath weapon to deal with the zombie group. I still had to made the rolls but there's no such rule that allows you to do that in PF, it was all the GMs doing, because he wanted to see that scene too.<br/><br/>He was nice enough to give us all what we wanted though, the fighter used his pumped up AC and attack bonuses to behead the other wyvern, all rules-wise way, because that was the player's deal.<br/><br/>So, it's not like you have to always bend or break the rules to have good story moments, but you will be prone to do so to get a particular flavor if it's unusual for the system you're playing with. You can always say, "hey, if we're going to play that way, why not transfer this campaign to some system that handles wuxia better?" but most of the times players would answer "no, it's ok that way" especially if only one or two players are doing all the anime moves and are happy enough with just some rule-bending here and there.<br/><br/>So what, it's still moves and color, right? you're right, but notice how this color added by the player slowly pushes the group into changing the game theme. Since the GM let this happen and it went good, soon other players want to join in the same kind of fun. The same goes if somebody tries slapstick comedy and the resultant scene is so hilarious that everyone wants more. Of course, it's not like it will be the same thing every session, but players (and the GM) will remember whatever they liked and try to bring it back sometime, either in the combat, roleplaying, descriptions or why not, story choices themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451456/#Comment_451456" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-19T23:52:08+00:00" title="February 19, 2016 11:52PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2016 12:00AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So I think . . . you want to be making the types of decisions that characters in good stories make.</blockquote>I agree, that's a great place to look for merging art/entertainment preference with gameplay preference.

</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Youre describing a tactical combat game I guess, if how you describe an attack is a significant decision.  I dont see how the nature of an attack could have any real significance in a story apart from colour.  special effects, if you like.<br/><br/>The significant decision, story-wise, could be 'should I fight this guy?'   Drama is associated with high stakes so presumably something your character cares a lot about about is going to happen either way if he fights or chooses not to fight.  </blockquote>\nThe choices you make in combat speak about you as a person.<br/><br/>Riddick's decision to kill a man with a teacup is a display of dominance that builds up his image as an unstoppable force. It spared the life of the dead man's comrades, by causing them to flee in fear. Like the peacock's tail as a courtship symbol, it emphasises the built-in redundancy in Riddick's fighting capacity.<br/><br/>Your decision to limit yourself to fighting honourably, attacking from the front in melee, and avoid the use of ranged weaponry or sneak attacks, writes large a world view of a very particular character.<br/><br/>The willingness to use poison to give your foe a slow death even if he slays you, speaks to a mind filled with revenge.<br/><br/>When your allies are threatened, do you hide behind your shield, in a defensive position in a narrow pass, hoping to hold out for reinforcements to arrive while your allies die all around you? Or do you wade into the melee with dirk and rapier, increasing the risk to your life, for a small chance of saving your friends?<br/><br/>Perhaps your allies offer you a brand new Colt, but you stick with your old shotgun Bessie, who has served you well and true this past score of years or more. Because you are a simple man of traditional values, perhaps a stick-in-the-mud.<br/><br/>Are you the man who brings a knife to a gunfight, or the man who brings a gun to a knife-fight? Do you fight back-to-back with a companion you barely trust, forced by circumstances, or do you fight with your back against the wall, showing that your heart is closed to this new companion? Do you hang back and let others take the risks, or jump in and go for the glory? Do you support others in combat and allow them to look like heroes, or like Legolas and Gimli, is the battle a competition with your ally?<br/><br/>To say that there is no "story" in combat tactics is nothing but untested preconceptions. And then quite apart from the drama in combat tactics from an abstract perspective, there is also the impact on the participants in the game of knowing that every little choice and every little detail can matter; this not only feels more "real", but also keeps everyone on their toes. No lazily waiting to win a dice-contest before you can declare your tactics and weaponry to suit the occasion; you must pay attention to the little details of the fiction, so that you can make good choices, and though you do so perhaps for tactical ends, you end up all being on the same page about what all those little details are, which helps you to cooperate to tell a story together.<br/><br/>I have sat through far many belaboured exercises in figurine-positioning, dice-rolling and the exploitation of attacks of opportunity to doubt that tacticality can, in some circumstances, drain the blood from the fiction. But this supposed dichotomy between tactical games where nothing resembling "story" can exist and "story" games where nothing resembling tactics can exist - is a conceptual impossibility.</blockquote>\n"The choices you make in combat speak about you as a person."<br/><br/>Ok, but demonstrating character isnt a significant decision.  Riddicks teacup - there was nothing riding on his weapon choice.  He was never in any danger from a bunch of witless thugs.<br/><br/>Similarly, whether Fred packs a knife or gun demonstrates his character, but in the absence of any other context, the choice is tactical in nature because the consequences are tactical in nature.  <br/><br/>"When your allies are threatened, do you hide behind your shield, in a defensive position in a narrow pass, hoping to hold out for reinforcements to arrive while your allies die all around you? Or do you wade into the melee with dirk and rapier, increasing the risk to your life, for a small chance of saving your friends?"<br/><br/>This is a great significant decision, but its not about tactics its about putting your life ahead of others or vice versa.  Shields, narrow passes, dirks and rapiers are just colour as far as the nature of that decision.  <br/><br/>Demonstrating character is great.  Colour is cool and fun.  Stories have characterization and colour.   But if you want to know what the game/story is really about, then examine the nature of the significant decisions being made in it.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451497/#Comment_451497" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T16:14:29+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  4:14PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was riding on Riddick's weapon choice was the life of the thugs he scared off; if he'd used a gun, the 2nd thug might have still wanted a go after he killed the first, because the 2nd thug might have thought it was just a lucky shot.<br/><br/>Regarding the narrow pass, the narrow pass, the shield, the dirk and the rapier are what present the choice and mould its contours. They are far from being just colour. You are not making a decision in a situation of perfect transparency of information. You are juggling uncertainties and probabilities as well as priorities.

You may love your friends' lives above your own but not enough to change your chance of dying from 50% to 95% for the sake of improving their chance of living from 0% to 1%. You may hardly care about your allies but decide that shifting the odds of you dying from 50% to 51% is worthwhile if it improves their chance of living from 1% to 95% and their chance of being your grateful puppets forever from 0% to 50%. If the extra danger is slim, it may be worth it for the thrill. If it is nuclear, that may just make it more thrilling. At the end of the day it's a big, glorious, dirty mess that you're swimming around in, not something that you're standing over with authorial control... unless the mechanics dictate that metagame factors alone dictate the outcome of the scenario.

They dictate not just the flavour of the arena where you do battle with your dilemmas, but the whole nature of that battle, because they are part of the information flow, and every detail of "fluff" potentially impacts on the mechanics at some level, through Rule 0, through table consensus or whatever.

So looking at this messy situation you have presented as an example, and searching for the story in it - lets pretend its a TV show instead.  "die to save my friends, or live and watch them die" is the story thing that is going down.  It provides the context that gives the fight meaning.  Otherwise its just - enemies are attacking, fight! Rinse and repeat as many times as you like.  We all know that the protagonists lives arent really in danger, in an RPG or a TV show.  There is a nod and a wink where no matter how badly someone is defeated in battle, the PCs dont kick the bucket.   And rightly so.  <br/><br/>So the role of story in a game can be buried beneath dirks, and shields and damage rolls and a zillion other tactical factors, or it can be highlighted in sharp relief by diminishing those factors.  Where you are on this particular spectrum will be a factor of the game you are playing and the players, obviously.<br/><br/>"Very rarely do you have a straight, neat choice where all the consequences are neon-signposted for you.......At the end of the day it's a big, glorious, dirty mess that you're swimming around in, not something that you're standing over with authorial control... unless the mechanics dictate that metagame factors alone dictate the outcome of the scenario"<br/><br/>This does not have to be the case at all.  There is nothing inherently metagame about identifying and highlighting the significant story decisions in a game.  Its just the nature of the decision that is being made is different from, lets say, a tactical decision.  Its all about how you frame a situation and resolve it.  Im sure you can imagine two very different ways to frame your example situation and rules for resolving it at different ends of the 'story highlighted &lt;===&gt; tactical minutia highlighted' spectrum. neither of which involve metagame/story-boarding.<br/><br/>As an aside, you would hope that if the game and players are highlighting dirks and shields and tactical factors as significant in a game, that there is a great tactical ruleset at the basis of it.  Such as D&amp;D 3.5.  What a lovely game of tactical fighting it is!   <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451538/#Comment_451538" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T07:19:46+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  7:19AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think we can generalize about <i>how significant</i> various character-expressing choices are.

Perhaps 'consequential' is a better term.  i.e. the decision feeds back into the game and affects how the rest of the game plays out.  That shouldnt be subjective, it either does or it doesnt.  As a player at the table you will be able to judge for yourself which decisions were consequential and which were not, after the fact.  <br/><br/>It might help to think of the consequences of a decision as having a scope.  At one end of the spectrum the scope of the consequences might be entirely within the immediate scene.  At the other end, they might turn the entire game upside down from this point forward.  <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451541/#Comment_451541" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T09:05:30+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  9:05AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2016 9:35AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So if I express my character in a certain way -- choosing to intimidate rather than slay, for instance -- and the group is all like, "Woo, that's interesting!

But with the context you have added, then sure!  Thats way more grist for story than "do I do a flying dragon kick or a rolling walrus punch?"   The walking dead writers are having a bit of fun with Carol vs. Morgan in a similar vein.  Its the choices those characters are making - to kill or not to kill - that is the meat.  The weapons they are shown when implementing  their decisions are just props.  Having decided to intimidate rather than slaughter, 'my left pinky finger' serves just as well as 'this teacup' .  <br/><br/>As you say, you have to be open to it.  If you say 'My guy is going to kill this guy with a teapcup to intimidate the rest of the thugs' and your GM says 'OK, a teacup only does 1 point of damage and Im giving you a -70% chance to hit because its not trained weapon'  its going to be a major bummer, story-wise.  Youre treating the decision as being story significant and the GM is treating it as being tactically significant.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451557/#Comment_451557" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T19:38:37+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  7:38PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha ha ha!

The player misses noticing the teacup threat or takes it just as color, thinking Riddick is gonna call for help or activate some trap, or maybe just bluffing. The GM may fail to notice the player said before "I check what are the other's inmates doing before going to ambush Riddick", or didn't take it as "I make sure nobody is going to try help him/stop us"<br/><br/>So, both things lead us to the scene where Riddick kills one PC who misread the threat level.<br/><br/>Intention is trickier, or perhaps just dirtier: either the player or the GM may choose to intentionally interpretate things in their favor. If you are facing an NPC who threats your character with a teacup, does it make sense to run away? Shouldn't the GM had given you more clues? Ok, maybe he asked for a wisdom roll to asess the threat, maybe roll to see if you've heard of him, but you failed. Does that gives him the right to kill your PC just for not knowing? You can claim on things like this to call shenanigans on the GM for using overpowered NPCs without warning the players, if you happen to see no other way to survive the encounter or avoid railroading than metagaming your way out of it.<br/><br/>I've also seen GMs intentionally taking things just as color instead of actual game choices, just because taking them as such ruins their fun somehow. They do so expecting players won't notice, and most of the time they get away with it, because players were too subtle or didn't notice their reaction actually ruined the GM's plan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451570/#Comment_451570" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T23:22:10+00:00" title="February 22, 2016 11:22PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That line is quite blurry, I was thinking that player perception/intention and GM perception/intention may have an impact on how much color becomes choices and how much stays as color. <br/><br/>The perception part is easy: let's say you're the ones facing Riddick and his teacup.

You can claim on things like this to call shenanigans on the GM for using overpowered NPCs without warning the players, if you happen to see no other way to survive the encounter or avoid railroading than metagaming your way out of it.<br/><br/>I've also seen GMs intentionally taking things just as color instead of actual game choices, just because taking them as such ruins their fun somehow. They do so expecting players won't notice, and most of the time they get away with it, because players were too subtle or didn't notice their reaction actually ruined the GM's plan.</blockquote>\nThis is from this:  <a href="http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/protagonism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/protagonism</a><br/><br/>"The Architecture of Protagonism<br/>Traditional role-playing games fail consistently as engines of story creation from their relentless doubting of the protagonism of the player characters. A character can generally suffer an ignominious demise at any turn. No author of fiction would be so cavalier. And so neither is My Life with Master. Antagonism in traditional games is merely a continuous questioning of the survival and thematic credibility of the player character. No author of fiction would be so self-defeating of his storytelling effort. "<br/><br/>To doubt that a PC might assess the teacup situation with anything less than full awareness of all the implications would be a pointless, unfun for everybody, counter productive waste of time.  To kill off a protagonist for no good reason (uh, sorry dude, he rolled a critical) is just ludicrous for most RPG agendas.  <br/><br/>Would you even bother picking up the dice for this scene at all?  It would depend on the context - how important is whats going down to the PCs?  In other words does the character facing Riddick have anything important at stake, one way or the other?  If not, then dont bother.  The scene becomes just a cool, colourful underlining that Riddick is either an unstoppable martial force as he easily *incapacitates* a PC with teacup, or a thoroughly intimidating bastard, if the PC decides to back down.<br/><br/>If the PC cares, however, if they have something at stake, then by all means play out the fight with dice.  Perhaps the PC's credibility or confidence is at stake?  It doesnt really matter what the stakes are, as long as the player signals to the GM that 'hey, this is important to my guy'.  I have no problem with that signal being explicit, although hopefully if the GM is familiar with his PCs, it would be obvious after a while - hey, backing down to Riddick like this is gong to be a major issue for Fred's character....this is going to be good!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451578/#Comment_451578" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T02:18:51+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  2:18AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a common unspoken stake in most "be someone cool" roleplay which is, "Do I in fact come off as cool?"<br/><br/>This is big in my White Wolf experience.

It became a "sign of being hip" to design your games without explicit stake-setting.<br/><br/>And yet, this is precisely where such resolution techniques shine:<br/><br/>Explicit stake-setting forces the group to align themselves very quickly on this issue, and then gives them the tools to do so. <br/><br/>(-"No, hang on.

I'm working my way through the thread, only on page 1/4 so far, so forgive me if this is backtracking.<br/><br/>As others have said, I think you can look back after the conclusion of a gaming session and find (if you look hard enough) what amounts to some semblance of a "story," but I don't think creating coherent stories is an inherent part of gaming. At least, not most gaming. <br/><br/>Sure, some games are designed to create stories through play, quite a few have been mentioned, such as PTA and Fiasco. But those lack something fundamental to satisfying stories: unity of purpose. <br/><br/>Even games designed around telling stories hit dead ends and narrative cul-de-sacs that most "real" stories simply wouldn't have. They'd be rewritten or edited out. Up to a point, things like meta-currency can help with that problem. By retconning a scene or changing a poorly timed bad roll that would wreck a story. <br/><br/>And that speaks to something of the problem with trying to make games that directly create stories. I'll get back to that, but first there's a game that hasn't been mentioned that really should...<br/><br/>Look at one example that surprisingly hasn't been mentioned yet: Trail of Cthulhu. It was specifically designed around a fairly common problem with its parent game: the missing of clues essential to the continuation of the story because of bad rolls. So ToC fixed that by simply removing the randomness of <i>whether</i> a clue would be found, and made the game work by more closely mirroring the fiction it was striving to emulate... the characters in detective fiction don't fail to find clues, nor do they fail to use their lab equipment, rather it's how those clues are interpreted by the characters that drives the story. <br/><br/>It's an interesting example because it did the one thing a game probably shouldn't do... it removed the <i>game element</i> (i.e. the randomness) from the game so that it could more closely capture the fiction it was trying to emulate.<br/><br/>To me, that sums up the problem of trying to make games that directly create stories. The more inherently "story-like" it becomes, the less "game-like" it will have to be. Everything that a game is, randomness, chance, player and/or character choices mattering, etc are all basically diametrically opposed to satisfying stories. <br/><br/>Stories work in a very particular way that's basically not gameable, at least not in a way that would be satisfying to most gamers. Everything about most satisfying stories (TV, film, comics, etc) is strictly regimented and samey. Acts, act breaks, character arcs, B stories that are thematically linked, plot twists at just the right times, minor success being the ball in a tennis match (one side wins a little then the other side wins a little... over and over and over), lasting success only at the right time, etc. <br/><br/>That kind of sameness is enjoyable when it's done by extremely talented TV and film writers, performed by actors who know their roles inside and out, and are wrapped up in 22-minutes to 2 hours, tops. But that same things as a sprawling beer and pretzels gaming session that lasts anywhere from 4-7 hours or more? <br/><br/>Fiasco pulls this off (sort of) by only having two acts and it being about the utter chaos of a certain genre of films. PTA pulls this off by being about any TV show, but it's more like a collaborative writing system than a game in many ways. Not knocking either, they're great fun, but nearly everything about "game" seems to be largely going in the opposite direction from "story".                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451589/#Comment_451589" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T05:54:06+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  5:54AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>, I don't agree with you on what a game <i>must</i> be or what a satisfying story <i>must</i> be, but I do agree with your point that there's usually a tension between the two.<br/><br/>The Gumshoe system (ToC and others) is a great example!  I see Trail of Cthulhu as a sort of middle ground between traditional Call of Cthulhu roleplay (which gamifies some things and not others), Lovecraft fiction, and detective fiction in general.  In my opinion, the CoC game bit that ToC ditched -- "see whether or not you find clues" -- added nothing to CoC in any sense, and its removal is more about fun of any sort trumping shitty gameplay than story trumping good gameplay.  (I'm not saying clue-seeking in CoC couldn't be fun via GM-player interaction, but it certainly wasn't fun purely via mechanics.)  Note that ToC kept CoC's core reward system, the Sanity mechanics, which are arguably supportive of both gaming <i>and</i> familiar story-creation.<br/><br/>Perhaps an even better example than Sanity (which may or may not be "gameable" at all, depending on the sanity-draining situations the GM uses) is Tension from Dead of Night.  Tension is a number that certain game actions increase and other actions reduce, and when it rises above certain thresholds, things get creepier and more urgent and more deadly, and ultimately it maxes out and the game ends shortly thereafter.  So, basically, it mandates the arc of the B horror films it emulates, and provides some interesting game choices that regulate the specifics within that arc.  Just as you pointed out with Fiasco, this sort of simple modeling is only possible because of the particular type of story being modeled.  Still, I think it's an interesting combo of gameplay and genre tale-crafting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451590/#Comment_451590" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T06:03:14+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  6:03AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On Riddick's Teacup:<br/><br/>I'm not interested in the movie, I just latched onto the example as the sort of thing a player might do with their character in an RPG for expressive reasons.<br/><br/>It's easy to imagine how it could be mere color, but it's also easy for me to imagine how it could be the most consequential, high-stakes choice in the game.<br/><br/>Personally, if I were going to play a game where you try to seem awesome, and seeming awesome is not guaranteed, and lots of consequences flow out of whether you do or don't pull it off, I think I'd prefer a system which handles impression-making specifically, rather than "whatever you care about" generally.

For instance: even as we speak, there are a great number of extremely popular television shows which specifically break those conventions. And I would argue that they are popular in part precisely <i>because</i> they break those conventions.<br/><br/>In the field of film and literature, likewise, there are many influential and respected figures (fans, critics, and creators/authors) who believe that the best stories are most definitely not "strictly regimented and samey". They say that surprise, development, evolution is what we need, that breaking our expectations is at the root of great art (or even just great entertainment).<br/><br/>This is a fundamental debate in the arts, and to say that only one side of it is relevant here seems strange to me. Unpredictability, surprise, novelty - all of these can be highly important aspects of storytelling.<br/><br/>However, even if we <i>are</i> just talking about regimented, formulaic stories, it's still entirely possible to construct games where the players' challenge is precisely to create those formulae or to re-enact those plots. And what's wrong with that?<br/><br/>As gamers, we have an advantage in that even relatively unexciting stories can feel powerful and moving and memorable because we had a hand in creating them ourselves and participating in them. We do not necessarily need perfection of form!

So, basically, it mandates the arc of the B horror films it emulates, and provides some interesting game choices that regulate the specifics within that arc.  Just as you pointed out with Fiasco, this sort of simple modeling is only possible because of the particular type of story being modeled.

A character can generally suffer an ignominious demise at any turn. No author of fiction would be so cavalier. And so neither is My Life with Master. Antagonism in traditional games is merely a continuous questioning of the survival and thematic credibility of the player character. No author of fiction would be so self-defeating of his storytelling effort. "<br/><br/>To doubt that a PC might assess the teacup situation with anything less than full awareness of all the implications would be a pointless, unfun for everybody, counter productive waste of time.  To kill off a protagonist for no good reason (uh, sorry dude, he rolled a critical) is just ludicrous for most RPG agendas.</blockquote>\nExactly, you're right about how most games go. GMs and players ignore and misinterpretate the PC awareness both accidentally an intentionally. But, is that because of how trad systems work? I'm not so sure. Or well, I know for sure the system can do a great deal of that part better with a simple change.<br/><br/>I'm currently GMing my games this way and I'm consistently getting better results, story-wise. Next time you GM, you could try it out. It may require a bit of effort at first because of the many, many years we've been playing other wise, but the results are deffinitely worth the effort. This is the deal:<i> whenever a player fails a roll, don't describe it as "you miss"</i>. That's the part where the story becomes boring; it takes several minutes to frame and run a single player's turn, if in that turn nothing is happening, it's time wasted. Yes, the system could be adjusted to make something happen, but it isn't  necessary, all you have to adjust is your interpretation of the dice.<br/><br/><b>What you have to describe instead is how the PC is about to make it, but then something unexpected happens</b>. The ork blocks your arrow with a sudden movement of his sword. You make a feint and then attack as your opponent regains balance, but you hit the air when the deranged cultist choses to fall to the ground and roll back instead. It makes a world of a difference. As a player, I've never been able to take well complicated and humiliating descriptions of how my PC fails. Yes, I'll laugh with the group, but then I'll most probably take revenge on something else the GM holds dear (like his railroad) whenever I get the chance. So, by recognizing the PCs protagonism in this way, you not only  help build player's confidence; you're recognizing them as <i>cool people</i> through their characters, and on top you can make your NPCs and monsters look cooler, even if you don't get to roll a critical through all the campaign.<br/><br/>(The idea isn't mine of course, though now I can't remember from where I picked it up)<br/><br/>There's also prepping events ahead from the consequences of player's choices. Ok, players decide to start a brawl al the tavern and nothing much gets done in the session, everyone has a laugh except maybe the GM because he had to throw away his prep for this session.<br/><br/>Ok, what if for the next session, you used whatever happened in the tavern to create an event for the next session? Now it feels as if player's choices do matter, and nothing they do is inconsequential. And believe me, that usually keeps players from starting tavern brawls without thinking it twice.<br/><br/>The thing is, trad games didn't taught me to humilliate my players, bad GMs did. Systems could point me to this before anyway, but that doesn't totally make systems the problem.<br/><br/>Also, I started <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20553/immersionist-gm-practices" rel="nofollow">another thread</a> about most of this, since David asked for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451617/#Comment_451617" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T23:02:16+00:00" title="February 23, 2016 11:02PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2016 11:13PM by stefoid.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Exactly, you're right about how most games go.

Whatever a PC says they want to do, let them do it.  ie.  Instead of giving them a list of tasks they must execute successfully in order for their intention to come true, just have them describe, in detail ,how they intend to make it come true, and .. that happens!  **<br/><br/>** well, not quite.  Your job as GM is to come up with complications and consequences.  "The best laid plans of mice and men..."  As they state the things they want to happen, on the path to achieving their goal, you agree - that step does happen - BUT you are looking for angles- unintended side effects or consequences of that thing happening that cause complications.  "Ok, you do that, and because you did that - this happens"<br/><br/>good complications:<br/>- are a result of PC activity, either now or in the past<br/>- are plausible consequences of PC activity<br/>- force the player to make decisions in order to proceed<br/>- dont block or rewind the story<br/><br/>poor complications:<br/>- are random events<br/>- are highly unlikely <br/>- stop the PCs in their tracks, or give them no options about how they can deal with the complication.<br/><br/>You dont have to complicate every single thing that happens, just when you think of something good and appropriate, and always with an eye to 'how important is this current situation to my PCs big goals?'<br/><br/>This stops the 'doubting of the PC protaganism' - it shifts the emphasis from 'can the PC do this?' to 'should the PC do this?' and 'what will happen if the PC does this?'   Thats got to help the story along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451620/#Comment_451620" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-24T15:08:39+00:00" title="February 24, 2016  3:08PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2016 7:20PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda thought Old School meant that, at least as it was explained to me by 2e players here.

But uncertainty should be a spice, not the meat?<br/><br/>If you wanted to make this exercise slightly more usable, I would involve character goals.<br/><br/>i.e.  How granular do you make these player intentions?  At one end is "I hit him with my sword" and at the other is "I kill him".    Another way of saying that is how closely are we looking at this current situation.  Obviously if the situation is not very important, you can stand back and the PCs can make "larger" intentions such as "I kill him".  If the situation is quite important then we can examine it closely - the PCs can make more granular intentions such as "I strike him".  The GM tailors the scope of the consequences to the scope of the action for the most part.<br/><br/>The measure of importance can simply be, how close is the current situation to immediately resolving any of the PCs goals?  IF not so close, stand back, if very close examine closely.<br/><br/>One last thing - capability - The players must make plausible intentions for their characters capability.  That doesnt mean the GM is a fascist about it though - only veto absolutely obviously implausible intentions.  However, as a rule of thumb, if the character is kind of incompetent in skills required to execute an intention, the degree of the complication can be proportionately worse.  <br/><br/>i.e. if, in a situation of not very much importance to a character goal. a skilled warrior character says "I kill the thug", then bammo it just happens without too much ado.  However if a librarian says "I kill the thug" then (a) the player needs to go into some detail about how that is even plausible (perhaps a distraction etc...?) and (b) things could get complicated in a bad way - OK, you distract the thug and smash him over the head with the lamp, but he doesnt go down, there is a struggle in which you take several bad hits before you manage to beat him to death with repeated blows with the lamp - you have a badly broken nose, missing a tooth and are covered in blood.<br/><br/>I would not add any more complexity to this exercise other than that though, or the purpose of the exercise starts to get obscured beneath cruft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451638/#Comment_451638" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-24T23:01:18+00:00" title="February 24, 2016 11:01PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last word on character goals - good goals have stakes that are important to that character.  i.e. if the goal is achieved, or not, something significant happens for that character, either way.  Even if that something is only the character feels very good or very bad about the outcome.<br/><br/>Poor goals are those with relatively 'meh' stakes where if the goal is or isnt achieved, then its no big deal really.  Dont bother stating those types of goals, or examining them closely.  They can be covered, if they need to be, by standing back and just saying "I do this".

But uncertainty should be a spice, not the meat?<br/></blockquote>\nNo, uncertainty is a spice, all right, but the dice do more than that. Whenever the GM says "roll the dice" that (technique) is a cue to stop discussing how the scene goes and resolve the conflict, otherwise discussions about the nature of the conflict and variables involved have the potential of growing out of control and proportion, stealing gametime and even ruining immersion.<br/><br/>You would need to include a similar technique to cut the discussion. The thing about dice or any other systems that uses numbers or luck is that it make the brain change gears into mathematics/eye-hand control skills, engaging the other side of your brain. It's this small shock the one that makes possible to stop the verbal argumentation and force the players to take a different approach to the game.<br/><br/>While keeping things into the verbal reasoning field is perfectly possible, as the emotions become more intense through feedback between players, achieving Flow, the risk of players getting into this kind of arguments rises. Even if the game isn't exactly competitive, tension will search for the weakest point to break free, which to me now would be the control of the creative agenda, if we're stripping the game of everithing else.<br/><br/>I admit that that last pharagraph would be an extreme case, but I'm way too used to find these kind of extreme cases in real life. With the right group of players, with everyone in the same page, about goals and limits, it's perfectly possible and it would be tons of fun as it could be really immersive. Alas, not with my group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451657/#Comment_451657" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T17:29:07+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  5:29PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are many other uses of dice (randomizers), as well. One I'm particularly fond of is how players assess risk. You may be willing to agree to a heavy consequence, penalty, or repercussion, but will refuse more dangerous/severe consequences, because of their weight. <br/><br/>However, when the brain is considering a gamble, decisions are made differently. First of all, this can help reach agreement: agreeing on a *probability* is almost always less socially-fraught than agreeing on an outcome. Second, people are more willing to accept extreme outcomes if there's a chance of avoiding them, so (given the right design) adding a random can increase the overall stakes your players are willing to play for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20438/the-role-of-story-in-rpgs/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20438/the-role-of-story-in-rpgs">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20438/the-role-of-story-in-rpgs/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20438/the-role-of-story-in-rpgs/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20438/the-role-of-story-in-rpgs/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20438%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20438%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
