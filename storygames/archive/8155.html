I played the Vampire: Bloodlines PC game again recently, which drove me to want to play the tabletop RPG asap.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's a lot of supplements for it out already, so I was wondering what say 2-3 books in the line really worth having would be, and why. The corebook is an interesting, fitting read, and I'm looking for stuff that really expands on it. Not so much "splatbookish" ("here's more background info on Bloodline X"), but useful as a GM ("here's great imminently usable campaign fodder about Bloodline X", "here's a cool campaign setting with stuff ripe to use", etc).<br/><br/>I'll probably be running it in 2-3 months, so I have time to read up on it in the interim before I draft up the situation for play.<br/><br/>Recommendations?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179499/#Comment_179499" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T12:33:56+00:00" title="November 20, 2008 12:33PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Coteries book was pretty cool in that it talked about the basic unit of vampiric organization and gave you all sorts of ideas for what coteries could do, what roles they could play, etc. etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179523/#Comment_179523" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T13:37:48+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  1:37PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 1:39PM by Brand_Robins.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a slight bias towards the Requiem Chronicler's Guide, which has a dozen ways of setting up Vampire campaigns that aren't just the standard. Plus, it's got that asshole Sorenson's "Monster Garage" thing, which does an excellent job of making the Storytelling system 80% of the way into a Story Game. <br/><br/>If you like a lot of detail about the city as both a setting and character in Vampire games, then Damnation City is a hard book to beat. Crunchy, crunchy, and crunchy and too much for me to use it all ever -- but a book that should have come out for 1st ed Vampire, considering the role of the city in just about any Vampire game. <br/><br/>After those two, I'd go with either The Blood (crunch for players) or Mythologies (so you think you know what vampires are, huh?) or Coteries (as Bret says) to round it out. <br/><br/>Finally, though its more like an alternate game all its own, Requiem for Rome got my juices into full boil.

Basically the idea was that we would provide support for GMs running World of Darkness games in the form of NPCs, a pregenerated setup, and of course the thrill of cross-game pollination of events and characters. Need a fake birth certificate? Pick up the phone and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7813" rel="nofollow">call the Gomezes</a>.  That is great fun if it can go, and also, many hands make light work - the work of distilling a big complex game like a White Wolf game down to a campaign is tough, and it's a lot easier with more people pitching in.  Of course there is only benefit if there are GMs and groups running games, and right now there's just me, so it's really not gone anywhere yet.<br/><br/>2 - The launch campaign is an idea that someone had that basically would "prime the pump" of players and GMs.  The idea is that we would pick some venue (a game store, a coffeeshop meeting room, a library conference room) and hold a biweekly game for 3 months or so (6-7 sessions total) with a multiple-table, shared-world game in this universe in order to A) introduce new players to the game in a "controlled environment" where they could get the basics of system and setting, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> get potential GMs interested in the project, and C) get everyone who might be interested in playing in a group networking with each other.  We intend for this to happen between January and April of 2009.<br/><br/>We picked Vampire for the first "launch campaign" because it's an iconic White Wolf game, it's very easy to grasp and loads of fun to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wood" title="Wood"><img alt="Wood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wood">Wood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179706/#Comment_179706" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T14:49:33+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  2:49PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2008 2:50PM by Wood.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/><br/>Finally, though its more like an alternate game all its own, Requiem for Rome got my juices into full boil.
