Later, I found that the expanse of point-buying and the like ended up getting in the way of me playing anything more than a one shot of it. However, there was one thing at the time that really stuck in my head, and I've been thinking about it a lot already, particularly in thinking about a "Final Fantasy" style game:<br/><br/>You don't make any attack or damage rolls in combat. You just describe what happens during the minute "rounds", and narrate it. <br/><br/>After that, depending on what you ended up doing, and tactics that you employed, you would make a kind of "damage roll" after the rounds or match ended.<br/><br/>Anyway, for a while now like most folks who grew up on Zelda and Final Fantasy, I've been thinking about a tabletop FF game. However, any way I tried to cut it it turned out that the level grinding and combat that can be fun (or frustrating) in those games was simply long and boring on the tabletop.  And since I've been bending towards more social games, or games where social rules could be as powerful as combat rules, not to mention that ephemeral "story gaming style of play", I've found breaking things up with a mess of combat tends to get boring, repetitive, and anticlimactic (which, honestly, is how I find a lot of the random combat in even my favorite console RPGs like FFX, FFX-2, etc... but now I'm bored with my friends). Especially in combat conflicts in FF-style games, where the result of "failing the conflict" is "everyone dies: Game Over".<br/><br/>So, just a little idea that I wanted to drop and kick around a bit: Combat as "important", and something that happens in the game, but something that is entirely resolved through narration. <br/><br/>Things to think about in that regard (totally rhetorical, but feel free to include in your thoughts):<br/>* Does the narration in combat have any effect? Like, if you say "I use my spear" or "I perform Hard Knuckle Fire Slash!", does that do anything in-game?<br/>* Before combat, are there any rolls or rules that dictate how narration happens?<br/>* After combat, are there any effects based off stuff that happened in narration?<br/>* How is combat paced? Does one person describe everything? Or does each player describe their own character?<br/>* Is there pacing in combat? Narration rounds? Turns? How do you decide who narrates? (In Kayfabe, the wrestler players simply take turns).<br/>* What's the role of the GM in narrating combats?<br/>* What would be the point of creating a combat "fruitful void"? What other kinds of things could you focus on in lieu of making combat all narration-based and mechanic-free?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69971/#Comment_69971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T08:15:34+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  8:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you feel this would differ from  resolving combat like anything else in the system, with a simple rather than complex roll, narrating it to the same extend that one might a breaking and entering attempt or a masterful dance?

In the idea that I had above, the thing going through my head with the FF emulation was this:<br/><b>The PCs always win combat</b>. ALWAYS. Otherwise, you'd get "game over", which is boring and breaks the game (unless you were using "save crystals" and the like (^.^) ). Narration just shows you How they win. Dice rolls, if used at all, might come before the combat to add an element of "fortune in the middle" (dictating narration while incorporating the elements shown on the dice), or afterwards to add...??? I dunno here.<br/><br/>In most games, combat is another conflict where you can succeed or fail. In Kayfabe, the winner is decided when the wrestlers enter the ring, and the narration for three rounds (taking turns between players) is simply color to create excitement, and possibly use manuvers (like "sandbagging" where you dickishly leave your body limp when the opponent lifts you, because you have a personal grudge against that wrestler; it has a higher chance of injuring him with back strain, muscle pull and the like).<br/><br/>Something like that appeals to me for a game where "PCs Always Win Combat" is a given, where the only stakes are "do you kill the monsters, or do they kill you"?<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------<br/><br/>As an aside, it also shows how I broke TSOY once, and why there's "Only people, no monsters".  WIth people, you can change tactics from talking, to combat, to wrestling, to subdual, to reasoning, to bargaining, etc. The stakes can switch from "I kill you" to "You allow me to marry your daughter after all".  WIth monsters, the only goals are "They Kill You" (no reasoning, etc) so it's not nearly as interesting, and the players are tempted to never lose conflicts (beacuse the stakes with monsters are always "do they eat you or not").<br/><br/>I ran a very long TSOY game (over a year), and every time I introduced a monster-type (rare, but it happened) it was always kind of unsatisfactory, because you couldn't change intentions without getting eaten, killed or crushed.<br/><br/>Thinking on it, though, I COULD make a mod to TSOY which allows monsters.  You would probably make a combat roll against a certain number once, and that result showed you how much damage you took, which could be mitigated by spending pool points. THEN you use those results to narrate what happened in the fight against the monster.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69981/#Comment_69981" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T08:46:13+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  8:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite><br/>You're not saying "pure narration" or "non-adjudicated," right?

Might be too ambitious for one thread, maybe?<br/><br/>At first (before I started the thread), I was thinking of the latter: IIEE is all roleplayed out, with a dice mechanic up front for doing the "fortune in the middle" stuff, or at the end for determining effect (in phases, rounds, etc).<br/><br/>Later, I was thinking it might even be interesting to explore pure narration, non-adjudicated, as well: What happens when the rule is "PCs always win: GO!" and then afterwards either determine effect based on narration (not using dice.  Ex: See AMBER), or there's simply no game effect at all, and combat is just color scenes, needed and fun, but nothing more impacting than "roleplaying the encounter with the shopkeeper as you buy ale, rope and a short sword".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69988/#Comment_69988" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T08:57:25+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  8:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy: Do you want to look at the emulation of Random Encounters, Boss Fights, neither or both?

Attack words would have to be countered with appropriate defense words, magic would be 'special effects' counterable by other magic. Here's the thing, you'd tell the story Burning Wheel style, in phases, with no more than 3 words in any phase, trading sentences with the opponent and other players. Resolution wouldn't be win/lose but would say how much resources (HP/Mana/Healing potions) you lose to keep at full health (you have to keep the players at full health!), if you can't get to full health with your current resources, you have to rest, and then Bad Shit can go down.<br/><br/>Sorry for the brain barf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70001/#Comment_70001" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T09:34:06+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  9:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW: 'Bad Shit' in this context means character-based conflicts.

Hose fight?<br/><b>The Cheese Fight</b> - or as I like to call them, "Marlboros".  The opponent who has something cheesy, like a self destruct or massive status effects.<br/><b>Attrition</b> - This is where the real tension comes in. You're low on potions and mana, and there's no place to restock or rest. Each fight is taking a little bit more out of you, and the fear that you're going to run into the boss, or just get ground down by sheer volume,  before you find a save point absolutely ratchets up the tension.<br/><br/><br/>So, I guess the desirable goal is attrition, but getting there from narration....not quite sure.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70009/#Comment_70009" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T10:00:32+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 10:00AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>BTW: 'Bad Shit' in this context means character-based conflicts.

I think that you need to support both to really nail that 'final fantasy' feel.<br/><br/>Jiving on what Rob and Remi are saying, combat in FF is primarily about how many resources you are forced to expend (mostly in the form of potions but more abstractly in the form of Gil) versus the reward expected (gil, items, and xp). Looking at it on a graph and factoring out death, the xp gain is always positive over time played (which means it can pretty much be factored out as a 'reward factor'). So, what you are left with is progress (towards the next 'location' or story scene) versus resource cost. <br/><br/>You might create three statuses for each character: Positive resources (they are progressing more quickly than expected), Even resources (they are progressing at the expected level), and Drained resources (they are progressing slowly enough that they might have to 'turn back' and return to the previous town).<br/><br/>Although this is pretty rough, these statuses would impact how many cool 'abilities' and items your characters were able to purchase in the next town. It might also impact how difficult the 'boss fight' is (if there is one incoming).\n<blockquote><br/>* Does the narration in combat have any effect? Like, if you say "I use my spear" or "I perform Hard Knuckle Fire Slash!", does that do anything in-game?<br/></blockquote>\nIf you have given them lots of cool abilities to use in the boss fights, I would say that trying to differentiate abilities in random fights is overkill. Besides which, FF players are mostly on autopilot through normal battles anyway (perhaps the key is defining a sort of 'standard' strategy and only change things when their standard strategy would cause poor results [like using water bullets on a water elemental].).\n<blockquote><br/>* Before combat, are there any rolls or rules that dictate how narration happens?<br/>* How is combat paced? Does one person describe everything? Or does each player describe their own character?<br/>* Is there pacing in combat? Narration rounds? Turns? How do you decide who narrates? (In Kayfabe, the wrestler players simply take turns).<br/>* What's the role of the GM in narrating combats?<br/></blockquote>\nHere is a sketch of mechanic:<br/>Each player has a pool we will call 'resources'. GMs have a pool that we will call 'Opposition'.<br/><br/>The GM starts off by describing the terrain. He then pays a point to create a basic creature. If he wants it to have any 'special' abilities he pays an additional point as well (this will take the form of an immunity to a specific sort of attack).<br/><br/>Here we will assume the immunities are: White Magic, Black Magic, Blue Magic, Time Magic, melee damage, ranged damage, and 'specials' (you could make this more 'strategy' based and make them immune to 'frontal magic attack', 'status effect attack', 'physical barrage', etc). <br/><br/>A player pays a point of resources to declare a 'strategy' to defeat the monster. And narrates his attack. (assume the stragegies are the same as the immunities but based on the character's class).<br/><br/>If this strategy has not been 'blocked' then the players win. Victory dance.<br/><br/>If the strategy has been 'blocked' then another player is forced to pay a point to declare a strategy and narrate the attack. And so on, until they either run out of resources or until the players win.<br/><br/>What are the effects when the players run out of resources? Probably, you would want to fold the remaining 'opposition' pool into the bosses ability pool so that they will really have to work hard against him. I do like Remi's thoughts on the matter though... that running out of resources triggers 'story' (and proabably 'bad story' as opposed to good things happening).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70029/#Comment_70029" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T11:11:01+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 11:11AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the real neatness is to make the Random Fights more like Boss Battles, but not completely so.<br/><br/>Fight the mooks, but fight the mooks because they matter to the story.

But I think that one should check the goal first before going on. That is, do you really want to make a game all about resource/real-time management, just because that's the only thing that works well for CRPGs?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that what we really like about the CRPGs? We play because of the sense of accomplishment of having grinded our way to the next cut-scene, no? Where we can relax, take a breather, and be passively entertained. The faster this is done, the greater the sense of satisfaction. It's a matter of having been efficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n(It is ironic, however, that sometimes the most efficient strategies - changing bullet type - sometimes take more button-presses and human delay than just autopiloting through, making otherwise bad strategies the fastest in play)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, assuming that you do want to make it about resource management, there is an issue, which is that in TTRPGs, things move much more slowly than CRPGs. So Adam is right to try to condense it down to get something more like what you're asking for, Andy. But to abstract things is, I think, a mistake. Because it's the nature of the choices for resource management that are the interesting parts. Do I buy 5 potions that heal 10 HP each for 50 gil, or 1 potion that heals 50 HP for 30gil? How often will I screw up and let a party member fall down, requiring phoenix feather to wake them up so that I don't waste even more resources, or (gasp!) get a TPK and have to go back to save?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot saying that you have to do these particular sorts of choices, but that the point is to have some meaningful choices at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of Adam's interpretation of Remi's idea that losing should trigger bad story penalties - I think this won't work right - how about a more straightforward requirement to have to pay some sort of resource in order to have a character development scene? That is, the reward for a certain amount of well-performed grinding is getting to "Role-play" for a scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "party" may stop to tent for the night, and exchange ideas in character, but this should mostly only be for info-dumps back and forth. No actual plot advancement allowed!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70035/#Comment_70035" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T11:31:30+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 11:31AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2007 11:32AM by Remi.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to add something: I have a deep loathing for CRPGs (I've been trying to enjoy them, and failing, since Phantasy Star II) and wasn't trying to mirror the experience, exactly.
