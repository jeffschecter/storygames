<div class="Message">
                    This past weekend, I ran four games of Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium (Unrated Edition) at MACE.  Three on Saturday, and one on Sunday morning (after which, everyone packed up and bolted, so I decided not to stick around for my 2pm slot, seeing as how no one had signed up for it).<br/><br/>The games went well, and the players were mostly of strangers who had heard about the game, but didn't know much except that it was modern horror.<br/><br/>I first explained the nature of the game setting and mechanics, and then walked them through character creation.  The process took about thirty to forty-five minutes.  We then jumped right into gameplay.<br/><br/>The game played well, which was fun, because I hadn't run Dread with anyone outside my gaming group since it the first edition debuted at Trinoc*coN 2003.  Playing with people you don't know is always kind of a gamble, but I definitely enjoyed the sessions, and everyone else seemed to get a kick out of it as well.  <br/><br/>However, there were some issues.<br/><br/><b>1. Breaking The Law</b><br/><br/>I found it interesting that despite the core concept of the game (the characters are people with nothing left to lose, essentially suicide agents on a one-way mission to seek and destroy as many demons as possible before dying a horrible death), the players were often reluctant to, say, break down doors or punch strangers.  It's interesting to me, and I think that it might be setting-related.  People who wouldn't hestitate to burn down and orc fortress or take a swing at an ogre may still hesitate to do something "illegal" in a game set in the "real world".  I guess.  I don't know.  <br/><br/>It really took some coaxing to get people to just cut loose and flip out.  During a car chase, when Andy K's character jumped out of his car and landed on the hood of the mafia dude's SUV and opened fire, shooting the guy through his windshield and killing him, the other players were startled.  It was like someone had flipped a switch.  Up until then, I'd been saying, don't hesitate, do what you must, you're badasses, go for it, you're not going to get arrested, and if you do, you can disappear or hypnotize the cop or whatever.  But it wasn't until someone in the group got loco that everyone else realized that it was "safe" or whatever.  I'm thinking that I might need to find a way to explain this more clearly in the rules somehow.<br/><br/><b>2. Fly Into The Danger Zone</b><br/><br/>The players had access to Fury, which is a dice pool that the player can call on to perform crazy stunts like the Cock Punch or the Suicide Run.  However, even though these stunts were listed and described on the character sheet, the players appeared wary (for lack of a better word) of using these stunts.  Again, it took some coaxing to get them to kill points of Fury and do unreasonably dangerous things.<br/><br/>Of course, I know that the pressure of playing with strangers at a con means that people are just a little less likely to cut loose the way that they would in front of their friends, so I'm factoring that into the equation as well.  And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that the players were a disappointment to me because they didn't jump through my hoops and dance for me like well-trained monkeys.  I just wanted to convey to them that they were free to rampage through the city like monsters themselves, but I was having a hard time finding ways to say this without just giving orders ("Hey, why not just break that door down with your shoulder?")<br/><br/>I do feel like I should point out that I liked the groups, and everyone was really into the role-playing, and the games went well.  So I guess I'm saying that I feel like I either didn't explain something properly, or maybe it's just not conveyed sufficiently in the rules and whatnot.<br/><br/>Given that my system is more or less final, having been playtested during the four years since the first edition's release, I'm more concerned about the game's text.  As a user manual, it's got to convey everything that the player needs to know about the game experience.  Then again, are directives like "don't forget to blow shit up and do stupid crazy neckbreaker stunts" really appropriate?  At that point, it's almost like I'm saying, "If you don't play the way my gaming group plays, you're not having the right kind of fun."<br/><br/>Then again, given the way that many horror RPGs involve the use of characters who are considerably more fragile than the opposition, it may be that the players have been conditioned into a kind of timidity.  Perhaps the answer lies in the way that I describe the game.  Calling Dread a horror-action game may lead people to envision games like Cthulhu, in which the players are generally outgunned by the monsters and demons.  Maybe I should call Dread a supers game?  <br/><br/>Hell, I don't know.  I just want to make sure that the players don't spend all their time stalking about with flashlights, peering nervously into shadows.  <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that this didn't happen too much in my con games this weekend, but there was enough trepidation that I wondered if maybe there was something amiss in my approach to the game experience.<br/><br/>Of course, any feedback from attendees would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                </div>

                            I remember trying to convince Shane and Scott that we should stop pussyfooting around, but I remember being hesitant, too. I shoulda just waited for my invisibility to wear off so I could have killed some people in the house, too.<br/><br/>Rafael, maybe it's the concept that we're protecting the world from the horror of these demons which is screwing things up. If we protect the world from demons, maybe we should also protect the world from most of the consequences of our actions to do so? If you tell us that we're killing demons because that's all we have left to do in life and that we're not doing it for some warped sense of responsibility (which maybe I inferred instead of understood), maybe the idea will come across to raise Hell when fighting Hell.<br/><br/>Also, if you want to easily flip the switch, tell the players that their actions are going to have nasty side effects/consequences no matter what their choices are and then do it. Then, when I see that I have nothing to gain from subtlety or protecting my character from ultimate doom, I'll jump in and doom myself.<br/><br/>Finally, for this post, I wanted to ask you about the Drives and the Fury refreshes. Will non-con play involve your Death Spiral hitting on the Drives of the characters? If not, I think if you added a place for the Drives to fit in to the Spiral so the GM can interweave opportunities for them in the story. As for the Fury refreshes, I can see why you don't want to announce them early on as they might be circumvented later and all that, but DO ANNOUNCE when we've reached a situation with one of those as the possible conclusion. Call it Demon Hunter's luck or a Precognition everyone has or whatever, but I love the concept and don't want to fumble blindly hoping to hit your ideas. Lay them out! And if the players, bless their souls, think that it's a stupid refresh, discuss a new one right there! It'll lead the story for both parties' satisfactions.<br/><br/>I've got a lot more thoughts but I'll wait until we've hashed out some of this.                        </div>

                            Hi, Mark,<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!<br/><br/>I guess I should present some context for those not familiar with the game.  Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium is a horror-action game in which players are Disciples, people with nothing left to lose.  Heroin addicts, ex-convicts, alcoholics, the falsely accused, the despondent, shell-shocked soldiers... basically, people who had hit rock bottom before getting recruited into the war between heaven and hell.  The Disciples hunt demons, which amounts to a suicide mission (which is fine, because they're obviously expendable -- at least, according to those who have recruited and trained them).<br/><br/>Each character has a one-word Drive which summarizes his or her primary motivation for going on in this new life.  For example, a drive of Vengeance might mean that the character seeks revenge against the demons that slaughtered his family, or a drive of Protection might point to the character's drive to shelter innocent people from the horrors in the darkness, etc.  During gameplay, a player can invoke Drive to gain a bonus to any actions (by describing the way that the player feels about the situation).<br/><br/>The Death Spiral is my name for a diagram that I use to plot out the events in a given scenario.  It consists of several locations, grouped in a circular grid.  Each location is accompanied by a description of any evidence, clues, or other information at that place, along with notes regarding any adversaries that the group might encounter along the way.  Since each game of Dread begins with an adventure hook that can lead to several different locations, it's possible for two groups to have wildly diverging experiences while investigating the same case.  I call it the Death Spiral because the adventure hooks are located at the edge of the circle, but the demon's in the middle, and if you trace the players' route from location to location, you often get this wacky spiral that leads to the center.<br/><br/>So --
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite> If you tell us that we're killing demons because that's all we have left to do in life and that we're not doing it for some warped sense of responsibility (which maybe I inferred instead of understood), maybe the idea will come across to raise Hell when fighting Hell.</blockquote>
I really like "raise Hell when fighting Hell".  That's a great line, and I might just swipe it.  But yeah, the notion of responsibility is an interesting one.  It's definitely implied in the rules (directly communicated, in fact), in the sense that the players can't just murder indiscriminately.  But I guess I'm thinking more about the reluctance to just break into a dead guy's apartment to ransack the place for clues.  I am accustomed to a gaming group that regards the law as a minor inconvenience at worst, so perhaps I need to just include a section on acceptable behavior for the group.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>Will non-con play involve your Death Spiral hitting on the Drives of the characters?</blockquote>
It's not covered explicitly in the rules.  Drive is only one word, because a concept like Justice is easier to work into gameplay than "I want justice for the downtrodden homeless that sleep on the sewer grates in West Baltimore".  And so, the way it's worked in the past, it's just up to the player to find a reason to invoke it.  Since it's such a broad concept, it shouldn't be too hard to come up with a way to justify its invocation.  Of course, in a one-shot con game, with so much going on, I wasn't surprised to see that it wasn't used very much, but in my experience, players find ways to work it into high-pressure situations towards the end of a session (as the stakes increase).  So no, I hadn't really planned on making Drive a part of the Death Spiral.  <br/><br/>For example, with a Drive of Atonement (let's say the player was an alcoholic police detective who botched a case and let a serial killer go free because he screwed up the evidence somehow, and the killer promptly went out and murdered someone else, and the ex-detective feels that he must atone for his failure because it's his fault), the player alone should really be able to decide what particular action would help him atone for his past misdeeds.  If I were to include a note saying, player should feel atonement when this or that happens, it might not work, because often, large portions of the Death Spiral remain unexplored.  It's not necessary for the group to visit every location, or get into every potential brawl with bad guys prior to taking down the demon.  So my planned Drive invocation might never take place, because the team never did what I expected them to, or the player didn't think to invoke Drive when I hoped he would.  Instead, I let the player decide what works, and just roll with it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>As for the Fury refreshes, I can see why you don't want to announce them early on as they might be circumvented later and all that, but DO ANNOUNCE when we've reached a situation with one of those as the possible conclusion.</blockquote>
Now, that I kind of like.<br/><br/>Ah -- Fury.  So, along the way, this dice pool, Fury, can be refreshed by completing certain secondary objectives.  The primary objective would be to kill the demon.  Every game of Dread ends with a demon blown to smithereens.  But, along the way, the characters get mixed up in the lives of the people affected by the demon.  They might have an opportunity to help those people.  For example, if the demon is a defiler, then it's a possessing demon that's taken over a victim's body.  A secondary objective in this case might be to save the life of the possessed person.  If the players manage to exorcise the demon prior to killing it, then everyone would get back a little bit of Fury.  If not, and if the group has to terminate the demon by killing the victim, then there's no Fury bonus.<br/><br/>I hadn't thought to tell the players about such moral choices, but perhaps it would help to make that an option.  Some groups might prefer not to be told, as it robs a scenario of moral gravity somewhat (essentially, reducing a decision to maximizing a gameplay mechanic, as opposed to a gameplay mechanic that rewards certain kinds of decisions).  But I definitely need to think about that some more.<br/><br/>Wow, thanks again for the great feedback!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            Oh, I got more.<br/><br/>I didn't realize in the game that my Drive was being sublimated down to one word (even though I only wrote one word like I was told). This is a lightbulb for me. I'm used to such traits in games, but I didn't pull this out somehow.<br/><br/>Consider this: On the character sheet on the third page at the bottom you have all of our interesting Fury options. That sucker needs to work it's way to the first page. Either make equipment separate cards or find some way to minimize them. Then add a section called: You're fucked. What're ya gonna do now? And under it include all of our options AND include something that says, "Did you hit your Drive? Why not?" or "If you didn't hit your Drive and you're dying because of it, you deserve what you get."<br/><br/>We have some great graphic designers on this board and just had a contest based off of character sheets.

                            Also, when I have more time I too will chime in with stuff.<br/><br/>But the quick:<br/><br/>1) Yeah, I think you need to spell it out "Raise Hell to Fight Hell"<br/><br/>2) I think emphasizing that the characters often work for the greater good, and start to develop their own sense of law, which usually results in ignoring law-laws.  This is actually probably my favorite part of the Dread experience. Breaking into houses, shooting mafia dudes or skinheads without fear of repurcussions (well, some fear, but also the badassitude knowing that I could literally get away with murder through my own spell or strength resources), and yet coming back to knowing that it's all for the greater good, and likewise avoid doing evil things, driving a car through a crowd of kids, etc. Every PC in Dread would be "Chaotic Good" if it was D&amp;D.<br/>There's the badassitude, but it also eventually leads to a sort of Thoreauian questioning of societal laws in play. It's awesome, and it's hard to get there if you come from a background of CoC or other horror games like, "If I break into the clinic the GM will have me running from cops for the rest of the session".<br/><br/>3) Maybe a word about how plans are cool and all, but to not worry too much about repurcussions until they happen (or if it's something BIG). And as the GM, to not force the PC to be held accountable for every B&amp;E. Ex: If a PC gets caught raiding the files of a police station after dark, and gets chased by the cops... let them get away (eventually?), and simply "close down" the police station as a place to get more info for that adventure (guards on alert, etc) so that they have to find another way. Don't have the police chase them all over town, put up wanted posters, actively hunt them down, etc.  This may sound natural, but in most "break the laaaaaaws!" games the GM is encouraged to take the players to task every time they step outside of the law.<br/><br/>4) Same as above, but with "making plans" instead of "laws". Laying plans for an op is cool and cathartic, as well as good exercise for the brain ("Oh, but what if there are guards there? We better take the sewers"). But maybe it needs some advice for groups so that they don't hit a Loop of Fear, afraid to act rashly in case they are caught off-guard. "This ain't your motherfucking Twilight 2000, bitch. Grab that shotgun and charge the gates if you want to!"<br/><br/>5) I love the fury refresh incidents as-is. They are creative landmarks in the adventure, and by keeping them hidden (that is, not saying "Hey, if you rescue that guy you all get Fury back") keeps the players more alert and aware of the environment and scenery. I can't think of a reason why they need to be revealed as they appear. I think it would be cooler at the end of the session, after the epilogue, to almost imagine the "LEVEL CLEARED" screen, where we see how the players got their scores. Then the GM comes out and reveals the 1-2 Fury Marks that they missed. That way they find out anyway, and yet you're not slapping their asses in the adventure, riding them to go out of their way to grab at your +2 Fury Donuts as they appear. If anything, make "revealing the Fury Marks as they appear" some kind of optional rule.<br/><br/>EDIT: Uh, that was suposed to be quick. Instead it was Everything I Meant to Say.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Or make it a definite part of the setting, in some way. For instance, you could say that most law operatives (FBI, Marshals, Police, etc.) know that there are cells of anti-Demonic terrorism out there and they're a bitch to arrest and near impossible to keep jailed. Then, if you want to have scenes with antagonistic operatives, they could be naive, obsessed with their particular case/jurisdiction, or just plain crazy. That would turn the breaking-the-law repercussions from punishment to grabby story.<br/><br/>A: "Man, why was that traffic cop giving us such shit?"<br/>B: "I dunno, but now he's trailing us. I think he just went from annoyance to obstacle. Didn't you say the demon loved targets with low self-esteem?"<br/>C: "Crap, yeah. Oh crap he's going to ram us!"<br/><br/>Or:<br/><br/>A: "Give us ten minutes and we won't take your files."<br/>B: "You guys get away with murder!"<br/>A: "Yeah, we do. Hey, that's a good idea ..."<br/>B: "Alright, alright, here's the key."
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>to almost imagine the "LEVEL CLEARED" screen</blockquote>
Then, yeah, tell us at the end. I just wanted to know where the milestones were.

Maybe, then, any Fury retrieved from these Milestones could be spent then instead of being lost?

I agree with your entire post, but this one in particularly struck a nerve.  It's fear of the GM, really.  The book states that the players and the GM need to agree on this issue prior to gameplay, but with everything that was going on during the con game, I didn't really make time for this aspect of character creation (or the creation of a headquarters, or a bunch of other stuff...).<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

That's an interesting idea.  Ideally, I'd want the players to kill all their Fury during the game, but the idea of a post-game wrap-up is intriguing...
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>Also, what was that last minute thing about blowing Fury at the beginning for the stuff down at the bottom of the sheet?</blockquote>
Yeah, the Longshot is something that's done at the beginning of every session during campaign play.  For a one-shot, like our game on Saturday, it's not really applicable (which is why I only mentioned it in passing).<br/><br/>At the beginning of each session of Dread, each character has 12 points of Fury.  These can be spent in-game to perform stunts, or they can be used at the very beginning of the game for a Longshot.  The Longshot is Dread's advancement mechanic.  You gamble all 12 of your points of Fury by rolling 12 dice.  Any 1s or 7s are tallied, and if you get three of either, you get a new background or a new spell.  It usually takes a while to accumulate enough 1s or 7s.  The upside is, if you've only got two spells, this can help.  The downside is, you don't have access to the Fury (and therefore the stunts) that your teammates have.  But it might be worth it.  It's a gamble.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

Have you done the math on the probability of a Longshot being accomplished? Do you know if it matches the frequency you would want (once every session, 5 sessions, etc.)?

Ye--<br/><br/>Wait, what?<br/><br/>Well, me an Paw never went in fer all that book-larnin, but unless I'm mistaken (hoo boy), the chances of rolling a 1 with three d12s are 397 out of 1728, or about 23%.<br/><br/>Since the player can also benefit by rolling a 7, I guess I ought to factor that into my calculations somehow, but I lack the skill.  Basically, the progression to date has been something like, every six or seven games, the player gets another spell or a new point to spend in background.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            I didn't get a chance to look at much in the book besides the spells, but I think if you are looking for over-the-top stunts and actions by the players, it would best be conveyed through the examples.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of B&amp;E action and daring, daylight, police station raids presented in the text would work their way into the expectations of play for the group better than trickle-down economics into Reagan's fevered dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe there could be a mechanical reward if you attempt each of the stunts on the sheet once in a game.<br/>
<br/>
Are you more concerned that people didn't try crazy, illegal shit to solve the scenario or crazy stunts to kill the bad guys?  Or both?<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the examples mentioned above, the most important thing I could think of would be a note to the GM explaining that the game was designed to be played this way and that you would encourage them to not punish players for things that would go badly in other horror games (and I would never call your game a supers game, because I think that would set up a whole other set of expectations).  If the players saw that they could get away with this shit then they will start doing more of it and a good time will be had by all...<br/>

Hey, Shane.  Probably a little more concerned about the former than the latter.  And only because I felt like maybe I could have explained the world of Dread better during the setup.  As for the game text, I'm thinking that there's a lot of examples in there that show the Disciples doing loco stuff, so I guess that it will come through, but I think that I'm going to add --<br/>

                            How about January 15th?  That will give me enough time to make sure everything's working okay.  The entries should be PDFs, of course.  Um, I can't think of anything else.  Contact info, I guess?  Which would be acronical(at)dread-rpg(dot)com.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>
