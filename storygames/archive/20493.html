Nobody ever saw them again, until in a scene later, the main character gets lost in the desert and comes across the remains of a camel, then another one, and then he finds so many that they cover the ground as far as he can see. All are pointing in the same direction, gems and rags still among their bones and dried skin. The main character then remembers that when a guide gets lost in the desert, the last thing they try is to go as far as they can in a single direction, in the hopes of getting out of the desert somewhere. Well, I hope the image helps trigger some ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oscar_S" title="Oscar_S"><img alt="Oscar_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/897/n4UTRWTU37TM7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oscar_S">Oscar_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450392/#Comment_450392" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T16:30:56+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  4:30PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What species are the assassins?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450393/#Comment_450393" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T16:42:50+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  4:42PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What species are the assassins?</blockquote>Oh, that's easy.  3 Fluttermantises, 3 clickers, coordinated by a Great Mantis and the grafted Fluttermantis/stoneguard noble ( Kit't'kat'ke ) who's their sponsor. <br/><br/>The are out at Kit't'kat'ke's direction.
