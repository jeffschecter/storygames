Is there a significant difference?<br/>\nPlease bear in mind that this comes on the heels of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15162&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">my previous first-ever DW session</a>, so there are five players (it is also probably worth noting that the only character whose class is not represented in the Redbook or a separate playbook is the Ranger, and also that he appears by all accounts to love being a Ranger).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I see it, I really have four directions I can go here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA: I transition to Red Book rules whole cloth, and as the Ranger to be a Cleric (I don't like this idea, since only one player has to be put out, and that seems shitty).<br/>\n<br/>\nB: I transition to Red Book rules, but allow the Ranger version from the "Full" rules (but I don't know how compatible the class is with the Red Book, and also he'll be the only player without a proper playbook).<br/>\n<br/>\nC: I transition to Red Book rules, and attempt to edit the Ranger found in the "Full" rules to be compatible (though I don't feel qualified to do that yet, as I am not aware of what changes that might entail in order to maintain a modicum of "balance" and harmony with Red Book).<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> I transition whole cloth to the "Full" rules and ignore the Red Book entirely (not sure if this is a good idea since they are an older version of the rules. Are there as many internal consistencies as there are in Hack? Also there is the issue of a lack of proper playbooks, so lots of paper per player...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...what do we think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344742/#Comment_344742" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T09:07:13+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  9:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2011 9:07AM by Anarchangel.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read the Hack version TBH, but I the Red Book characters work fine with the AG rules and vice versa.

I'd take a look at the two respective move lists and pick the one you like best, then just keep the characters you have or remake them as Red Book characters (or AG Ranger).<br><br>The main thing is that everyone is using the same basic move list.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344749/#Comment_344749" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T12:52:44+00:00" title="October  3, 2011 12:52PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok cool, thanks. I just wondered if the redbook playbooks interacted well/poorly with the AG basic moves or vice versa. If they play nicely then i'd just as soon go with full on AG rules I guess. More paper, but i'd feel like a dick telling just one guy that he doesn't get a handy-dandy playbook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344751/#Comment_344751" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T13:36:55+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  1:36PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The AG rules do give an expanded treatment to explaining things to the GM, the Red Book is probably cleaner for the players.  I'd have everyone play redbook characters except your ranger but have the caveat that when they release the Ranger he has to update his character accordingly.  I mean, if he wants to play the ranger and the other classes are covered, why not let him have a go at it.  Personally, I'm waiting for the next version of the AG rules to start up another game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344964/#Comment_344964" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T17:27:00+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  5:27PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use a collaboration of all the rulesets. Thr principles and GM moves stay the same. The front and monster design stay the same. Its just  the player moves that are a little different. Its no big deal. Just remember to alllow the moves to evolve from the fiction, rather than trying to fit a particular move into a scene. The mechanical effect is simply a way of interpreting the move into the story. I say go with the characters you've got, the playbooks you've got and develop fronts as per the rules. If you are hesitant about introducing a player move, run it by the group before play and ask them what they think. I haven't had a bad experience yet with this mishmash. Untill the full rules are complete, it works for us. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
