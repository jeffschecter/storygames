Feedback is appreciated <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This collection presents the <b>Dungeon World</b> project by System Matters. Which aims to bring a translation of the Powered by the Apocalypse game to Germany, offering a beautiful Deluxe edition. It\u2019s a project I\u2019ve been excited about, and jumped on it as soon as it went live. Next to this I did choose to include the pre-order project for <b>My Little Pony: Tales of Equestria</b> by Ulisses Spiele. I don\u2019t often include pre-orders, but this one just been to cute to skip.<br/><br/>Next to those the English projects are as well fabulous. I did back <b>Wicked Pacts</b> as the combination of Urban Fantasy with \u201eMafia\u201c elements hits right up my ally. The second edition of Stars without Numbers is a bit out of my budget, but sure worth having a look up. I do recommend the <b>Seco Creek Vigilance Committee RPG</b>. A Western RPG following the story game principles, putting the characters into an interesting place. Fans of the Powered by the Apocalypse games should take a look at <b>Sixty Mile Sky</b>. An SF take on PbtA I gladly support.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll find three game books, \u201echoose your own adventure\u201c game, where the first two do quite impress and tempt me. The hybrids offer a fascinating take on role-playing games and you\u2019ll find a extended crowdfunding for the \u201eWarring States\u201c The Dark Eye supplement.<br/>Oh, and there are a bunch of (imho) exceptional projects. Like dice coins or coins designed with very cool motives. Even a tabletop smoke machine!

A story focused game, in which one assume the roles of curious, anthropomorphic animal like creatures. Second to that I took a liking to <b>SINS</b>, a narrative game in which one assumes the role of powerful ex-dead fighting against monstrosities on a post-apocalyptic earth.<br/>If you fancy over the top, satiric science fiction, just take a look at <b>Iron Skies</b>. Yet you might as well take a look at <b>GROGNARD</b>, a biography of Loren Wiseman.<br/>In regards of the German tabletop RPG projects I do like <b>Protektor</b> a lot. It is a fun approach to Urban Fantasy. Where players play rather regular people with strange animal companions being heroic, or well trying to be. Next to that \u201eRise of the Dungeon Master\u201c gets a German translation by Feder &amp; Schwert.<br/>Next to those projects you\u2019ll find aplenty of cool map projects and other interesting pages,.. just check the collection:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Secondary Literature<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>6 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Story Game RPG<br/>1 Game Book<br/>1 Supplement<br/>2 Adventures<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>3 Accessoires<br/>2 Apps<br/>1 Secondary Literature<br/>3 Map / Terrain Projects<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Card Game<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Adventure                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466069/#Comment_466069" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-04T17:18:17+00:00" title="September  4, 2017  5:18PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/crowdfunding-collection-51/" rel="nofollow"><b><b>Crowdfunding Collection Nr. 50, which includes every tabletop project started between till 08.21 till 09.04.</b></b></a><br/><br/>Following a brief break you\u2019ll find two new German projects. Most notably there is <b>HeXXen 1733</b> from Mirko Bader, which offers a baroque setting plagues by various monstrosities in need of protection.<br/>Next to that, I extended my search for active crowdfundings towards the Spanish crowdfunding platform Verkami. Which currently aims to finance the translation of <b>Barbarians of Lemuria</b> as well as <b>Little Fears</b>. The projects are currently without a preview pictures, because I haven\u2019t figured how to get the picture link.<br/>As for the English projects, I am fascinated by <b>IDENTECO</b> coole Cyberpunk setting and flair, which has a certain nostalgic flair. <b>Westbound </b>on the other hand is a card based Weird West roleplaying game and <b>Era: Belam</b> extends the Era family with a SF game.<br/>You\u2019ll find many more interesting projects, supplements, dice, accessories and more, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Book<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Hybrid Role-Playing Game<br/>4 Supplements<br/>1 Adventures<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>4 Accessoires<br/>6 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Card Game<br/>1 Social Deduction Game<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Adventure                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
