However, an AP that sets up a situation and then seeks advice on how to "better" handle it... that's Gold.

Isn't that what AP threads are for, when stuff isn't working right and you're not quite sure what's wrong?  Or when you learned something new that can't easily be explained in a few lines? I also remember some threads where folks were just geeking out about how cool their first game of Lady Blackbird was or something like that.<br/><br/>Honestly, I mostly post to Bite-Size because I often only have a brief anecdote to share, rather than a whole nest of insights.  If I was currently playtesting something or trying out a new game for the first time, I'd probably write a heftier AP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269195/#Comment_269195" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T13:33:41+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  1:33PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no idea what a bite-sized AP is even FOR, other than bragging rights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269197/#Comment_269197" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T13:35:01+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  1:35PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2010 1:36PM by wyrmwood.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Barely related - if anyone can briefly summarize the core "AP sucks" argument for reference, that'd also be great.</blockquote>\nWell my take on it is two-fold:<br/>1) Actual play reports as theory tools are bad - because they are pretty poor translations of what is happening during, well, actual play. There is a strong tendency, both on part of the writer and the reader, to re-envision the dynamics of play into something more literary (whether it is the "story of the session" or the "lesson learned", or what not). <br/>2) Actual play reports are hazardous advertisement - because they work significantly better for some games rather than others. <br/><br/>This is not to say that actual play reports can't be enjoyable, just that they seem to be taken far too seriously. <br/><br/><b>The preceding view is offered for comparison purposes only.

Writing the AP helps me analyze my game experience.<br/><br/>To me they are different formats for different purposes. With bite sized AP threads, it is fun to get a feeling of what games people are playing currently. However, I like the last three games played/next three games on my play list threads more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269555/#Comment_269555" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T08:11:31+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  8:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever I'm about to run a new game I haven't run before I search the interwebs for AP reports.

I would love to though, if only to record what happened more perfectly than my shorthand notes during the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269803/#Comment_269803" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T08:58:10+00:00" title="May  3, 2010  8:58AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Whenever I'm about to run a new game I haven't run before I search the interwebs for AP reports.

Knowing how fun it can be (and what sort of fun it provides) is what usually interests me in the game in the first place.<br/><br/>So yeah, I value both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
