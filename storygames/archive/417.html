                    Hi!<br/>  OK, I have a question from the design pros:<br/>  "How do you encourage the casual gamer, you know the kind who have only played 'mainstream games,' to narrate with a little more flair?"<br/>  Somethings to elaborate:<br/><br/>    * It's a game with a GM<br/>    * It's task resolution<br/>    * It already has a sort of "Kicker" mechanism, but what I am asking for is different<br/>    * I currently have a "Stunt Bonus" type mechanism, but no one in my group is using it (possibly do to me not advertising it much) and other designers seem to think it is kind of flimsy<br/><br/>  So the question is, without losing the GM or Task Resolution, how do we encourage players that are not normally very talkative to elaborate in their description of their actions?<br/>Dave M<br/>Author of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)<br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/items/volume_12/201000/201024/4/preview/Legends_of_Lanasia_RPG_Beta.pdf" rel="nofollow">Free Demo</a> </div>

                            Hmmm. I'm sure we an kick out a few ideas to help, but this smells like something that the folks at the Forge (Indie Game Design forum perhaps?) would be better to ask.  Not that I'm saying "Close the thread and go over there!", I'm sure we can throw out a few ideas, but I'd also definitely take it over there as well. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Oh, and the obvious way is to offer bonus dice.  Sorcerer does this (and Sorcerer can be pretty task-based too) by offering a bonus die for adding something "good" to the roll (there's 5 distinct things, like "Good Strategy", "Effectiveness", "Coolness", etc).  <br/><br/>The game Dread by Raf Chandler got me totally into narrating effects because it has something called the "Cool die": Literally Every Roll where you spiced up your description, you get a die, which in that game was a big bonus.  Like, imagine for d20 if you got a free extra 1d20 to roll at the same time, and took the higher one: That's how strong the coolness rule was. And that also made it really easy to get into narrating things, from driving a car to researching monsters to asking for directions.  It seems like the players would "go overboard" with it, but there were times as well when the players didn't want the cool die as well (not often): They had just described 10 things cool in a row, and were like, "No, fuck it, this time? I Just Hit Him With My Axe."<br/><br/>So a bonus die to any and every roll is a big helper. Leave it in the middle of the table as a reminder.<br/><br/>The other thing is, say, when the player "misses", whether its a hit roll or a research roll, let them describe the results.  Maybe turn it over to them.  Sure, everyone wants a chance to look cool, but they probably also want to fail in their own way: Giving them the power to narrate how they failed makes sure that narration doesn't revert to "whiffs".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I noticed that there is definitely a different crowd here and over at the Forge. So, I thought I would ask the pros here as well.<br/>
  Interestingly, the only feedback I have received before this was negative, stating that providing bonuses for narration quality was sheer folly. So I thought I would ask more about alternatives.<br/>
  What do the rest of you think?                        </div>

                            The point, I guess, is to make the players care. This can be done by giving them some reward, or make them feel that they are making a difference, or they get to demonstrate something cool about there character.<br/><br/>Normally, when I have made a rule no one is using, it is because the player don't feel they get anything out of using it.<br/><br/>But could you tell a little more about how this mechanic work in your game?<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>

                            Following the same idea Andy was dicussing, the "bonus" may be of a finer grain and not so dependent on the judging of the master as in Sorcerer.<br/>
Think about Dogs in the Vineyard. You need to tell the audience how your character uses a trait to introduce it. This lead the players to narrate to get the dice.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think that a very nice narrative incentive is not a mechanical advantage in terms of statistical improvement on the resolution system. But a mechanic which allows player negotiation about other player statements. I have noticed playing Universalis and Polaris that some very strong statements, which other players hesitate to challenge or try to modify, are the ones best described and tied into the fictional actions and situation.                        </div>

                            The "problem" with die-bonus for narration which is probably the source of that "sheer folly" comment is that whether or not the given narration qualifies as "cool" is usually up to the Game Master to decide.  Which I don't think is a problem for your game, Dave, which already has a pretty empowered GM, anyway.  Alternately, you can have it explicitly awarded by the other players and not the GM, which <em>will</em> put a different spin on how the game actually works, so be careful.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I didn't see the "Sheer Folly" thread at the Forge (can you point that out), but here are two additions:<br/><br/>1) Quality of narration vs Quantity: You can't just push for Quality without Quantity.  That's like the myth of spending "quality time" with your family. You should rather encourage a way to get as much quantity of narration as possible, which will also hopefully pull in quality along with it (because at least SOME of your quantities of narration will be cool. No one bats 100%, but encouraging the players to step up to the plate more gives them more opportunities to hit home runs).. <br/><br/>2) Ah, yeah, after seeing JBR's comments. Some people say "Oh, but the coolness is up to the GM! Or the Coolness is left up to the players!  It's too subjective! What if you have a guy who always turtles, but finally comes out to say something cool, vs the person who can come up with cool things all the time!"<br/><br/>Folks who say this generally:<br/>A) Are Retarded<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Have shitty gaming groups<br/>C) Are arguing for the sake of argument<br/>D) Have never actually played a game with Fanmail, Cool Die, Gift Dice, etc. Because when you do, the nature of those so-called concerns melts like butter. The Shit Works if you Try It. There's no more to say on the matter.<br/><br/>It would help, of course, to describe conditions on which such a cool die would be awarded, where it wouldn't be awarded, and how the gaming group, personlities of the members etc might influence the cool die. This explanatory text will help the players understand when they should award their fellow players such coolness dice. <br/><br/>But yeah, I'm a big fan of games that reward you for describing things cool, or involving "tactics", etc. To the point that it's REALLY HARD for me to be involved in a game that doesn't have those mechanics.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>  So the two narrative encouraging tools I use now are:<br/>1) Destiny - Players start with so many and gain destiny points by advancing the current plot in an unexpected way, they spend Destiny Points to insert their own subplots or plot twists<br/>2) Narration bonus - Players get a bonus to their roll based on the quality of their narration<br/>Narrative Difficulty Modifier Table<br/>Quality------Difficulty Modifier--Example<br/>Normal----------- +0-----------I attack him with my sword<br/>Descriptive------- -1-----------My character lunges at their foe with his rapier<br/>Narrative--------- -2-----------Ã¢â‚¬Å“I shall avenge my comrades!Ã¢â‚¬Â Fredrick shouts as he fiercely wields his rapier and aims for the villainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart<br/>  Note: Lower Difficulties are better. Difficulty numbers range from 6 to 27 with an average task having a Difficulty of 12 and most  players will roll 2d6 and add between 6 and 14 (although potentially -4 to 17)<br/><br/>  Destiny has worked pretty well.

Hmmm, I found that Forge thread, and it looks like pretty solid feedback across the board. No negativity, save for the kneejerk "why not conflict resolution", but even then it wasn't really all that negative. <br/><br/>Or did you talk about it in another place or another thread earlier than that?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

It will be a little harder to say "This Narration is Better Than That Narration" unless you provide LOTS of text with explanation of the difference between Descriptive and Narrative.<br/><br/>For me, personally, I'd just give one standard bonus for ALL descriptive or "narrative" descriptions. That way it encourages people to continuously say more with each roll, without going too far over the top.<br/><br/>But I'm a little more hardcore about it: I'd actually give them, say, a bonus 1d4 or 1d6 to roll each time they said something descriptive/narrative, which they could subtract from the other 2d6 rolled.  It may seem not as "realistic", but hot damn if it doesn't REALLY get the players into the story.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>  I was thinking for the "Narrative" Difficulty Modifier that the players get a -1 per Player that thinks it is cool.

                            Hmmm. again, I dunno. It seems like it would be easier met with a simple "Does anyone think it's cool? If so, BONUS." I'd hate to see the game derailed because 3 people thought that some kung fu move was cool, but the other two disagree because they're not into kung fu, and a big disagreement follows.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Also, Dave, that meams you have to take a quick poll of all the players every time a the dice get rolled, which seems like it would get annoying. Depends on how fast paced you want the game to run, I guess.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Mike, that's a very good point. I am not sure thatI NEED the other players to say or feel COOL. hat might be raising the bar too high.<br/>
  Basically, just looking to encourage players that are on the edge. I don't think you can reach the terminally shy and obviously talkative people. Just tryong to encourage the peeps in the middle...<br/>

                            Hey,<br/><br/>Thinking about this, and what Andy said - maybe you could just have a system like this:<br/><br/>If another player describes what they are attempting in a way you think is cool, give them a thumbs up. The player gets a set bonus if anyone at all gave them the thumbs up.<br/><br/>Some players might just want to thumbs up at all times, but as long as it has to be a response to the active player adding some narration, I don't see this being a problem.                        </div>

                            Someday I know I'll see a rulebook that will gauge everything on the, "Did you enjoy it?" scale.  "Did you enjoy their description?  It succeeded."  It'll probably end up being an "American Idol" spin-off, though.  <br/><br/>[shivers]                        </div>

                            I'm thirding a Fan Mail kind of system - I used them in my WoD game for years without really codifying it - we'd use casino chips or some-such, and the person who got them could use them to re-roll 1 die per token, 1 token per roll.  You could also spend your whole shebang for one big success.  It was a very play-by-feel system - you could give a bunch of them if someone had a very good, prolonged, scene.  <br/><br/>As Storyteller, I was the only one who had an unlimited supply - everyone else used a set number in circulation.  When you spent one to re-roll a die, it went into a pot that was then re-divided at the end of the session or if everyone ran out.  Some people hoarded, some didn't.  Mostly they flew around the table - it's not only good for the ego of the players, but it encourages a sort of karma system as well.<br/><br/>Mind you, all of this means that we re-rolled quite a few dice in our days.                        </div>
