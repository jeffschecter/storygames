Lovely miniatures, and really great pricig compared to the metal versions of those miniatures. The pricing on the add-ons is incredible too, with the dragon and the giants being a fraction of their metal figure cost.<br/><br/>OTOH, I did get rid of almost every last fantasy miniature I owned when I gave them to my friends' son. If I buy in on this kickstarter at the juicy Vampitre level and add-ons, it will represent pretty much the entirety of a fantasy collection for me, at least in terms of character miniatures ( I still have puh-lenty of toy buildings and what not).<br/><br/>For discussion's sake, let's pretend you're in a similar situation. You're going to jump in on that Vampire level, but can upgrade as much as you want with add-ons. <br/><br/>Whatever you end up with is going to be your entire universe/collection of people minis.<br/><br/>What would you do with it? What game or hack of a game would you use? How would you recycle minis for use between connected games? What's the setting info? <br/><br/>How would you design it to use the minis you have, as opposed to theoretical stuff outside of that collection?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386715/#Comment_386715" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T05:51:27+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  5:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've gotten out of fantasy, what periods have you gotten into.

Like a lot of lead-heads, I actually already have a mountain of stuff still awaiting completion. as for what my personal collection, I have a big smattering of historicals from several settings starting at about the post-Civil War Old West and ending at about VJ Day. The fantastical stuff I own parallels that. So, prohibition era bootleggers and coppers along with Lovecraftian beasties, khaki-clad sons of Victorier along with much-oppressed canal martians. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>Of course, I do love a nice looking mini, and those minis from Reaper are lovely and at a great price.<br/><br/>As  I looked at them, i thought, y'know, even with that big of a collection, D&amp;D would still be a pain in the butt to play with only  those minis!<br/><br/>Not the tactical battle mechanics, mind you. Those things you love or hate as you will.<br/><br/>No, I mean the basic set up for D&amp;D. The Reaper sets do offer a good number of re-usable mooks. That's dandy. But then we get around to the more characterful stuff, the PCs and bigger, badder monsters.<br/><br/>I dunno how other folks play D&amp;D or similar games, but I can see a party of PCs sawing through most of that stuff pretty quick, as well as racing through a bunch of the PC miniatures roster as the PCs get killed off at lower levels.<br/><br/>I started this thread because I've been doing a bunch of minis+ threads advocating for different looks at minis use, and combining minis with story-game type play in different ways. This kickstarter actually could represent a pricey but broad buy-in collection for gamers deciding to jump onto that concept.<br/><br/>Buuuut...it's a different sort of creative constraint from those you have with verbal based SGs, where you can talk or write whatever you want into being. I wanted to hear what other folks could come up with to use and re-use those physical constraints of that particular collection in a new and interesting way.<br/><br/>As an example, the first thing I thought was to play with the metaphysics of the setting, use old skool D&amp;D mechanics and the basic set up for D&amp;D, and say that death wasn't permanent ( just painful and terrifying as you experience it), as a way of describing why figures could in fact be re-used. It was bound up wih more fiction than that, but it was the first thing that struck me about tryingto play ongoing games with a limited selection of miniatures that were (largely) meant to be seen as individuals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386789/#Comment_386789" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T23:48:51+00:00" title="August  9, 2012 11:48PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm probably going to jump on the Reaper kickstarter primarily to play Song of Blades and Heroes.

In most RPGs minis are placed on a drawn map and act as placeholders. They are tools for tactical combat and generally get ignored outside of that role. What Bob is talking about - and what I do in my miniatures games - is to put the minis in a central roll of the narrative. The figs are placed on an interesting terrain field and moved around but it is to set up scenes. <br/><br/>For example: My party moves into a town full of interesting minis. We split up and spread out. Tactically this is stupid. In D+D like RPGs it also makes play unplayable because you are focused on one player making the others sit idle. In a minis focused game though a player may point to a spot on the board and say what is happening there. Others may jump in and add to it or suggest additions (just like they do in Fiasco). It doesn't matter if your character is there or not. You don't have to introduce your character to add to the game so no one need be idle. Actions because they are stories don't have to be about combat, they can be about any interaction, including internal dialog. The terrain field is the stage we act on. <br/><br/>This requires pretty nice figs and good terrain so it is hard to start doing but boy is it fun. These are the type of games I want to run in my declining years. Games that don't have to be mass market.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386856/#Comment_386856" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-10T22:44:15+00:00" title="August 10, 2012 10:44PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a great way of describing it Chris.<br/><br/>I think part of the difference in outlook comes from just the premise that you start with the minis, then design a game around it, instead of trying to build a game, the figure out how the minis fiit into it.<br/><br/>I mean, maybe a minis collection like that is actually the inspiration for 15 or 20 very short games of different types, whether in mechanics or fictional set up, ornumber of players, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386901/#Comment_386901" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-12T01:04:28+00:00" title="August 12, 2012  1:04AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am tempted to get in on this.

It just seems like, to me, some kind of modified approach to something in-fiction to justify re-use would be better.<br/><br/>Also, some new stuff I'm learning about Dave Arneson's original Blackmoor games makes me think opening up use of those great monster figures to the players might be cool too.

People still hate the experience of dying ( because that sucks), but your characters can be released by the ruler of the dead realms after a certain amount of time ( or money paid to them or services done), with the length of time spent dead being influenced by how powerful the character was. Mooks spend very little time dead, while the very powerful might stay dead the equivalent of decades unless somehow released earlier. Goofy, but i like the way it explains why there is always a supply of low level characters and moks available along with why old major villains seem to crop back up much later (like sauron).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386916/#Comment_386916" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-12T10:44:08+00:00" title="August 12, 2012 10:44AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am also looking for a good excuse to get in on the kick starter but i really don't have one. i do sort of want to make kobold calvery with those rats though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386944/#Comment_386944" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-12T21:51:08+00:00" title="August 12, 2012  9:51PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2012 9:54PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Whatever you end up with is going to be your entire universe/collection of people minis.<br/><br/>What would you do with it?

Song of Blades and Heroes is written so that you can incorporate all of your fantasy miniatures into it -- you're just buying rules, not minis.  It has basic campaign rules written in, along with another book (Song of Deeds and Glory) that has more of the Mordheim style campaign, with exploration rules and all that sort of thing.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure that the 4 book bundle for fantasy still exists, the core game seems to be $8 now, that and the campaign rules would be $16.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388328/#Comment_388328" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T16:41:10+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  4:41PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've bought in on it.<br/><br/>What would I do?<i> So many things...so many games...so many ideas.</i><br/><br/>What will I do? <i>Probably add the figures to the queue of a few hundred that I've already got in various stages of "unpainted-ness".</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388342/#Comment_388342" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T19:42:37+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  7:42PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not going to beat myself up for not painting these all at once or before starting to game with them.
