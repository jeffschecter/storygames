I'm reviewing the book and while I feel the game rules will work nicely for authentic-feeling New Mutants stories (especially with JDCorley's mission bolt-on! Woo!), it strikes me that the thematic content implicit in the Values is geared to a slightly different trajectory than Xavier's School. So I want to see if I can tweak it ever so slightly in the direction I want.<br/><br/>So, Smallville's Values are:<br/><br/>DUTY<br/><br/>GLORY<br/><br/>JUSTICE<br/><br/>LOVE<br/><br/>POWER<br/><br/>TRUTH<br/><br/>Most of these I can see in the New Mutants just fine. I was uncertain about the TRUTH drive, until I realized that it doesn't have to be about honesty and deception; it can also be about insecurity, denial, delusion, belief and faith. Bam! The Truth value statements just flowed after that.<br/><br/>The sticky wicket, though, is JUSTICE. the thing is, while Justice might SEEM to be a solid Value for any superhero story or game...the New Mutants are, like, <i>barely</i> superheroes. Yeah, the're a <i>team</i>, and they have <i>powers</i>, and they go on <i>missions</i>, and sometimes even fight <i>villains</i>, but really they're just a collection of students with issues to work out. Most of the missions, they're <i>not supposed to go on</i>, because the Professor doesn't want to send them out like the X-Men to die; he wants them to stay home and be safe and train with their powers. And while they do fight a few plain ol' bad guys 9and gals), they mostly fight the hellions, who are another teen mutant team and basically just a rival school. Their teacher, Emma Frost, is eeeeviiiilll, but the students are mostly decent with a "we might have been friends" vibe going.<br/><br/>So, Justice seems an awkward fit. I mean, I can jam it in there, I suppose, but when I was trying to think of Justice statements I kept coming up with things that fit better under Power, or Duty, or, well, all of them, to a degree. And so I figured out that my challenge was to make a Value drive that wasn't redundant to the existing Values.<br/><br/>Mike Sugarbaker (who's playing in the game) suggested SECURITY, which seemed to make sense because teenagers, right? And the Prof wants to keep them safe and they want to take risks, and so on. But again, it seemed redundant. Most Security statements fit just fine under Love, or Power, or maybe Truth.<br/><br/>So. I want a new value. It can be anything that is non-redundant and relevant to 80s New Mutants, though I'd like to come up with something that's at least similar to Justice, esp. since it would help keep it mapped to the Lifepath choices without getting weird. For some reason I'm drawing a complete blank attempting to craft another value. Surely those six don't represent every ideal and yearning in the world?<br/><br/>It occurs to me that if I soften and personalize "Justice" into something like "Conscience" or "Ethics" or "Scruples" that could work. New Mutants has plenty of "lemme at 'em! they deserve no worse for what they did!" "No, we're better'n that!" type stuff going on. Sam's a straight shooter, bobby's pragmatic, Dani's devious, Rahne has tons of Protestant guilt, Illyana grew up in Hell and feeds opponents to demons. I still worry that it's got some redundancy: Most "Ethical" or "Scrupulous" stances would involve how ones wields Power, or their approach to Truth, or their personal definition of Love, and so on. So maybe I'm back to square one?<br/><br/>What do y;all think? Does Conscience/Ethics/Scruples look good and cogent and grabby? And which name do you like best? Any other alternate values you can think of? Has anyone experimented themselves with customizing the Values list? I'd love to hear your experience.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311016/#Comment_311016" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T23:46:56+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 11:46PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hahaha!  I love that you use the real-people names instead of going Cannonball, Sunspot, Wolfsbane, Magick (oh god, with the last two you can totally see why...).  I confess I've forgotten Dani, though.  Who was she?  And wasn't Xian Coy Mahn (Karma) in the picture too?  I always loved her power, and it seems perfect for an ethical hero game.<br/><br/>Anyway, DUTY, GLORY, LOVE, POWER, TRUTH -- all good.  What's missing?  Hmm.  <br/><br/>Maybe IDENTITY?  I mean, DUTY kinda covers the whole "why are we with Xavier and not the Hellions" thing, and TRUTH could cover "who am I really?" if you want.  But if you're milking those two for other concerns, IDENTITY might deserve some emphasis.<br/><br/>What about LIFE?  Meaning life and death?  Seems big for Illyana... maybe Rahne and Karma too...  Could interpret it as morality of killing, sense of mortality, grand purpose, suicide urges, celebration and joy.<br/><br/>I don't like ETHICS because navigating amongst DUTY, GLORY, LOVE, POWER, TRUTH <i>is</i> ETHICS.

A New Mutant who really seriously values Justice is one who wants to do the right thing <i>because it's the right thing</i>, not because Duty commands it or because it helps someone they Love or anything like that.  Or they want to punish the wicked because the wicked must be punished, or they want to make sure that the victim of an assault is fairly compensated, or whatever their particular ethos says is the right thing for the situation.  Their own internal moral conscience nags at them to do it.<br/><br/>Maybe all you need to do here is what you did for Truth, and take another step back to put Justice into a larger, more general context?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311020/#Comment_311020" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T00:15:59+00:00" title="February  4, 2011 12:15AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dani.  as in Native American Dannielle Moonstar  aka. Mirage and her flying horse/pegasus  "Brightwing"  (or was it Brightwind?).  Team leader,  before Sam. Also probably the older of the New Mutants - not sure how old Karma is compared.<br/><br/>And yes. Xian (pronounced Shawn) aka. Karma is there, though her problems (with the Shadow King - I believe it was) took her out of the core NM comics when I read them most... So I know less about her.  <br/><br/>And am I crazy and did I miss you mentioning... or are you guys for forgetting:   Doug Ramsey (aka Cypher)  and  self-soul-friend-of-Cypher-Doug... Warlock!  <br/><br/>I'd also consider thinking about Kitty  ("buu buuu, I don' wanna be an X-baby!")  and  all the Hellions...  Maybe even Firestar  (who made her debut in the comics, from her creation for the Spiderman Amazing Friends cartoon IN New Mutants)...  And maybe even venture into Angelica's later team, the New Warriors - which were the closest/best thing to New Mutants since Cable, Shatterstar and Domino (Liefeld I blame you) came and messed it all up - transforming the title into another "X" team.  Ugh.<br/><br/>You also have all the X-men (especially the originals)  to use as teachers.  Heck, Bobby is actually pretty near the New Mutants age, being by far the youngest X-man (not counting Kitty and maybe Piotr).  Not to mention Banshee and Moira that were often on campus teaching.  And then there were a few other side characters that hung with the X-men and X-babies... like Stevie.<br/><br/><br/>Sadly I know nothing about the game Smallville to help though.  I would love to know more but I can't translate all the game-speak going on with Smallville.  It hurts my brain.  This is an awesome idea though.

If you recall the X-men even "demoted" Kitty to be a New Mutant for a time and she always called them  "X-babies"  (that was before Mojo made the X-men into real X-babies).  And then the kids were always aspiring to be promoted to X-men status  (though very very few ever actually did!  for some odd reason).

Rules-wise, it's straightforward:  every character has a die rating in each of the Values, and every character also has die ratings for Relationships (established during character creation when you're all drawing a big-ass relationship map and determining how your characters are connected).  Each Value and Relationship gets a one-sentence description to encapsulate the character's feelings about it, like "People only want to hear good news" for Truth, or "She's out to get me" for a particular Relationship with another character.<br/><br/>Whenever the characters are called upon to go into a conflict, they always roll a Value die and a Relationship die, which basically means that everything they do tells you up front <i>why they are doing it and who they are doing it for</i>.  It's groovy.<br/><br/>There are other little fiddly bits, like how superpowers are handled and so on, but that's the heart of the system.  Everyone collaborates on building a relationship map that describes who their characters know, the places they frequent, etc., everyone describes their characters in terms of what they believe and who they know, and every conflict is basically asking and answering "Why does your character give a crap about this?"<br/><br/><br/>The book does spend an awful lot of pages talking about the Smallville show (the characters, etc.), and it is (unfortunately?) helpful to read through a lot of it in order to really get a clear picture of how to build a character and how to play the game, but thankfully the system itself is easily separated from the setting, as you can see in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311062/#Comment_311062" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T07:38:45+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  7:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justice works because it's an aspiration for the New Mutants, not a reality.

Or - a google search on "Doing the Right Thing" turns up INTEGRITY.

I'm all about Kitty and the Hellions. Kitty's best ffriends with one of them, but looks down on the group. Gold. Amd the Hellions are mostly alright kids who would like to get alopng with the Mutants, but tyheir Headmistress is a scheming bitch who pits them against Xavier.

I'm thinking of photocopying the cover of my New Mutants Graphic Novel and taping it over the Smallville cover for the duration of the game.<br/><br/>About the system: what AfT said, more or less. I like how A) You bhild characters by making statements about how they feel about stuff, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> You always roll "why I'm doing this" plus "who I'm doing it to/with/for." the rest is just window dressing for me.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, about people's specific Value suggestions:<br/><br/>A lot of these are something like what I've considered.

If someone wants to do the right thing, that's Justice. If someone wants to do the wrong thing, that's Justice. If someone wants vengeance, that's Justice. If someone wants to talk someone down from their vengeance, that's Justice. If some high school kid is screaming "That's SO not FAIR!", that's Justice. And if none of your high school characters ever scream "That's SO not FAIR", you're simply not doing the high school drama part right.<br/><br/>The fact that Justice and Vengeance are such a great pair is what makes it work so well as a value for Smallville. Scruples vs. Moral Flexibility is just straight up good and evil, lawful and chaotic. It's too black and white. But Vengeance is something that even boy scouts like Cyclops occasionally indulge in, right? And that's why it works so well.<br/><br/>As you've said, it's all in the statements. It's just as valid for someone to have a D10 Justice with "Everyone needs to follow the rules." or "Xavier knows what is best for us" as it is to use "Vengeance shall be mine!"<br/><br/>Oh. And just to point something out - you may want to have characters like Emma Frost or one of the Hellions as a PC. Smallville is built around that sort of conflict between the PCs. That's why Lex and Tess are designed as PCs.<br/><br/>So you might have the best results if you mix it up. Have one person play Emma. Have another play one of the Hellions. Have one or two playing New Mutants. And have another playing one of the older teacher mutants - preferably one who has a crush or an ex relationship with Emma or something.<br/><br/>You could skip the Emma thing, if she's really that evil (I'm not that familiar) and have a Hellion PC instead (again, preferably with a crush on a New Mutant). But having at least one PC who's from the "other side" is a really good idea in a Smallville game. It helps drive the deeply personal conflicts and the secret-keeping that the game is built for facilitating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311191/#Comment_311191" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T18:53:57+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  6:53PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had thought about having Hellion Leads in the mix, because yeah, juicy conflict, web of clashing priorities, etc. And we may be able to try that, still...we play tomorrow.

In other words, once the Mission Die is at d8, all the d6 and d4 relationships will fade a little. I haven't decided if this is a good thing or a bad thing yet.  Yes, that's when people "put aside their differences and take down the cosmic threat", but it's also when crucial relationships are themselves heightened.<br/><br/>Still thinking, working!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311194/#Comment_311194" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T19:03:50+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  7:03PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: you make a good point regarding JUSTICE.

So I wanted to try and accommodate that if possible. As it turns out, all but one player took Manifestation. Dani's player took Destiny, because he's going for an Indian Shaman thing with her that she tries to resist.

If I do include Linked Powers, I was thinking maybe each Mutant could have their own set of Linked powers, for purposes of D12 effects--like Rahne has Wolf Transformation, but her Linked Powers could be Enhanced Senses, Claws, etc and she could pull Effects from those?<br/><br/>So, looking over the relationship map and character sheets now, I think we need to just add a couple of tweaks to be complete--I'm going to give everyone a Mutant heritage for free, and probably fill in some Extras: Illyana, Doug, maybe Emma Frost, maybe Empath and Catspaw of the Hellions. I think we can just do entirely without Warlock, because we all hate him.*<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*I'm sorry if anyone is a fan of Warlock.**<br/><br/>**I mean I'm really, <i>really</i> sorry if you're a fan of Warlock. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311312/#Comment_311312" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T23:07:49+00:00" title="February  5, 2011 11:07PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's awesome to see this coming together for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a note, Lex is absolutely a Lead all the way up until around Season Seven. In Season Eight he's replaced by Tess, but Davis Bloome is also a Lead. Zod's a Lead in Season Nine. The game's built around the idea of the Leads and their Relationships driving all of the conflict, so if they're all getting along perfectly well and BFFs, nothing really happens. It'd all be external. So you have to make sure that rivalries, jealousy, unrequited love, phobias, and so forth are built into their Relationship and Value statements. Gives them all something to chew on.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311316/#Comment_311316" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T23:51:36+00:00" title="February  5, 2011 11:51PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>Dani's player took Destiny, because he's going for an Indian Shaman thing with her that she tries to resist.</blockquote>\nYa know, that might make Dani a character worth reading. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
