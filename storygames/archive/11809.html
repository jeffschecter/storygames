Not having played Mouse Guard or Burning Wheel,  I am wondering...  are there any specific points that  YOU  or your groups have hit in the rules that you've confused or made mistakes during games that would be handy to point out?  Are there any rules that you missed?  Things that were unclear at first?  Things you corrected?  Any difficult or confusing parts to specifically watch for?  Or any clarifications that could be handy from your point of view?<br/><br/><br/>I'd like to pay attention to anything that any of you have played and found,  so that I can be prepared better.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Beyond that...<br/>Does anyone have any LINKS to any reviews or  Actual Play  threads for Mouse Guard that might be helpful to read (or listen to, if podcast)?<br/><br/><br/>Thanks for the ideas.<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263937/#Comment_263937" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T14:16:17+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  2:16PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2010 2:18PM by RichD.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a ton of AP threads over on the Burning Wheel forum.

The concept of using a trait against yourself is also counter intuitive to many until they realize that the extra checks they get for the Player's Turn are pretty useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264093/#Comment_264093" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T15:23:25+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  3:23PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say don't stress about learning ALL the rules. Just play with the ones on the character sheet, and you can even skip the advancement rules as well. Once you get rolling with more sessions, then you can add cool stuff that you are excited about. <br><br>ALSO- Don't feel bad about flipping through the book to find something during the session, but make sure you limit it to 1-2 minutes each time. If you don't find it in that amount of time, wing it. Even the people who made the game keep it handy for reference.<br><br>PLAY PLAY PLAY it a bunch. <br/><br/>The Burning Wheel forums will cut right to the point with their advice.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264252/#Comment_264252" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T01:16:44+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  1:16AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>Beyond that...<br/>Does anyone have any LINKS to any reviews or  Actual Play  threads for Mouse Guard that might be helpful to read (or listen to, if podcast)?</blockquote>\nEpisode <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2349&amp;Mode=like">#49</a> of the <a href="http://www.havegameswilltravel.net/index.php?post_id=563204" rel="nofollow">Have Games, Will Travel</a> podcast discusses <i>Mouse Guard</i> in some depth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264469/#Comment_264469" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T06:00:44+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  6:00AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nature can be tricky.  Be well versed on how tapping nature works, as that is Mouse Guard's method to superpower their way through a challenging situation.  It comes up a lot, and you'll have to adjudicate what is within nature and what is outside of nature.  That can cause some disagreements at the table if you don't have a little discussion with the other players and get on the same page regarding the Nature of mice.<br/><br/>Really remind the players they need to earn checks.  I've had four or five games end with the players lamenting that they totally forgot to earn checks for the player's turn, and it soured the evening a bit.  Try to offer situations where they can, if they like, use their traits against them, or to benefit the GM, or when there is a tie, and be sure to bring it up throughout the GM's turn.  It can be quite easy to forget that they need those checks for the Player's turn.<br/><br/>Don't over-prepare GM turns.  You have Situation 1 and situation 2, then you can come up with one or two twists. Personally I like to come up with one twist, and have failing the other situation be success with a condition.  You don't need to go much further than that.  <br/><br/>I like to count out factors for difficulty out loud.  Recently, when they hit a swollen river the squad had to cross, I ticked off the reasons for the obstacle number. I find it keeps things transparent, I can parse through the difficulty easier, and it lets' the players know why the difficulties are the level they are.  It also paints a picture of what difficulties they have to deal with. "Base 1 to cross.  Add one cause it's raining, and one more cause the river's flooded, and one because of the territorial beavers lurking in the water, ferrying big logs of wood. Difficulty 4 total."<br/><br/>Print out the cards on the website, <a href="http://plainvanilla.typepad.com/soap/mouse-guard-cards.html" rel="nofollow">on the wiki over here</a>.  They are INCREDIBLY useful, and quite pretty.  The weapon cards especially, as they can change the rules of combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
