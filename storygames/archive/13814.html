She is short in her instructions, but clear. So she communicate very efficiently what we are to do, and leave us to follow her example. I find her short instructions, and silent example, to leave a space for me to go into, searching for the elusive flow in the balance and movements of the training.<br/><br/>I have another instructor, in yoga, and he is trying to aim for the same state of "meditation in motion". But he has the small flaw of talking too much. When he tells us to empty our minds, and "be only here and now", he can't stop talking. So he fills our minds, again and again, undermining the objective he has stated.<br/><br/>I've worked as a professional GM for 16 years, and have developed a lot in that time. I'm still not flawless in my leadership, but I'm a bit <i>simpler</i>. I tend to prefer a very short framing, when entering a new situation, "cutting to the chase" so to say, of the character-action.<br/><br/>And i believe this to be very effective, when done right, for the same reason that my flow-instructor makes it easier for me to get into flow in her training-sessions. Her leadership is simple and to the point, and leaves me with the necessary space to reach for my inner tranquility. <br/><br/>What a short and to-the-point framing do, in role-playing games, is to leave the players with a dramatic space, in which they reach for their inner understanding of the characters dilemma ...<br/><br/>- maybe.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_312726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312726/#Comment_312726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T14:48:28+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  2:48PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So; we keep the framing short and efficient, and then we go into interaction.

However, I've found, like you, that those can be established as needed.  The key is just that everyone <i>agrees</i> that it's needed.  If my players tend to ask questions before announcing character actions, all is well.  In Delve, I demand that they do, and the results are good.<br/><br/>Minimal framing + no instruction on fleshing out + no natural player urge to flesh out = non-agreed-upon fiction = chaos.  Ponderous scene framing is certainly better than <i>that</i>, so I remain a fan when other techniques aren't viable.<br/><br/>P.S. Graham, some of my best gaming has come right after sports!

That would be my default to try to move peoples headspaces away from sitting around a table.   Sure you can vary the pace of scene framing to match the pace of the action -- rely more on short cliches to convey information as economically as possible so as not to bog fast-paced scenes.  But I would go to that more as... I dont know the word - sub-scenes?  cutting from one action scene to another action scene within the same general situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_312964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312964/#Comment_312964" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T16:34:12+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  4:34PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>What does 'reigning authority tightly' mean?</blockquote>Not being overly eager to establish yourself in the game, holding your oratory back, giving the scene over to the interaction.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I think ritual is important, too.</blockquote>So do I. The whole damn thing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> a ritual. And by that ritual we make magic; a magic that mesmerize ourselves.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Minimal framing + no instruction on fleshing out + no natural player urge to flesh out = non-agreed-upon fiction = chaos.</blockquote>Exactly what are you describing here? Anything you have experienced?<br/><br/>The players ability to "flesh out" is inherent in his natural urge <i>to act</i>; when the player make his character act, it will have consequences, and the scene will blossom; there will be flesh, and blood, and gore a'plenty! And then; when you tie scene to scene to scene to scene, in a stream of hard knuckled drama, you will see scenes feeding each other, strengthening and deepening the plot, and the game will come alive like a roaring monster in your midst!<br/><br/>It sounds crazy, I know, but I believe most of us have witnessed the birth of that "monster" in the midst of a player circle. I certainly have, and more so since I began heeding the pace and rhythm of play, keeping my love for details away from my gaming. <b>The devil is NOT in the details!
