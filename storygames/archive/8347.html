For instance, I've been reading old AD&amp;D materials a lot lately, and here's my thinking:\n<ul>\n<li>One day I'm going to play the Dragonlance campaign. It will be bog serious, and I will provide the players with the option of playing the original heroes of the lance if they so choose. I've been collecting books with this in mind. I will use everything in the adventure material to the fullest extent applicable, including the scripted set-piece encounters as well as the strategic wilderness map navigation episodes. I even, just, might consider using the original rules system to properly get the "grandeur" of the game right, but likely I'll shirk and settle for the Solar System or some such - you know, something appropriate for a heroic epic. This will not prevent us from hacking in everything we need from AD&amp;D, including character classes and alignments.</li>\n<li>Planescape is a Whitewolf game that wants to be AD&amp;D. Playing it with the Storyteller system would be completely appropriate. You could also play plenty of games <i>in</i> the Planescape setting, but those wouldn't be able to use the adventure materials nearly so well. (Understand, with "Storyteller system" I refer to the methodology of storytelling GMing, not necessarily the dicing system and whatnot.)</li>\n<li>Traditional dungeon crawls should be played with systems that get them right. I wrote about <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/bull-dungeoneering/" rel="nofollow">my own thoughts on dungeoneering</a> just a couple of days ago. If I were to play something like the Tomb of Horrors, I would likely use a homebrew D&amp;D. Failing that (perhaps because I weren't me and didn't have a homebrew), I'd go for red box D&amp;D, Tunnels &amp; Trolls or Mazes &amp; Minotaurs, all games that I've read and appreciated for certain of their qualities.</li>\n</ul>\nHmm... looking at your exact situation with dungeon crawl plans and whatnot, I'd consider that new game Vincent is writing, Storming the Wizard's Tower. Might require some flexing, but at least it handles combat quickly. I would also recommend my D&amp;D homebrew, but it'll probably be a couple of years still before I get it to a productized shape. I wouldn't use Burning Wheel myself, as it'd be in intentional cross-purposes with the dungeon. Same goes for the Solar System - these choices make sense only as some sort of sly critique and commentary on the dungeon genre, not as functional choices for playing a dungeon crawl. Probably your best bet for a quick solution would be red box D&amp;D, but with combat hacked into a one-roll mechanic to cut down on the less than interesting skirmishing. (Not difficult to do, really - we can discuss that if you'd like.) You could also cut excess combat from the scenarios by hand in your role as the GM, but that might not be as satisfying.<br/><br/>Also, Elfs is an excellent choice I fully recommend, but as Moreno says, only if you don't mind mockery. Won't be my system of choice when I unleash the dragonwars on Krynn...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184487/#Comment_184487" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T07:15:25+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  7:15AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2008 7:18AM by Moreno R..">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>One day I'm going to play the Dragonlance campaign.

But I will persevere! Or alternatively, I will develop an acceptable, dynamic method for using the material without being bound to it. There are great tensions in my purpose, as I want to play through these historically important materials, but I have no need to do so with the gaming tools of the day if I can figure out the reasonable compromises. That's where Solar System comes in, the sort of fiction Dragonlance advocates comes out of SS quite naturally. The original Dragonlance adventures also feature an immense amount of overhead related to servicing old-school sandbox play, the sort of stuff that would be outright cut out of adventures written ten years later. This overhead can be turned into freedom when correctly utilized, it seems to me - I agree with you that those adventures are intended to be railroaded and hard, but the writing is stuck on the older models and thus supports some other notions as well.<br/><br/>The only downside to Solar System is that it'd require heavy modding to get it to do the dungeon crawl parts of the campaign. Dragonlance has quite a lot of dungeons in it, with plenty of random encounters and such. From that viewpoint it wouldn't be an entirely wrong-headed notion to use something like a heavily modified D&amp;D for it. Difficult to say when I'm not sure myself if I want to play through this massive campaign as a challenge proposition or for the storytelling opportunities. Sort of difficult to make use of everything in the campaign all at once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184499/#Comment_184499" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T09:06:18+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  9:06AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2008 9:07AM by akooser.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero has lots of good points.

The text is very intent on the player characters being free to live and die as the luck of the dice goes, but I'm not so sure that this is intended for real; at least the campaign provides no tools at all for replacing dead characters while being very big on tying the characters into the plot framework in a way that'd get ruined if characters died. So a bit of uncertainty there; perhaps the writers just couldn't verbalize the difference between dramatic deaths and meaningless deaths in the early '80s yet or something like that, considering that characters do die in the Dragonlance novels now and then, always in dramatic situations. For important NPCs there is something the text calls the "vague death clause" or some such - the GM has to insist that any important NPCs die in unconfirmable circumstances so that they can make a return appearance later in the plot with a pat explanation for their miraculous survival.<br/><br/>But that's Dragonlance, a fascinating body of roleplaying-related material. All D&amp;D settings are a sort like this, really - their siren song calls you to utilize the carefully imagined material for some epic adventuring, using your newfound wisdom and modern gaming technique to unleash the visions that perhaps might not have been done justice when they were published. I'm still going to play Planescape + Nine Worlds the moment I get the chance - the fit is obvious, pretty much the only change needed is to switch the attributes for the alignment poles, and you're set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184523/#Comment_184523" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T12:21:26+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 12:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2008 12:24PM by agony.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone.

I recently got my paws on the red box set after almost two decades (the Finnish version to boot, with the hilarious translations), so I've been leafing through it now and then during the last couple of weeks. As far as I perceive, the whole combat round system is not at all necessary for resource management purposes in the system as long as characters suffer some hp losses from combat. I might even say that the primary purpose of having combat rounds in the game at all is to allow the players to choose the right moment of retreat from combats that are going against them. The tactical options seem to be quite similar from fight to fight, and if the rules are to be believed, are not a central feature anyway.<br/><br/>So what I'd probably do if faced with running an interminable dungeon with this system would be to loan a page from TSoY and have all combats resolved with one roll, except allow players to go into a detailed combat if they're not happy with the one-roll resolution results. Perhaps something like a to-hit check vs. difficulty determined by the number of monster hit dice, and the degree of success determines how many hit points the characters lose. Maybe allow the players to distribute the hp loss in a somewhat coordinated manner... could be something like you take "dices of damage" according to your check result, and the players get to distribute the dice before they are rolled between the characters. Or if they screw up the initial check and would be taking too much damage to their liking, they could declare a cancel, let the monsters have the initiative and go through the fight in the normal manner. Or they could forego the right to the one-roll resolution to try to set up an ambush themselves. Maybe allow high-level fighters with combat powers to roll a pool and pick the highest result from two or three dice in the one-roll resolution to depict their increasing certainty and routine in trashing the random encounters.<br/><br/>Using something like that could be just the trick for running through these interminable dungeons that presumably have strategic application and resource management aspects, but are very slow to play through thanks to the filler encounters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
