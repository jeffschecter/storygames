For this purpose I thought up a lightweight, useful exercise from real world game design. As I've been discussing in the other thread, I think that the real stumbling block for formalized barter of work in a creative scene like this is that our needs for help are intermittent, occur randomly and differ widely in nature and seriousness. This makes for a very inflexible economy where currency circulates slowly and difficulty. For example, my exercise here is a bit of an artificial one in that if we weren't discussing Villages here, it wouldn't have occurred to me to seek outside help. I figure that it'll be useful for everybody to see how the system works, so as to enable us to decide whether it's worthwhile in the long term. Perhaps having an explicit currency encourages us to rely more on each other than we otherwise would, at least for those of us who usually work alone.<br/><br/>Before I explain the exercise I'm seeking help with, a paragraph about my game design project:<br/><br/>As many of you are probably aware, I have a particular albatross hanging around my neck in the form of a substantial game-writing grant that I received in 2008. The grant was for writing a radically beginner-friendly, all-ages roleplaying game called "Eleanor's Dream" for the Finnish market. Various matters (such as writing the third edition of TSoY, say) have delayed the project, but now it's finally coming to a finish after six different iterations on the game system and other associated shenanigans. Those who've been following the game's development may find it amusing that the final form has become what I myself characterize as "a narrativist OSR D&amp;D".<br/><br/>Another paragraph in fact, I need to explain what the game is about:<br/><br/>Eleanor's Dream is about people from our world (the players of the game, in fact) who travel to a wondrous fantasy world on the other side of the veil of imagination. Think Narnia, Ultima games, H.P. Lovecraft's Dreamlands, Burroughs Mars novels - there's a rich tradition in fantasy literature for this sort of thing. The other world of the game is a sort of fairy tale environment that I'm calling "Sariola" (a mythical land of the dawning sun in Nordic folklore). It's a world of talking animals, trolls, witches, princes and princesses, that sort of thing. Visitors from our world are known as "dreamwalkers" to the Sariolans, some of whom revere these visitors as angels or gods. What the dreamwalkers do in Sariola is pretty simple, as it should be for an all-ages roleplaying game: you explore the environment, encounter funny NPCs and perhaps resolve some problems in the best traditions of morning cartoons; what the game is "about" will pretty much depend on what the players want to do. I'm writing the setting in a pretty experimental manner that I hope facilitates use and makes the material flexible, enabling the playgroup to scale the material up or down depending on the player base. (I'm not much of a believer in dumbing down stuff for children, so I'm not particularly writing Sariola as a children's fantasy world - it's as adult as it needs to be.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386578/#Comment_386578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T11:45:50+00:00" title="August  7, 2012 11:45AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The exercise</b><br/><br/>A central part of my game relies on a rich, varied listing of what might be termed pre-prepared random encounters. Often enough these tie into the background setting, highlighting the people and the predominantly Finnish mythology of the place, but Sariola is in ready reach from all sorts of other dreamlands and fairy tale kingdoms as well, so all sorts of literary ideas and situations may be encountered during the game.<br/><br/>What I'd like help with is, I'd like you to write me some random encounters. The format is simple, just describe something that would be interesting and provocative to encounter on the road or in the wilderness, perhaps something that involves an in-built conflict, or that is universally interesting to us as human beings. These random encounters are basically Bangs much of the time, and they may or may not evolve into entire adventures in the game; that is entirely up to player engagement.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of examples of what I'm thinking of here:<br/><br/>*********************************<br/>Kastra Merga is a mermaid with tangled and salty hair. Kastra is lovelorn, but will only accept a "real" man to accompany her under the waves. Towards everybody else she tends to be sassy or grumpy. Friendship confuses Kastra, for she has never experienced any.<br/>*********************************<br/>An unicorn starts following the dreamwalkers. Country people hearing about it are likely to start an unwholesome hunt for it, using a young virgin as bait. Should the unicorn be left alone, it will come to the aid of the dreamwalker at a moment of need.<br/>*********************************<br/>Luikko is the ugliest man of his village, but also the bravest and smartest. He does not know this himself, for he has been the bottom rung of the local totem pole his entire life.<br/>*********************************<br/>There is a rumour about king Ka\u0161hei who built himself a grand mausoleum in between two mountains. As the story has it, Ka\u0161hei took a magical thing to his grave - pick something that would entice the players, or promise the feathered cloak of his swan-bride if nothing else occurs. The grave itself is a D&amp;D-style dungeon. 50% that Ka\u0161hei awaits on the bottom, immortal and insane, and 50% probability that his treasure is still there.<br/>*********************************<br/>Two or three witches or devils negotiating at crossroads at night. They will surely eat trespassers, but the cunning may hear powerful secrets.<br/>*********************************<br/>A great oxen has been stuck from its horns in a crack between two rocks. Locals know that it was put there by a passing dreamwalker. Should the oxen be freed, it is a most helpful and friendly being, but also hopelessly clumsy and stupid, causing trouble wherever it should follow you. Should the oxen find its place, it will provide its helpers with the luotteet (magic words) that will summon it to one's side.<br/>*********************************<br/>Hermann is a friendly Lappish man who will help travelers easily. He is also a cannibal. Furthermore, he knows a single magic song from when he ate sage.<br/>*********************************<br/>A weird man under a rainbow-colored umbrella sells powders from a small cart. His name is Nikitin Ne\xe5rk. Nikitin's powders turn you into various happy colors, but afterwards you lose your own color and become entirely grey.<br/>*********************************<br/><br/>As you can see, I'm working with a pretty flexible framework of possibilities here, especially as the game text is still evolving as I hone the formats and ideas involved. At this point the ideas are the important thing and not the format so much, as I'm going to expand and sharpen the individual notions every which way as I go along. Some of these will end up as one-paragraph or even one-sentence notes, while others I'll expand into half-page treatments or even a bit larger. The vast majority goes into the random encounter lists that the game relies on for "organic" content that has nothing to do with whatever storylines are currently running. Random shit for players to stumble over while on their way to save the princess or whatever they might be up to.<br/><br/>Note especially that any and all questions about whether my setting has dragonturtles are completely meaningless; let me worry about adapting this stuff for the game. It's a fantasy setting along the vein of the Hobbit, Chronicles of Prydain and so on, except built for roleplaying and therefore even more flexible and widely scoped. No need to try to be extra "Finnish" with your encounters - the setting is heavily influenced by Finnish folklore, but I have my own twists on it, and frankly I'm probably better situated to work that angle than most of you.<br/><br/>So there you have it, feel free to write up however many of these you'd please. Only submit your own original work, or ideas culled from public domain sources. I might or might not use any posted ideas in my book, but I'll attribute everybody as contributors all the same. There's no particular schedule on this, it's all basically background research that I'll cull and polish later on when it's time to make final determinations on what goes into the book and what doesn't.<br/><br/><b>I'm paying in hours</b><br/><br/>The point of the exercise, as we remember from the top. Anybody with a Villages account will get let's say .20 hours per idea - no triage on this, any good faith effort counts even if I don't find use for it in my project. We're going for quantity rather than quality here, as befits a brainstorming session. If you don't have an account yet feel free to start one for this (and let me know the name it's under if it's different from what you use here). Note that if you haven't endorsed me with hearts, then the hours might come via a third party. In the spirit of this exercise I'm not going to acknowledge untrusted hours at all, so if you haven't endorsed me or somebody who has endorsed me, then I guess I won't pay you at all. (If you came to this thread without going through the Villages thread, feel free to ask about how to set yourself up there. It's pretty simple, though, and the other thread explains it in depth.)<br/><br/>As you probably know if you've read that other thread, you can use the hours earned in this way to "buy" help from others involved. Perhaps something like what I'm trying here, or whatever. You might consider every .2 hours I give you to be a bit over ten minutes of my time on whatever you might need help on, except that you don't actually need to specifically use <i>my</i> help, you can instead hire somebody with actual skills. Just like money in that regard.<br/><br/>I'll reserve the right to call a stop to this if you guys create like a thousand encounter ideas for me and it seems like I'm getting into too much debt <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386582/#Comment_386582" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T12:29:54+00:00" title="August  7, 2012 12:29PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some goblins have set up a den out in the nearby forest where they sell things for the right price.

Some games have pretty in-depth systems for random story creation - <i>In a Wicked Age</i> being perhaps the most spectacular.<br/><br/>For the purposes of this project, though, craftsmanship is important. It might seem like I'm just collecting random dross here, but I'm going to sort and polish these to a level of quality that is impossible in cold randomization. I might include a layer of content randomization in the game, too, but I personally find that well-prepared encounters are a selling point that I want to offer to others as well.<br/><br/>(The key issue for my project is personal creativity: you or I are well able to use random tools for creativity, but the target audience of my game won't have the training. They'll appreciate thoroughly prepared adventure seeds all the more.)<br/><br/>That being said, by all means field-test your system here!

If the players can sneak to the edge of the clearing (an easy task), they'll be surprised to discover a bear, a badger, and a couple of foxes, as well as other woodland creatures playing folk music with human instruments and dancing in a circle.

Let's see what does it spit out:<br/><br/>-Players are told that the only way to prevent a war among two powerful Greenfolk tribes is to find the Walking Forest, a huge living colony of plants governed by a colective intelligence, that wanders the southern rainforests. Because yeah, the best place for a forest to hide is into another forest. Properly convinced, the Forest will be able to steal all the magic weapons of the Greenfolk at once, the only way to prevent them from using their magicks.<br/><br/>-Surprised by an incredibly cold snowstorm, players become in debt with an old fire elemental and now have to rescue his son, imprisioned by Steelfolk inside a mountain. If they don't free the son of the elemental before the 12 candles in his cave are consumed, they will lose the heat of their bodies forever. One part of them becomes stone for each hour that passes to remind them of the deal they have made.<br/><br/>-Players are caught in the middle of a fight between necromancers and a stone giant. The latter only seems to be defending his territory and doesn't pursue the necromancers, while these will try any dirty trick and even enlist the players to destroy the giant. The necromances however have made a vow of silence and won't explain the reason for this fight. The truth is that the giant was <br/>so obssesedly in love with the necromancer's queen that ended killing her, and now refuses to leave her body and the sacred burial site the necromancers were planning to use to bring her back.<br/><br/>-A misterious hunchbacked musician will capture the players in a golden illusory maze until they acknowledge her talent. As the players wander through the maze, the musician will use their magicks to make it appear the highest skill or attribute of each PC as something that will make the rest of the players envious, making them fight and argue between themselves.<br/><br/>-The PCs are mistaken for revolutionary leaders. Townsmen have been waiting five months for their arrival, to lead them into a revolt to liberate the town from their leader, a corrupt ice wyrm that has denied them the winter for 8 years. Imagine the world without winter, how awful spring is when it has to flourish over the carcasses of auttum, how everything rottens even before summer and how populated are the forests since all creatures have plenty of food all year long, etc, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387046/#Comment_387046" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T05:07:30+00:00" title="August 14, 2012  5:07AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2012 9:07AM by Davide Losito.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - In a desert oasis, the most beautiful flower of all times as blossomed.<br/>It is a magic flower that may preserve peace among the desert tribes.<br/>The problem is that it is draining the oasis dry, because it needs all the water of all times to sustain itself.<br/>Emissaries of all the desert tribes are debating what to do and players are asked to solve the issue.<br/><br/>- The people from the High Mountain - apes-men with eyes as lucid as mirrors - has build the Bridge to the Stars: a magical device that may bring them <i>on the other side of the veil of imagination</i> in the effort of contacting the Gods from Beyond, the Dreamwalkers who don't walk on Sariola.<br/>This will grant a permanent passage between the two worlds, in both ways.<br/>The Dark Kingdom of Deep Beneath is planning to conquer the Bridge and assault the real world.<br/><br/>- The Dreamwalkers are spreading the flu virus to the Sariolans.

If they players bite, and get into the spirit of the argument instead of just blithely accepting his outrageous prices, the merchant will at some point drop suddenly and irrevocably dead.<br/><br/>-A Wanted poster with a face that changes randomly every day to defame a new villager or out-of-towner (such as a PC).  If town guards learn about it and try to remove or destroy it, or design their official posters differently, it just pops up in a different place, and adapts to changes.<br/><br/>-A ruined machinist's guild tower, occupied by monstrous but friendly semi-intelligent creatures who worship the ruined equipment.  They would undoubtedly be ever so grateful if the players would fix it for them... or would they?  If the players, frightened by their appearance, attack without asking further questions, the creatures are easily defeated.  However, each is capable of casting a curse in its death throes, trapping its killer in the machine it loved and worshiped most.<br/><br/>-A peaceful, pastoral village; a terrible discovery.  In the dead of night, the entire graveyard was excavated, the corpses spirited away.  Oddly enough, the burial riches were left in neat little piles on the former gravesites.  A thorough inspection of the area might turn up a silver brooch; a skull flanked with mechanical wings.  It will stand out from the surrounding burial treasure.  The next day, the the bodies rain down on the village from a terrible, unseen height.<br/><br/>-The player group's exploits have gained them some modicum of fame, and they have a keep or land-base over which they preside.  The base has attracted some commoners interested in working the land or setting up shop.  One day, a notorious hedge knight rides into the fledgling village, accompanied by a wizened old noble of foreign, unknown lineage.  He declares loudly to all and sundry that he is holding the entire town's population ransom.  Most of the commoners and watchmen will look to the surrounding fields for signs of an army, and then laugh at the knight, thinking "Old Worm has finally lost it," or something along those lines.  Then, the wizened old man's skin starts sloughing off, and his wicked smile grows...<br/><br/>*EDIT* Joachim Heise on villages                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387096/#Comment_387096" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T14:36:57+00:00" title="August 14, 2012  2:36PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And Joachim's paid.
