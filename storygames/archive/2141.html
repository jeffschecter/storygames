                    So this is something that I'm seeing more and more of, which may be that it's showing up more often or I'm just noticing it more.<br/><br/>I see folks ask questions, and then other people answer with this syllogism-thing that goes "Since Roleplaying is X, therefore Y."   A lot of times, the question is about a game under development, so the designer is asking things like, "How should I structure the skill list for Hippo Ninjas on Mars?" and he gets responses like "Well, since roleplaying is making the characters confront difficult moral challenges, the skill list should be organized along the kinds of moral challenges they'll be facing."  There's the alternate version that goes, "Well, since roleplaying is an exercise in player creativity loosely based on the material provided, the skill list should be open and flexible so that the players can do anything they want with it."  What I don't see a lot of is basing the answer on the design intents of the game-in-question, or when that isn't available, the asking of clarifying questions like, "Well, what do the Hippo Ninjas <em>do</em> on Mars?"<br/><br/>I also see a sort of related phenomenon where a design is criticized as not supporting what roleplaying "is."  This goes something like, "Design Y is no good because roleplaying is X and the design doesn't do that."  The reverse, "Design Y does not do X and therefore the game is supposed to be something other than X" doesn't seem to be considered, since the axiom Roleplaying=X doesn't seem to be questioned.<br/><br/>Over here in my little world, every game is played differently, has different emphases, inclusions, and exclusions, and each game produces a different experience.  A game is a roleplaying game not because the experience it produces is similar to other roleplaying games, but because the tools and techniques that it uses to create that experience is similar to other roleplaying games' techniques and tools.  If a new game produces the same exact results as another game I already have, why do I want that new game?  And yet it seems a great deal of discussion seems to orbit around making different games produce experiences that fall into some sort of canonical and approved box.<br/><br/>A lot of this stems from identity politics, which is like our community's foot fungus: annoying and recurrent.  We seem to be constantly stuck on defining who we as a group are for reasons that are murky at best: out of some fear of exclusion or something, I'm guessing (see all the "geeky" threads in the last month). In the quest to assure ourselves we're all in the group, we're trampling on the idiosyncracies of our individual experiences.  I enjoyed my game because I got to really get into my character, and you enjoyed your game so it must have been because you really got into your character, because we're all doing the same thing, right?<br/><br/>It's slightly ridiculous, but it takes no small amount of courage to say, "This game that I'm excited about is not all things to all people."  I don't know why it's so hard, but it is.  It's especially ridiculous because if you're all excited about it, you're presumably excited about it for specific reasons.  But so often that it's rather disturbing, the specific reasons and specific effects that get us so fired up about a game get glossed over when we try and share our enthusiasm.  Instead we try to show how the game has some sort of broad-based mass appeal, which often has little to do with the specific things we liked.  At best, we're a little disingenuous; at worst we're misrepresenting ourselves: lying, in simpler terms.<br/><br/>Why can't games be idiosyncratic and unique?  Why can't different designs produce different effects, and be appreciated for their different effects?  Why can't we say, "That doesn't sound like the thing that I find personally gratifying, but it's fascinating nonetheless."  Why do we trample on specifics in favor of shoehorning everything into one box or another?<br/><br/>I'd really like to hear what you liked in your recent game experience or book purchase or IM chat or whatever.  I really don't want you to pitch it to me; I really don't want you to explain how the individual experience or individual artifact is a member of a larger group of experiences or artifacts.  I don't care.  If you tell me what is actually engaging and entertaining you, you're telling me way more than if you try to make your play sound as awesome as it felt.  In fact, that sort of personal account is probably more likely to sell me on that game than any sort of pitch would.<br/><br/>However, I'm just one poster here, so maybe I'm going contrary to the desired flow around here and other folks really want to connect experience A and experience B to contextualize them and draw some sort of conclusions.  Maybe I'm totally off my rocker and missing something essential to the discussions that are taking place.  Maybe there's some value in "what you describe does not fit my personal definition of roleplaying which I am not interested in questioning at the moment."  So tell me, Story Games: am I missing something?  Or can we appreciate our games without stripping them of their individuality?  Can we appreciate games and designs as things unto themselves, rather than insisting that they fit in?                </div>

                            If I understand your question, you're saying "tell me what was cool recently", divorced from the question "what is role-playing".<br/><br/>So here's an experience that knocked my socks off recently. I pulled out my game Mathematica for playtest. One of the stated goals is to make philosophical, ethical, and religious questions part of what's in play at the table (note that my players gleefuly tore my mehcanics for this apart and put them back together in another form at the start of play). About halfway through the playtest, the game was interrupted by a 20 minute discussion of atheism, religion, and whether religions are able to answer their own burning questions effectively. That was a blow-me-away-cool moment which had squat to do with role-playing. To clarify: role-playing isn't a philosophical discussion, but on this night role-playing and philosophical discussion both happened at the table.<br/><br/>Regarding the problem of role-playing as an elephant, I think everyone tends to get blinkered into seeing role-playing defined by their current project. It's natural to see everyone else's project in terms of the problems you're struggling with right now. That's a natural tendency we all just need to be aware of and try to correct in ourselves (IMHO).                        </div>

                            Yeah, Joshua, I see it on all sides: It happens with feedback on the Forge, feedback in the game design section of RPGNet.  It happens in reviews of games, hell it's the reason that we had all those "Is it an RPG or Not?" discussions at RPGNet that led to the whole birth (from Clinton) of the word "Story Game", as kind of a "Fuck Off; I'm tired of playing this semantics game" exercise.<br/><br/>It's not anything to blame a community for (like, in the above I'm not saying anything about "The Forge" as an entity). And most of the people doing it probably don't even notice their own behavior. Or are total cocks about 'what is and isn't an RPG', and can't be helped anyway.<br/><br/>But yeah, being aware of it is good. If nothing else, we can jump in and ask better question that don't presuppose that the designer doesn't know what he really wants.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.myteespot.com/images/thumbs/t_6513_01.jpg"/><br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: Plus, what Tony just said there.<br/><br/>It might just take a gentle reminder that "What you want out of a game may not be what SHE wants out of a game".  Not in this whole relativist BS way or anything like that, but rather just to make people aware. And then not to derail, further add some relevant questions to find out where the poster wants to go with it.                        </div>

That's right.  Bring it.<br/><br/>I assume you meant <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/2022/calibrating-thematic-opposition/#Item_50" rel="nofollow">this comment?</a>  First, I stand by it, and I'll reply to your reply there, here.  Secondly, I'm bemused that you're pointing to me as a counterpoint, when I see a lot of overlap between your "Roleplaying is not the same for everyone" premise and my assertion that certain GMing tools have their place, but that I've read suggestions that they're The Way.  (I'll grant, maybe I read too much into the assertions I saw, but...)
<blockquote><cite>By Joshua BishopRoby in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/2022/calibrating-thematic-opposition/#Item_52" rel="nofollow">Calibrating Thematic Opposition</a></cite><br/>Could you play a game with solar steamers, ether gadgetry, and the Royal Astronomical Navy that doesn't involve driven characters discharging their responsibilities in complicated situations? Sure. I'm just not sure if that would be Full Light, Full Steam anymore. It very well may be lots of fun, just like bouncing a basketball against a wall and trying to get it past your friend might be fun but not be basketball.<br/></blockquote>
Do I understand you to mean that if I get together a bunch of players, and we talk out making characters, and I look at their batteries and skills and stuff, but that when I'm coming up with the night's entertainment I ignore the Situation Engineering chapter, and instead employ the skills I've developed as a GM, then what we will then be playing will not be <cite>Full Light Full Steam?</cite> <br/><br/>Now, I can understand that if I try to run FLFS as if it were D&amp;D, or <cite>Space: 1889,</cite> I've opened the case and voided my warranty.  But even so, I'm prone to argue that maybe as a GM, I know what my players and I want from a role-playing experience, and that it's almost impossible for a ruleset to produce a better experience for a table than <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">an experienced GM</span> the players can.  Pretty much as an extension of your premise in this thread.<br/><br/>But to the point, with even a little grounding in FLFS - like a con session with someone else who'se played it (or having play tested with the designer) - it seems like I could jump out of Situation Engineering, and directly apply my own skills and still come up with very FLFS-ish situations.  Granted: the only benefit might be my own improved enjoyment of the prep work, but I suspect there might be other benefits as well.                        </div>

I wonder if it's because people were getting nervous that a silly game called "The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!" was being made, and they wanted to stick a little 'real issue' in there because they were nervous that folks might see it as a shot at mocking homosexuals unless that serious/biting satire was in there?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Do I understand you to mean that if I get together a bunch of players, and we talk out making characters, and I look at their batteries and skills and stuff, but that when I'm coming up with the night's entertainment I ignore the Situation Engineering chapter, and instead employ the skills I've developed as a GM, then what we will then be playing will not be <cite>Full Light Full Steam?</cite></blockquote>
Yes.  It will be something similar, sure, but it won't be "proper" <em>FLFS</em>, just as <em>Dogs</em> with a Town the GM "just made up" won't be proper <em>Dogs</em>, and <em>Sorcerer</em> without using the back side of the character sheet won't be proper <em>Sorcerer</em>.<br/><br/>It's a question of what constitutes the game, and what features a given instance of play requires in order to 'count' as a game of <em>FLFS</em> (or whatever other title you want to insert there).  In the case of my game, the essential features aren't really the steam-powered etherships, the analytical engines, or the British navy.  Among other things, those bits aren't mine; they're salvaged from other works and history.  The thing that's "mine" and the thing that is what makes <em>FLFS FLFS</em> is the relationships between those elements: in other words, the combination of character creation, situation creation, and resolution mechanics.  Those three 'chunks' of system work together to produce an experience of certain specific characteristics.<br/><br/>Can you replicate that experience using other tools?  Sure.  Just like you can replicate the set of cabinets that you get by following the instructions of a kit.  That doesn't really make the two sets of cabinets "the same."  It makes them similar.  Which is splitting hairs, sure.<br/><br/>The important thing to me is that I don't write and then go through the trouble of publishing a game so that players can do exactly what they've already been doing except with steam, ether, and Britishisms.  My intent (as much as authorial intent matters) is to guide players to create a new and fundamentally different experience  So if you get together a bunch of players to play <em>FLFS</em>, I would hope that you'd give the game as written a try since that's why I published the book.  If you want to go all JDCorley on the game and change up how things work, that's certainly your perogative, and thank you for your thirty bucks.  I certainly can't stop you and I wouldn't want to.  In my humble opinion, though, you're missing out on an opportunity to try something different, something that you might enjoy more than your usual fare.  Or maybe it'll be something that's a nice change of pace.  Maybe you think it sucks.  The important thing for me, though, is that it's something new and different, and if you strip out the stuff that's foreign to your usual play style, it won't be new and different, it will be the Weekly Game with some steampunk paint splashed on top of it.<br/><br/>I talk about "rack shots" and "smash cuts" in <em>PTA</em> and not in other games, too, for the same reasons.  <em>PTA</em> is the game of making your own television show.  Other games aren't.  So when playing <em>PTA</em> I talk the teevee talk.  When playing Dogs I talk the fallout talk.  And so on.<br/><br/>Making any sense?                        </div>

I for one was just making an aesthetic opinion statement.  On reflection, my biggest issue was not seeing why with the gayness.  If I recall correctly, the whole idea came out of a different thread, but the tone and details read a lot like the Adam West Batman show, so the premise came on like a floppy cock in the middle of my 5p comic book.  I had a hard time getting past that to make any other criticism.<br/><br/>And maybe that's a further insight into what makes useful criticism here.  Presented with TGRSWU!, I inferred that Graham really liked the gayness, but personally wouldn't have written it (and wouldn't play it) as a goofy romp.  So, should I have opted out, rather than give the impression that Graham's design was Not What an RPG Should Be?  My impression of Graham is that he knows his own mind, and has a lot of design integrity; in short, he's punk rock.   So my criticism came out pretty unvarnished.                        </div>

I think that's definitely splitting hairs.  And from the perspective of a designer looking at a games table he's not sitting at, it's like splitting hairs with a Buick.  By giving instructions over the phone.<br/><br/>Because, seems to me, the idea that if I don't use the situation creation mechanics for a game <em>as written,</em> then I'm not playing the game is based on the premise that system and ruleset are the same.  I'd posit that I could sit down with some folks and recreate the FLFS experience without using the situation creation mechanics better than at least one table who has only ever read the book and tries to follow the ruleset to the letter.<br/><br/>And I think the cabinets example is a really good one.  If I've never seen a set of cabinets before, flatpack from Ikea not only gets me a set of cabinets, but gives me the best possible idea what cabinets are like.  But a skilled carpenter is going to be able to put together cabinets, or a rolltop desk, or a swingset with pretty much the same tools and material.<br/><br/>Point being: by discarding Situation Engineering, I don't think you can say for certain that I'm not playing FLFS.  I could still be making cabinets.  And while Situation Engineering can show me the cabinets you had in mind, and reliably produce cabinets, there are, I think, skills that I can use to produce situations that are still FLFS, but that would lie outside the comfortable scope of Situation Engineering.  So while the situation mechanics of a game are useful, they aren't the be-all-end-all of how that game can work, even staying within the bounds of the game.  <br/><br/>So, I find it interesting that you'll take the side that "not situation mechanics, not the game" in your own discussion about "Roleplaying is X," if that's not too broad an analogy.                        </div>

The point I'm trying to get at is that using a definition of "roleplaying" and applying it to every game you play regardless of the specific features of that particular game as written is missing out on those features.  I have significantly less of a problem with every instance of <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> sharing features that come from the book titled <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.<br/><br/>Could there be another instance of play that had a different set of features?  Certainly.  Would it be <em>FLFS</em>?  Not exactly.  But it would still be roleplaying, and potentially fun and entertaining and all that.  It could cause people to fall in love, cure syphillis, and save the world.  But at that point it's way the hell more your thing than my thing, and <em>FLFS</em> is more properly an inspiration for that game than the game being played.  So good on you for curing syphillis with a game you built with pieces found elsewhere.<br/><br/>John Wick has a book called <em>Play Dirty</em> that is all GM Advice.  It's applicable to any game with a traditional GM.  But <em>Play Dirty</em> is not a game itself; it's a collection of techniques and strategies.  A game takes a set of techniques and relates them to each other.  Changing the techniques, or changing the relationship of those techniques to each other, changes the game.  Whether or not that warrants using a different word to describe the experience is pretty irrelevant, here.  The game has been changed.<br/><br/>If you buy and play games to try new and different play experiences, changing the game to be more familiar directly undermines that goal.  If you don't want new and different play experiences, why are you buying and playing new games?  Why not stick with Story Engine or the Pool or Sorcerer or whatever your system-of-choice is?<br/><br/>If your answer is "Because I want to pick and choose the pieces of the games I play for my own purposes," then how is that answer different than saying, "Roleplaying is an exercise in player creativity loosely based on the material provided?"                        </div>

                            I don't think that a designer having pride in his game such that he wants for people to try it as written is, in fact, all that political. I mean let's get down to what's really going on here. Whether or not it's "playing the game" is irrellevant semantics. JBR is, in fact, saying that he'd like for people to try he game as designed. But I don't think that's at all comparable to somebody who says that all RPGs are X. I don't think that Josh would tell you that you should use Situation Engineering for your D&amp;D game.<br/>
<br/>
Consider that, if you're saying that JBR is saying that the way he's advocating to play is "One True Way" then that means that you saying that you want to play every game by your own methods is also "One True Way" in exactly the same way. But neither are. These are both local cases. He's saying "please try my game this one way." And you're saying, "I like to play the way I like to play."<br/>
<br/>
Neither of you is saying, "Everybody should play all RPGs X way all the time." Which is what the thread is about, if I'm not mistaken.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite><br>I see folks ask questions, and then other people answer with this syllogism-thing that goes "Since Roleplaying is X, therefore Y." A lot of times, the question is about a game under development, so the designer is asking things like, "How should I structure the skill list for Hippo Ninjas on Mars?" and he gets responses like "Well, since roleplaying is making the characters confront difficult moral challenges, the skill list should be organized along the kinds of moral challenges they'll be facing." There's the alternate version that goes, "Well, since roleplaying is an exercise in player creativity loosely based on the material provided, the skill list should be open and flexible so that the players can do anything they want with it." What I don't see a lot of is basing the answer on the design intents of the game-in-question, or when that isn't available, the asking of clarifying questions like, "Well, what do the Hippo Ninjas<em>do</em>on Mars?"<br/></br></blockquote>
Just a thought: it's <i>hard</i> to pin down your thoughts in this way.  When I follow game design threads, I see lots of folks post an idea, and then selectively not respond to these kinds of questions and instead follow other paths of discussion.  I think of a lot of game design threads are really designers thinking out loud, as it were.                        </div>

If you're a composer and you write a song with a bass line, a skilled bass player may be able to replace that with something that they know their particular audience will like better.  That's great for the audience, but the composer might reasonably respond with "all right, I'm glad you did that for that audience's sake, but you weren't playing the song I wrote, and I'd love it if you tried playing the song I wrote sometime and tell me how it goes; I think you might like it."<br/>
<br/>
Analogies between RPGs and other artforms are always fraught with flaws.  I expect this one is too.  Just sayin'.                        </div>

I'll admit to a whole heaping tablespoon of devils advocacy here.  I do think that a designer (any designer) only has a reasonable expectation of "shared features," certainly not all the shared features he intended.  I hope no one has gotten the impression (although Mike seems to have, to my dismay) that I don't think anyone should <em>try</em> Situation Engineering, or even that, for my first games of <cite>FLFS</cite> I will chuck those rules immediately.  I do think situation mechanics <em>as a class</em> serve the purpose of illustrating the designer's vision of how the game should be played very well - possibly even optimally.  I'm not convinced that the best games of <cite>FLFS</cite> ever will be played based on Situation Engineering, by analogy to flatpack furniture, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Now, I do feel like this discussion kind of derailed your original point though, about implicit dogmatism about role playing games.  I only brought it here because you referenced it, so now that I think it's been laid out about as clearly as it can be - we've got polarization and everything! - how does it figure in your original point?                        </div>

Without sounding <em>too</em> much like a grumpy designer with a bruised ego, here, it figures into my point like so: let games be themselves before you jam them into preconceived shapes.<br/><br/>In my case, play the game with Situation Engineering.  Give it a feel.  Chances are, with a couple iterations through the process, it will become more like guidelines than railroad tracks, providing the GM a structure within which to exercise his creativity.  So too, try playing <em>PTA</em> by describing the camera angles and cuts and whatnot, and use those nifty click-n-locks with <em>Capes</em> rather than immediately making your own, and rewriting the Drives to something you think -- without any experience of the default -- will better support what roleplaying "really is".                        </div>

Aha!  In that case, I'll mention that it was never my intention to say that the games shouldn't have a chance to be themselves.  <br/><br/>What I was saying is: I see a lot of end-to-end situation kits, ("a lot" being SE for FLFS, Town Creation for <cite>Dogs</cite> and R-Maps for everything) which I liken to Ikea furniture: quick to set up, and the result is an excellent model for future situations, but not the be-all-end-all of situation design.  I do not see a lot of tools to do situation design at home.  Where are the routers, the aggressive toothed saws, the drill presses, the dove-tailers and arc welders of situation design?  <br/><br/>I know situation mechanics get you excited, and I'm all for that.  Categorically agreeing that situation mechanics rock hardcore.  Not trashing Situation Engineering by a long shot: I think it rocks.                        </div>

                            See, I find the situation creation mechanics that are designed for specific games (<em>Dogs</em>, <em>FLFS</em>, <em>Grey Ranks</em>) to be part and parcel of the games they're included in.  If you're playing that game, you're using those mechanics.  The "R-Maps for everything" thing annoys the hell out of me.  Ron likes situations based on intimate, familial ties, and they're central to Sorcerer and Sex&amp;Sorcery (if one considers those separate designs).  The assumption that those situations are appropriate for "everything" is the bit that sticks in my craw.  An R-Map would be a very poor fit for <em>FLFS</em> because it would strain credibility that all the principal characters on a spaceship have these densely interwoven families and sexual associations (forestalling the obvious objection, even <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> doesn't reach the sort of connection-density of a typical R-map).<br/><br/>Situation mechanics don't get me excited on their own; situation mechanics <em>specifically built for the games they are a part of</em> get me excited.<br/><br/>The absence of situation mechanics in games annoys me, because the underlying assumption seems to be, "Well, since roleplaying is all pretty much the same thing, you already know how to create an appropriate situation for this game that you've never played before, right?"<br/><br/>I really don't get what you're looking for in your "routers, aggressive toothed saws, drill presses, and arc welders" comment.  Would you want the same sort of thing for character creation mechanics, resolution systems, character advancement?                        </div>

Yeah, kinda.  Mostly because SE/TC style situation mechanics aren't too much like character creation mechanics.  I'm reducing for simplicity, but I think everything I'm about to say goes for resolution, advancement, etc.<br/><br/>When you're using a character creation mechanic, the output needs to fit on a character sheet.  A list of traits, with numbers associated - or ranks or just binary existence - that will matter mechanically later on.  In parallel we discuss what kind of a guy this character is in terms of back story, or goals, or affectations etc.  And some games tie those ideas closer to the character sheet than others, but ultimately there's a character-story-thing that isn't really on the sheet.  Witness the phenomenon of two players playing the same pregen in completely different ways.<br/><br/>To my mind, situations, as created by SE, or towns from <cite>Dogs</cite> are more like that character-story-thing.  To pin the example down a bit, the NPC generator mechanics from <cite>Dogs</cite> is a closer match to chargen than the actual Town Creation rules.  edit: Or the original numinous idea of a way of calibrating challenges.<br/><br/>The analogy from my experience is the software engineering that I sneered at in my undergraduate career (because the prof was awful) but that's become my fascination in my professional life.  Design patterns, coupling and cohesion, software coverage, software metrics, UML, design processes: these are the tools in the IT domain that I'm looking for in the story domain.  Or Go proverbs: <i>"hane</i> at the head of two" and the like.  Decent rules of thumb and shorthand guideposts towards successful play.<br/><br/>Flagging is the only strong example that leaps to mind.  Explicitly or implicitly, players mark up areas that they want to see visited, and a well visited flag is a good thing.  There are plenty of just-fiction techniques that spring to mind from my high school English classes.  And while I can see how a game could and should introduce these ideas, and contextualize them to each other in the form of the game, I'm not sure that really useful tools would belong exclusively to a particular game, the same way whether you call her the Referee, Story Guide, Moderator, Control, Storyteller, DM, Hollyhock God or Keeper, that's a game master.                        </div>

I'm more persuaded when you say that nothing should be left-out when playing a given game,<br/>than when you say that games should be played without contamination from other games.<br/><br/>Miscegenation is inevitable.

                            Judson, I'm skeptical of the existence of generalisms for successful roleplaying, and I think this gets back to how we group roleplaying games, which I touched on earlier.<br/><br/>As far as I can see, the set of things we call roleplaying games are games which share similar <em>techniques</em> and produce rather dissimilar <em>results</em>.  The core shared technique is playing a role: making decisions for a fictional character and assuming that your real-world decisions direct the actions of the fictional character.  Other common techniques include rating character competency, rolling dice, and investing greater power in one player at the table.  It's the tools that are used that make an activity a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>When we start talking about "rules of thumb and shorthand guideposts towards successful play" we're bridging the gap between the techniques used and the results produced.  That's the "successful play" bit.  The thing is, in order to articulate those rules of thumb, we have to define successful play.  For general rules of thumb, we need generally defined successful play.  When we create some generalized definition of successful play, we kill the appreciation of individual experiences: they're either successful or unsuccessful, based on some outside criteria.<br/><br/>To continue the carpentry metaphor, there are no general rules of thumb for successful carpentry; there are, however, general rules of thumb for successful carpentry <em>of a particular school or style</em>.  Do you expose the dovetails or hide them?  Depends on whether you're doing baroque or craftsman carpentry.  So too I see value in general rules of thumb for particular styles of play.  Maybe you could use creative agendas here and talk about general rules of thumb for narrativist play, but I find the CAs a little too reductive.  I prefer to consider each game as a different style of play, a different experience to be had.<br/><br/>Curly, I agree with you in large part.  The only "problem" with importing techniques from one game into another is that it's very easy to replace elements of the game rather than supplement them.  If you imported fallout into <em>PTA</em>, you'd end up with tons of traits on your Protagonist sheet, and activating them all would foul up the resolution system.  Get what I'm saying?  By no means am I saying it's impossible or verboten, but I am saying that doing so introduces some risk of trampling the original game's intended design and operation.                        </div>

                            It's funny, but I think that the R-map is the router, just as flagging is the circlular saw. That is, I think we do have some of these tools. And that they can be very useful, but only as useful as, say, a router is. That is, not always useful, but useful when it's the right tool.<br/>
<br/>
Do we have the drill press and arc welder techniques yet? Probably not. But I agree we should get there.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that game-specific tools, and more generic tools preclude the usefulness of each other. Situation Engineering is like a biscuit joiner - only good specifically for making drawers. But excellent for that. Sure you can use a chisel or some other method to make your own drawers, and they might be excellent drawers too. But I don't think there's anything wrong with using the biscuit joiner either. Understanding that it's no good for hammering in nails.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see anyone disagreeing here. Providing a tool in a game is... well game design. It's no more saying that there's one true way to play to have situation engineering than it is to have hit points in the game.<br/>
<br/>
This is a far cry different from the topic of the thread which was like somebody saying, "Your game is all wrong because it doesn't have Situation Engineering or something like it" under the assumption that FLFS's projected method of play is how all RPGs should play. That's what's wrong. Having a desing that says, "Here, this is one cool way to play!" is not trying to force everyone to play that way.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, Judson, the designer being absent once the game is in the player's hands, it's not like they can say that anyhow. If asked, all they can say is, "Well I designed it to work as written, so I'd suggest trying it that way." Which is a far cry from, "If you play it other than as written, you can't have fun!"<br/>

Okay, but <em>regardless</em> of the style of furniture a craftsman as working towards, he should cut dovetails at a 1:6 angle for soft woods and a 1:8 angle for hardwood.  I think that there are guides like that for role play.  (Incidentally, "playing a role" isn't the kind of technique I'm trying to talk about.)

Mike has a very good point that tools are useful for certain purposes, with some being more specialized that others.  So, I'd grant that there certainly tools that are more useful for certain styles (or, I suppose, certain CAs) than others.  But I also think there are useful skills that we can learn and apply to role playing games as a class, the same way that we can learn skills that apply to board games, as a class, (like thing moves into the future, or evaluating the value of a move.)                        </div>

  You know, when I posted that thread on<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/1957/the-gay-recruitment-squad-wants-you-a-really-early-draft/" rel="nofollow">The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!</a>, I was surprised how many people suggested I make it a biting, satirical game which dealt with real issues. Even though, from the title and the text, it was pretty clear I wanted a stupid parodic romp.</br></p>
<p>Posted By: Andy<br>
  I wonder if it's because people were getting nervous that a silly game called "The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!" was being made, and they wanted to stick a little 'real issue' in there because they were nervous that folks might see it as a shot at mocking homosexuals unless that serious/biting satire was in there?</br></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>"Folks might see?"</p>
<p><em>I</em> see it as one of two things: making fun of fags (which I don't think Graham was doing, and hence my participation in the thread) or making fun of homophobes. You can't make a lighthearted romp about a topic that people really care about and die over, and expect the game to not raise the issue at its core. It can be funniness about homosexuality and/or funniness about homophobia, but it's going to be about those things. Springtime FÃ¼r Hitler is funny in retrospect about WWII and the Holocaust. If I didn't have strong feelings about those things, it wouldn't be funny. Like, if it was about Napoleon instead of Hitler,  the joke wouldn't work as well because I don't have strong feelings about Napoleon, and I bet that's a fairly common perspective.</p>
<p>Graham, man, you chose the topic because it's a meaningful topic that you can address with wigs and Donna Summer. Not because wigs and Donna Summer are funny but devoid of meaning.</p>
