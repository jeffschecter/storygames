Chris and I have decided to split the constraints between us and I took the mantle of "No Character Generation".  While I have a couple of Ideas about this, I was wondering what the extremes were in this case and what wouldn't be looked upon as bad form.<br/><br/>For instance, If I let the player play a character and allowed them to name the character despite all else being pre-ordained, is naming the character "character generation"?<br/><br/>Also, If anyone else wants to discuss the ramifications of their constraints should they have any issues this space is for rent.<br/><br/>JOE--                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238525/#Comment_238525" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T06:35:29+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  6:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does character mean?

To me, the term has always had a mechanical meaning rather than an aesthetic one. Sure, most character generation systems will suggest you think about who your character is and how they act, but to me that's more part of role-playing than generation since these factors often do not interact directly with the rules. You could role-play any character without interacting with the game's rules once. So I'd have interpreted that as meaning 'no character statistics should be necessary'. There are ways around that; for example, in my game I'm planning on not giving the characters statistics anyway. Instead, the company they work for has all the mechanical statistics and they 'borrow' what they need from it. Their own abilities don't enter into the equation. Another way around it of course would be to provide only pre-generated characters. They've been made for you, therefore they haven't been generated. There are bound to be tons of other answers to the question though, and I doubt anyone will raise any complaints if you lay down a clear, logical and honest line of reasoning as to why your game has no character generation.<br/><br/>With 'Must be played around strangers', I'd interpret that as the actual gameplay being in the vicinity of strangers. You could probably get away with generating characters elsewhere with no strangers around, but I personally don't count character generation as being part of actual play. Your definition may be different, so like I said before I doubt anyone would worry so long as you were clear in what the constraint actually means to you without twisting the given meaning too much. What's more I'd say it'd be best if the mechanics or atmosphere of the game actually depended upon the fact that there are strangers around. That, however, is going to be difficult to manage without risking breaking social taboos. Ever hear of a game called 'Killer'? Players are assassins who each must 'kill' another player using a suitable physical representation. Water pistols or cap guns stand for real guns, shoeboxes wrapped in duct tape are bombs, though a sound effect is required for it to go off, and specific very strong and unpleasant flavours usually go for poison. Thing is, all of this is done while real life happens around you. There's no stepping in and out of character, if someone gets you, they get you. This can sometimes upset ordinary people who just happen to be passing when somebody jumps out of the shrubbery and shoots their friend with a toy pistol. It's a game that has to be played very, very, very carefully.<br/><br/>My own constraint is rather giving me gyp too. I've got 'Played by Text Message'. Realistically, if we take telephone text messages as being the meaning here, that means I have to limit the amount of interaction between the players dramatically since these cost money, and it's awkward forwarding them to a long list of people. I have a kind of solution that I'm working through, but it's presenting some annoying difficulties, most notably making sure that everyone is up-to-date on the current state of play because of the problems presented by having to text several people at once.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238851/#Comment_238851" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T07:13:04+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  7:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what its worth, I think <i>exploring</i> a constraint and then abandoning it because it's getting in the way of making a good game is totally valid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/artexercise" title="artexercise"><img alt="artexercise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://artexercise.mygamesonline.org/graphics/Dragon_Icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/artexercise">artexercise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238858/#Comment_238858" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T07:45:17+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  7:45AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got two different ideas, in both cases a name is all I need.
