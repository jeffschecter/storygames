A lot of us have moved to primarily digital distribution, but there's something about the "book, in print, as originally envisioned" (vs say Print on Demand, which is an excellent side solution), especially in component-rich games.<br/><br/>I've used a reshipping service for years now to get goods that don't appear on Amazon.co.jp shipped to me from Japan to the US: Books, games, house goods, etc. Recently, I have a few friends who live outside of the US who have saved considerable money on shipping by using a reshipper service that works specifically for their country. Frex, for the New Zealand one below, I measured a package that would take the USPS (the cheapest and best shipping option) $55 to deliver within 10 days. Utilizing his specific US--&gt;NZ reshipper (which apparently has offices/warehouse in Portland) he got the game in the same time (10 days) at a total cost of $35. That's an absolute success in my book, and I want to help others find these kinds of reshippers to help with future game, Kickstarter etc purchases.<br/><br/>For various reasons, I want to compile a list of these for various countries. I'm aiming for reshippers/forwarders that work with your (non-US) country to get goods from the USA to your country.<br/><br/>The rules are simple: You have to have experience using it, or have a friend that uses it; enough to say, "I can verify that this service works, and am satisfied with it" (not just "I've heard of these guys, but no I know of has used them yet").<br/><br/>=========================================<br/><br/>Here is the current list of US ---&gt; Other Country reshippers, verified directly by community members or friends (I'll update this post daily or so).<br/><br/><b>US to New Zealand:</b> <a href="http://www.nzpost.co.nz/tools/youshop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nzpost.co.nz/tools/youshop</a><br/><br/>=========================================<br/><br/>Who do you use, whom you would recommend, to ship goods/books from USA to your country?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
