                    So, one of my players went all ape-shit over the World's Largest Dungeon book which is 900 pages, 16 poster maps,  and 1600 encounters of dungeon crawling goodness.  He went out and bought the thing ($100) and plopped it in my lap.  "We wanna play this!", my group chanted in unison and then offered the appropriate sacrifices of pizza and beer.  I was a little apprehensive about running such a huge dungeon but I kinda like dungeon crawls too.  Also, I started reading the text and was pleasantly surprised at how well the designers put the product together.  They really thought about making the product easy to use without having to flip back and forth between 3 or 4 different sourcebooks.  Maybe I'll review the product later but for the sake of this discussion, let's just say I liked the product enough on reading it to give running it a go.<br/><br/>Now, one of the things the designers say in the text is that the normal XP system outlined in the DMG breaks down if this dungeon is run as 1 huge campaign.  There are simply too many encounters and the characters will find themselves leveling way faster than usual.  So, they said to either just hand out XP at various plot points in the dungeon or to find an alternative XP system to use.  Great!  I thought.  I can try out the Wyrd XP system that I read about over on the Forge.  It works by allowing the players to chose goals for their characters, giving the players bonuses when pursuing those goals, and then rewarding them richly upon completing the goals.  That rocks and I figured would shoe horn quite well into the game.<br/><br/>So I brought the new XP system up to the players and two of them basically said, "I don't like my character to have goals!"<br/><br/>WTF?  I was blown away.  It has never, ever in all my years of gaming crossed my mind to play a character without having goals.  What the hell do you do with the character if you don't have any goals for it?  I mean, if I can't think of some cool goal for a character then I just trash the thing and create a new one.  This isn't even a product of playing these new fangled hippie games.  This is from way back with AD&amp;D 1ed, Vampire, Rifts, RuneQuest... whatever.  All my characters had goals.  Even if they were simple things like "Prove I'm a better adventurer than So-And-So."<br/><br/>I didn't know how to respond to such a statement so I just said, "Okay, how 'bout I just reward XP at appropriate times?"  Everyone was good with this... well, except me.  I'm a little worried now.  How long can you sustain a game or player interest if the players don't even have a goal to pursue with their characters.  Just getting through a dungeon is a good enough goal for a 1 session dungeon but it seems rather insufficient for a sustained game.  Has anyone else ever run across this sentiment before in players?  Does anyone here actually hold this sentiment themselves?  Can you explain the logic of it to me?  It is beyond my comprehension at the moment.                </div>

                            I think I can understand where they're coming from. It's a dungeon crawl. It's mindless knockabout fun. If I was playing that, I wouldn't want any goals more complex than "Hit a few monsters about the head".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            For those players in your group, I'd guess their "characters" goals might include: freedom, wealth, magic items, etc.  If *not* then they don't care about getting out of the dungeon, and won't be picking up any treasure they find along the way. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
My semi-ranty aside: Some players like to have absolutely no constraints on their character's behaviour.  Whatever they choose to do at any given moment should be acceptible.  For me, this spoils the game a bit as the characters seem less like semi-believable "people" and more like people possessed by demons (eg. as in the movie <i>Fallen</i>).  Amoral, fearless, shameless, and virtually unconcerned with any long term goals beyond "the adventure". Blah!                        </div>

                            Graham,<br><br>I can sorta see your point and concede that in a dungeon crawl that might be the case (It isn't for me but that's beside the point).  However, his statement wasn't just about this particular game.  It was a statement that he didn't like his characters to have goals... um... like ever.  In looking back I can see this is true with regards to him.  He didn't particularly like the Keys in TSoY or the idea of the BITs in Burning Wheel and now he doesn't like the Wyrd system of experience.  He really doesn't like systems where he has to think about goals/desires/motivations for his characters.  Actually "He" is two separate players both of whom expressed this sentiment.  This general dislike of actively considered goals/desires/motivations is what bumfuzzles me.  I just can't wrap my head around the concept of playing a character who is essentially a piece of driftwood or tumbleweed.<br/><br/>Stuart,<br/><br/>I'm definitely with you on the unrestrained character behaviour.  It's a little irritating for me too.                        </br></br></div>

                            When I was but a mere boy and a beardless youth, I had plenty of characters without goals. The character was my vehicle to mess around in the world and see what happens, maybe gather some plot tokens to see what happens on the other side of that complication, maybe gather some coins to see what cool crap I can buy with it, but the character had no more goal, or personality for that matter, than a collection of witty remarks and hilarious (really) puns and fourth-wall-breaking references to what they were going on around them.<br/>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>I can see that.  Never thought about it but it makes sense.  I guess since I didn't get into this hobby until I was past the boy stage and more into the beardless youth stage, I might have skipped that particular developmental process.                        </div>

<p>Gee, then maybe you are playing with the wrong people. I feel like you're like shocked and bewildered by these gentlemens' playstyle, and you're describing them like they are crazy people, but almost certainly they're not. They're just some guys that don't play like you. So don't play with them. There is no need to blacken their name.</p>

Man, that's weak (IMO). What's the point of crawling through the WLD if you don't get XP for killing things and taking their stuff?<br/><br/>My recommendation would be to simply use the D&amp;D XP system as-is, but divide the awards by some reasonable amount. That's the basic way to control the speed of leveling up. Maybe start with 50% and see how it goes. Plus, it's in keeping with your player's expectations.                        </div>

                            Alternately, Andrew, "I don't want my character to have goals" may be their way of saying, "I as a player do not want to set goals for my own character but would be perfectly happy accepting any goals that the GM decided to give me through subtle and not-so-subtle plot developments."  Basically, an appeal for Participationist game play where the default assumption is that the game tells the GM's story and the players are merely participants within that structure.<br/><br/>I haven't seen WLD (and am not a D&amp;D player), but are there big moral decisions to be made and crises to resolve, or is it level upon level of killable monsters with enviable stuff?

<br/>
I've found listening to Hal and his group go through WLD and now Ptolus / The Banewarrens to be *extremely* helpful in designing my own game.  It's one thing to have people tell you in a written report what worked and what didn't in a game.  It's something else entirely to be able to listen an make notes on when things run well, when they don't, when the rules work, when there's confusion, when roleplaying is good, and when it's... not so good. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>With a group as enthusiastic about playing World's Largest Dungeon I'm not surprised, nor would I really fault them.  I haven't read World's Largest Dungeon. Does it provide motivation for going into the dungeon in the first place?  I make a big distinction between character goals and scenario objectives.  Sometimes having character goals just gets in the way of exploring and pursuing the scenario objectives.<br/><br/>You mention that there are all sorts of political and moral crises built into the dungeon.  But I'm curious as to what the game expects the players to do be up to by the time they encounter these crises.  Are they walking in cold (like a Dogs town) or by that time are they in pursuit of something the scenario has set up at an early point?  In that capacity moral and political crises can be great TACTICAL LIMITERS on scenario objectives rather than opportunities for character statements.<br/><br/>So my answer to your initial question is another question: Does the Dungeon provide the goals for the players?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            Jesse,<br/><br/>The only goal that comes "packaged" with the WLD is to escape.  The front door is like a roach motel.  You can enter but it is impossible to leave.  Thus, you have to go through the dungeon to get out.  Each individual section of dungeon might have goals attached to it, like helping the Celestials against the shadows and barghests in Section E, but the characters are generally going to come up on those situations cold... like in DitV... without even the implicit goal present in DitV.                        </div>

Well, that's great: isn't that the goal, then? It's a rather compelling one.<br/><br/>The thing is: if I was a player, I'd grudgingly let you give me a goal. I'd let you give me "I want to be braver than XXX" or "I want to prove myself to my mother's memory". But, really, I'd just be thinking about making my way through the dungeon.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            It occurred to me you could always pull the old 'one of your family members has been kidnapped and is here' trick, but for WLD it would be ridiculous: in every section you'd put somebody's second cousin, and they only get to level when they find them and zap them with the escape wand that only works on NPCs.

My question is: is this needed in WLD? <br/><br/>I mean, is there already a goal in helping the Celestials? Will it increase your chances of survival and escape? Will it gain you extra XP? Magic items? Access to resurection magic? <br/><br/>Because all of those things, in D&amp;D context, already give you goals for doing it. If it doesn't give you any of those things, however, then we've got some issues.                        </div>

                            Again, having not actually seen the book, it very well may be a manual for the GM on giving the PCs goals to acheive.  There may not be any need for the GM to stack additional stuff -- captured family members -- on top of the already existing XP/items/magic/whatever that's printed in the book.                        </div>

                            Good stuff in this thread. I want to add how the GM was treated in the games I described above. Imagine the GM as a stage magician. The GM gets his particular kicks from showing us spectacular things.  We know the spectacular things are fake but as observers, we gain great enjoyment from imagining that they are real and if the performance is good, we may even "lose ourselves" in the "magical" effects and the logic they have.<br/>
<br/>
There's no magic and nobody in the room, including the magician (ESPECIALLY the magician) thinks there is. We're just happy to watch it as if there was.                        </div>

                            I've been running WLD for the last 18 months or so, and the party is not even halfway through.<br/>
As for the original point about character goals - there are section goals within each part of the dungeon.<br/>
Parties can treat it like a dungeon bash, or interact more with the inhabitants of the dungeon, discover the backplot and get more in to the roleplaying part of it.<br/>
The bit about the experience points is valid because there are more encounters in each section than need to be had.<br/>
If you have a party that insists on visiting every room (normally over 100 per section - and there are 15 sections) and fight every creature / set off every trap etc. then yes - they would "earned" more experience points than they need to progress a couple of levels per section. BUT - most parties would get bored way beyond then and want to move on - particularly if you make it uncomfortable for them to stay in the one place too long.<br/>
There is a HUGE (over 1900 posts) thread on the ENWorld forums (http://enworld.org/showthread.php?t=100030) for DMs who are running this beast - and includes ideas about making it more interesting for players - including those who don't develop and push their own goals.                        </div>

Basically it boils down to this: Sometimes players play Reactively and just spend the whole time reacting to what the GM throws at them.  So if they set any character goals beyond Survival and Reward they are generally Reactive ones: <i>Protect</i> this, <i>Avoid</i> that, <i>Defend</i> the other etc.  In extreme cases, they expect the GM to instigate any and all conflicts and will turtle if there is no obvious "correct" path of action.                        </div>

<p>Andrew, you want something different out of roleplaying than the other people. You can compromise (with the resultant diminishing of the impact of your various tastes), you can capitulate, or you can force the players to do what you want.</p>
<p>Or you can do something else.</p>
<p>When confronted with a similar issue, I moved to another state where I had players of like mind to play with.</p>
<p>I think Rich might be right, assuming Josh is right. But what's really clear to me is that Jason's right: you're using a hack for a particular tool that gets what <em>you</em> want better out of a system that, without the hack, gets them what <em>they</em> want.</p>
<p>Compromise, capitulate, force, or bail. I suggest that if your social agenda is to hang with these guys, you do one of the first two. If it's to get the kind of game you want, take the last. Don't force them; they'll most likely dig in their heels.</p>

Yes. The issue is probably more that the encounters will cease to be of any challenge. I was running City of the Spider Queen for a larger-than-standard group; consequently, they were having a fairly easy time running through encounters. I assumed that more encounters = more fun, but they specifically asked me to ramp up the difficulty, as it just plain wasn't fun for them to win so easily.                        </div>

Nice analogy, Ben, but on the other hand, I find there's a huge difference between a serious game - in which table-talk is strictly utilitarian and/or a weapon - and a friendly game, in which trash-talk, swagger, and goofy dealer's-choice games are part of the fun.<br/><br/>To bring that back around to the OP situation, the outright rejection of character goals is, to my mind, a much more extreme and therefore potentially "shocking" preference than the more typical "character goals as that thing that goes on between combat setpieces" style of hybrid D&amp;D play. I don't read Gaerik as trying to impose a hard-core goal-driven mode of play as much as "hey, we need to find a different way of doing advancement - how about tying into character goals?" and being surprised at the vehemence of the objections.                        </div>

Point being, though, that there was no <em>need</em> -- just a personal preference on the part of Andrew, and one that wasn't shared by the other players.  That the others were profoundly disinterested in his preference of play really isn't that surprising -- try playing Uno with strangers and see how many cards everybody draws when they can't play (or how auctions work in Monopoly).  You'll see the same sort of vehement disagreement over how the game is "supposed" to be played.                        </div>

Point being, though, that there was no<em>need</em>-- just a personal preference on the part of Andrew, and one that wasn't shared by the other players.<br/><br/>Are you sure? I think that's debateable. The text of WLD suggests that conventional advancement methods will not work correctly, but makes only rudimentary suggestions of an alternative. 
<blockquote><cite>Original post</cite>Now, one of the things the designers say in the text is that the normal XP system outlined in the DMG breaks down if this dungeon is run as 1 huge campaign. There are simply too many encounters and the characters will find themselves leveling way faster than usual. So, they said to either just hand out XP <b>at various plot points</b> in the dungeon or to find an alternative XP system to use.</blockquote> (emphasis mine)<br/>Andrew, exercising one of the traditional responsibilities/authorities of the GM, and in accordance with the WLD text, suggests an alternative of his own devising. Instead of canned "plot points" suggested by the adventure, he is thinking that players might have a hand in deciding what a "plot point" is through setting their own goals.<br/><br/>Now, this might very well illustrate why that traditional assumption of "GM proposes" can result in boom... at least he proposed it, instead of simply declaring - as many GMs would do, in my experience, and then get mad when the players passive-aggressively undermined it, instead of just coming right out in opposition.                        </div>

<p>Gaerik, correct me if I'm wrong, but: you guys have been playing together for a while and have all enjoyed it, right? And, until these two players stated emphatically that they don't like pre-set character goals, you didn't even notice it, right?</p>
<p>If so, I don't even see this as something that needs compromise. You like character goals, but obviously, they can play well without them. If you were creating an adventure for them, then you could claim that you prefer players to do part of the prep work for you by setting character goals. But you're playing a commercial product. You don't need to motivate the <em>players</em> (they told you they want to play this) and you don't need to motivate the <em>characters</em> (there's a built-in goal of "escape from the dungeon".) Everything's taken care of.</p>
<p>All the discussion about players who turn turtle is irrelevant, unless you know from experience these players frequently turn turtle. Just because there is no <em>storyline</em> goal (like "avenge my father" or "become a noble") doesn't mean the characters don't have <em>any</em> goals; presumably, they all have the goal of "go on adventures" and pick up more focused, transitory goals during play.</p>

                            Okay.  I was away for a little while and there is too much stuff to respond to all of it point by point, so I'll just try to cover as much as I can.<br/><br/>No, I wasn't trying to shove my way of gaining XP down my player's throats.  I actually offered two possibilities for systems we could use and the fact that they chose the one that wasn't my own preference didn't bother me at all.  The thing that surprised me was the statement, "I don't like having characters with goals."  That blew my mind because I can't really conceive of having a character with no goals whatsoever.  Now, Joshua (I think) has since posited that what the player might have meant was, "I don't like coming up with my character's goals.  I want you to do it in the game."  Given my knowledge of the players in question, this seems a likely interpretation.  It most certainly isn't the way I normally approach things as a player.<br/><br/>I have played with these players before for a long while with mixed results.  I know and like all of them outside of gaming.  In the game they tend to be far less proactive than I'd like for them to be.  They're a hell of a lot less proactive than I am as a player.  This has been a source of some frustration for me in the past.  The player's recent statement about character goals sheds some real light on the issue.  They sit around waiting for me to define their goals and throw something at them while I'm sitting there waiting for them to give me a hint about what they want thrown at them.  Since we are playing a published module this time I doubt I'll have as much problem with that as usual.  After all, the module tells me what to throw at them.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wasn't trying to blast the players as crap or anything.  I was just throwing the situation up there to see what folks around here might think.  As usual there was a lot of good insight and I'm better off than I was when I started the thread.                        </div>

                            I think you missed something when you were asking for character goals.  You didn't just ask them if their characters had any goals, you asked them if they would like to declare goals and use those declared goals to determine how much XP they get.  Declaring goals is fine (or not), but as soon as you start tying things like character advancement into the achievement of those goals, then picking those goals becomes a strategic decision (at least if you have a Gamist agenda).  Not only is it a strategic decision, it could very well be the most important decision you make for the character, since it will effectively determine your rate of advancement, and therefore the effectiveness of your character.  Furthermore, you have no basis for making that decision, since before the game you don't know what kind of goals will be easiest to gain XP with.  From a gamist perspective, this doesn't sound fun.<br/>

                            I personally suck as a player.  Why?  Becuase my characters don't have goals.  I'd like for them to have goals, but lacking any real-life goals, it's difficult for me to create imaginary ones.<br/>
<br/>
Having goals can be unpleasant, because it means that you have to pretend to care about something that you don't really care about, and it also sets up a situation where your character wants something that he can't have.  That's just making trouble for yourself.  Play may not be as deep, but it's less stressful.  That's just me, of course.                        </div>

Oh, but it's so cool when your character wants something they can't have, and then they have to deal with that...  I mean, you're assuming that your character having a goal means that you as a player actually want them to achieve it.<br/><br/>Heh, ok, clearly very different styles of play going on here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>You really don't have any real life goals?  Really?  You don't have a goal to make enough money to buy groceries this week?  What about your job/school?  You don't want to get a raise or graduate or whatnot?  You don't have a desire to go on vacation to GenCon, Disney World, or wherever floats your boat?  Nothing?  I find that hard to believe.<br/><br/>I think people sometimes mistake a desire on my part to see some goals in play as the need to see some grandiose goals.  I don't care if the player's goal for his character is "Adventure to make enough money to pay the bills."  I mean... wow...  That goal, small as it is, gives me a metric shit-ton of grist for the ol' GMing mill.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not saying that in this case (The World's Largest Dungeon) needs a whole lot of goals beyond "Get out alive."  I mean, it is a dungeon crawl.  I'm not looking to turn it into great literary fiction.                        </div>

                            A LOT of misery in roleplaying has come from people trying to make D&amp;D do things it wasn't designed to do. It evolved from wargames, it's about winning this fight so you can be better at winning the next fight, and all the 3rd edition stuff about feats and prestige classes reinforces this focus. From what I hear -- e.g. from Ben Lehman -- is now a smoothly designed, streamlined, downright AWESOME game for fighting for the opportunity to fight more effectively. For moral dilemmas, social commentary, or character growth other than "I become a hero," it's probably the wrong tool. Not a bad game, mind you, just the wrong game for the purpose.<br/><br/>If your friends drove up in their brand-new Ferraris and Lamborginis and Porsches and said, "Dude, there's this amazing road out in the Midwest. Five hundred straight miles of nothin' ! Think how cool that would be!" and you say, "Yeah, but that could be a little dull, how about we stop every fifty miles and go off-roading for a while" -- well, they would look at you as if you were crazy. Your choice is to convince them to hop in some 4x4s to wander around in the mud and woods instead, or to convince yourself to get in a hotrod and enjoy the long, straight, fast ride. Trying to compromise by taking the sportscars off-road or the 4x4s racing is just going to get you a lot of breakdowns and no fun for anybody.                        </div>

                            Yes, I'm fully aware that wanting things that you can't have (or at least have to fight for) is lovely drama fodder.  I'm totally all over that.  All of this story-game business is what I've been looking for, lo my many years of gaming.  I'm just no good at it.  So I was thinking that might be what the OP's players issues are.  Maybe they just can't bring themselves to "penalize" their characters.  Heck, I know that I don't even take "drawbacks" for bonus points in games that support them.  So while the player might want his character to suffer for drama's sake, he knows that he will have to deal with the fallout of it, which seems like alot of work.  Maybe the players should assign goals to the other players characters.  Then maybe they keep them, or maybe the GM tells them to take them back and apply them to thier own characters instead.  Makes it a little less personal and also makes it less likely that the players will hedge on the goals.  Maybe.

I suppose I could be deluding myself, but no.  I don't consider it.  I occasionally "wish" for those things I suppose, but I don't seriously consider them.  I think I'd like to go to GenCon for instance, but I say that every year and then I don't go, and it's no big deal.  I just work.  If I make enough money for groceries, fine.  If I don't, THEN I'll deal with it.  I game the same way.  I follow the rest of the party around, say something funny once in a while, and react to whatever obstacles fall in front of me or follow whatever orders the other PCs give me.  I don't know if this is the same for the OP's players, but I imagine it's an issue for SOMEBODY.                        </div>

                            This interests me, a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I love these newfangled story-games. They are a lot more fun for me than what I was used to in the earlier days of the hobby. My wife, however, shares the view that your players do: She prefers to react to things as they come up, rather than plan ahead. It's difficult for her to focus on a character before any of the in-game drama happens, she prefers to let the in-game drama temper and sharpen her character, basically "discovering" the character through play. She found the upcoming Sorcerer &amp; Sword game we have planned difficult, because we haven't started playing, but she's already had to invest a lot of skull-sweat thinking about the character, and she hasn't been able to interact with the world enough to get a feel for how her character "should" operate. Character creation for her is stressful because of her playstyle preferences. She is, in all other respects, a good player.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is designed to be a glorified dungeon-crawl, I'd say compromise: Tell the players that, when they come across a goal they can get behind, declare it in-game. In addition to any XP they normally get, if their actions contributed to achieving their character's goals, they get an additional 10% on top of that. If they have multiple goals, and those goals are met, the 10% stacks. (Ex. three goals met=+30% xp bonus.) Be sure to let them know that "I want to improve my prowess at [character class]", "I want as much wealth and cool toys as I can carry out of here", and "I long for the thrill of combat" are valid goals; some people simply do not want more out of life than that. Just explain to them that those who have a drive beyond simple survival (which is a given) tend to advance quicker, as those are the types of people who are motivated to learn faster. If it's used as a carrot, rather than a stick, it should go down easier.<br/>
<br/>
Yes they may level up faster, but since this game has a built-in encouragement for them to seek out bigger and badder things, this should not be too problematic.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.                        </div>

                            Hi Andrew,<br>
<br>
I've been roleplayingfor decades and have spent much of that time longing for narrativist play (the style that wyrds, keys, muses, spiritual attributes, or goals all tend to support). When I first learned it was possible to play a game where narrativism was the focus, I was tempted to declare it the ONE TRUE WAY. What I've learned since then, is that there are people who've longed to have other agendas expressed just as clearly in play -- and have been just as frustrated as I -- and they too have a tendency to extreme responses when pushing for a chance to play their prefered style.<br>
<br>
I suspect the vehemence of your players' response results from an internal process something like this:<br>
<br>
Cool, the World's Largest Dungeon! Tricks, traps, challenges, tactical maneuvers, fights! There no way this can produce anything but the sort of player challenges I really had fun with that time back years ago. What? You want player goals? WTF? Why are you messing with a perfectly clear game agenda? No!<br>
<br>
I don't claim to read minds. My point is that WLD is the kind of setting where players in the past have experienced gamist play -- and which also strongly supports gamist play. Now here you go, looking to mess with the all important reward mechanism...grafting on something that rewards something other than player cleverness. <br/>
<br/>
My second point is that many players have been frustrated by not getting a clear reward from past play and they may work hard to get it when they see the opprotunity (and they should; you should too; not in game, but in the social negotation before play).<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to negotiate. First, take a look at your own needs. Are you trying to insert player goals because that's the only play you are willing to offer? Or because you're in the same kind of frustrated position I described above? <br/>
<br/>
If a hypotehtical someone else ran WLD would you play for what it is, rather than what you want? Once you know what you want, talk to your people. Some options on the table are: someone else GMs WLD. You run WLD for four or five sessions, then switch to (say) Shadow of Yesterday for a four sessions. (Limits are important -- if someone's been frustrated in a desire, they can jump to conclusions.) Finally, you can sit out WLD, or even meet separately (at another time) with people who're interested in another game.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the club of people who would like to experience a good, clear narrativist agenda and who've rarely experienced it. I know what it's like to be frustrated and want something else. But I've also learned that I can be perfectly happing playing or GMing to support a gamist agenda, provided I'm clear that's what I'm doing. <br/>
<br/>
If you do run WLD, do the dungeon crawl whole hog. That's what it's best suited for. Enstate an XP system that rewards players for achievement and maybe even competition -- defeating an opponent, overcoming a trap, entering the 5th level, getting in the final blow, killing the most in a single battle. If the existing XP system means they level up too fast, then half the rewards. <br/>
<br/>
You might want to have a look at Tunnels and Trolls or Agon for ideas about GM attitude and approach.<br/>

                            I've had problems with goals before (and, you know, I think player/character-goals are great in general)--but I'd stay away from being too hung-up on them.<br/><br/>1. Pressuring players to take goals can create cases (I've seen) where the player adopts a goal but isn't excited about it. This is, IME, worse than "no goal."<br/>2. Before play starts <i>I</i> sometimes have problems coming up with goals. I may not be that familiar with the character or the world ... if other stuff besides character-generated drama is going on in the world (and this applies to games even like Sorcerer and DitV) then I'd rather my goals work more closely with that than simply be a goal that may be tangential.<br/>3. I may find that helping another player with their goal is more interesting than pursuing mine.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, doing goal-based experience would be a problem for me--especially in a dungeon crawl scenario where my main point in being there is to "explore/clean-out" the dungeon. And I'm, you know, pretty hip to the whole goal-oriented, PC-driven play thing. <br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            I'm sort of improvising a leveling up system for this game.  Each section of the dungeon (and it is huge) has certain key plot points.  I'm going to level them up every time they hit on and complete it successfully.  There are 15 sections to the dungeon  with 3 to 5 plot points per sections.  Players won't do all the sections (at least it is difficult and requires a lot of backtracking to do) and some points are mutually exclusive.  If I've calculated correctly they should be 18th - 22nd level by the time they finish the dungeon.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone for all their comments.  It's been a fruitful discussion but I think I've gotten just about everything I can out of this topic for the moment.                        </div>

                            If you have a party of more than 4 players, and they don't try and clear out an entire area before moving on, then the normal XP system is fine. RPGMP3 did a (actually 40) podcast on the entire dungeon (well - at least those bits the party adventured through) - basing XP advancement on the EL of each encounter - and it tracked pretty well.<br/>
Many DMs have opted for a more streamlined "level the party up a couple of times each section". This can be done by having key rooms provide the levelling, or levelling based on major plot goals being achieved - really depends on what style of play your players go for.<br/>
Some of my players I assume have no clearer goals than to get involved in a fight every so often - but I run more of a beer &amp; pretzels type game.<br/>
Alan was pretty well spot on - it's a dungeon crawl - with enough variety between sections to stop it getting too boring. And Jim Pinto (who put the whole thing together) recommends spicing things with non-SRD material if you have it - especially if the players are non-SRD.<br/>
The goal should be to have fun, enjoy the game, and get your money's worth out of the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
So - despite players not having character goals - have fun, enjoy the game, and WLD is definitely a good way of getting money's worth out of the hobby.                        </div>
