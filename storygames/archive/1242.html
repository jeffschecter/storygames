                    From ye olde blogge poestte: <a href="http://blog.kumapageworks.org/blog/?p=139" rel="nofollow">http://blog.kumapageworks.org/blog/?p=139</a>
<p>So we've looked at what I'd call <em>immersive play</em> and what it means in terms of the AGE Model - the convergence of the various spaces of the game, such that movement or information from the various spaces is not disruptive to the experience of the game.  The player enters a state of <em>flow</em> - or a sensation of <em>being</em> the game instead of simply <em>playing </em>the game.</p>
<p>While immersion is easily accomplished with computer games - any game is a candidate for immersion: play a few particularly balls-to-the-wall games of chess with your Ukranian boss and you'll see what I mean.  (I never had a chance of winning, but I did have him worried from time to time.)  I'd argue that RPGs, while quite capable of an immersive experience are more difficult for immersion to form, simply because of the sheer volume of different agendas and intents that are around the gaming table.  It's easy to get lost in a computer game when it's you alone in your head with a copy of <em>Call of Duty</em>.  It's much harder to mantain that flow when you have multiple people involved, some of whom might not be interested in attaining this kind of state.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'd like to address something that John Kim said on his blog (and in various forum threads) over the last few days, and to introduce the idea of <em>isolationist</em> play.</p>
<p>In contrast with immersion play, isolation play is an attempt by the player to engage one (and only one) space exclusively, with a minimum of interference from the other spaces.  John talks about the concept of 'mask play', and references it in his article on the Threefold-Model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Mask-play' is the most complete way that the player can enter the game-world.  Think of it as a virtual reality: when the player looks around, they see the game-world.  They look at other players and see the characters.  They look in a mirror and see their character's face. Only by doing this, by shutting out as much of the real world as possible, will the player be able to let their normal personality take a back seat, and allow the personality of their fictional character to take over.  I can't describe what that actually means because it doesn't happen often enough to be analyzed, but personal experience makes me think it's worth striving for.</p>
<small>Wallis, J. 1995. Through a mask, darkly: Connecting players and roles. <em>Interactive Fantasy</em>, 3, p. unknown.</small><br/></blockquote>
<p>In this passage, we see that Wallis is talking about engaging the emspace completely and <em>solely</em>, "by shutting out as much of the real world as possible".  That means no playspace, no gamespace.  (Of course, you always have your own personal aspace with you, so shutting that out is impossible.)  So this is where I'm drawing <em>isolationist</em> play from - the idea that the player isolates themselves in a preferred space and sees all of the action of the game from that point of view.</p>
<p>John's own comments support this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My experience has been that highly immersive play is seen as problematic in most traditional RPGs. Immersively played characters will frequently break the rules: by splitting the party, by questioning other PCs, and by failing to follow the meta-game cues for the direction of the adventure. In the past, I've had multiple fights with the GM because my character went off to do something which broke the assumptions of the adventure. The stereotypical case is when an NPC approaches the PCs with a job offer. A player who suggests refusing the offer is quickly labelled a troublemaker."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, John is talking about looking at a situation purely from the character's PoV in the emspace - no information from other spaces is considered.  John calls these 'meta-game cues', but really what we're looking at are the other spaces involved in the play of an RPG.  The first and foremost of these is the playspace - as a player, John knows that the GM is likely introducing an adventure hook.  (For the record, I'd like to say that I think that John's apparently had a boatload of crappy GMs.  I mean, who has NPC walk up and offer jobs anymore?  Soooo 1987.)  This information from the playspace is ignored, however, and a decision is made purely on the <em>prima facia</em> of the emspace circumstances - the character refuses the job because he wants to, or because the guy looks shady, or because his credstick is bad.</p> </div>

<p>The problem (one of the possible problems) with isolationist play is that the states of the other spaces must coincide so that they are frictionless with the remaining space.  You have to agree ahead of time that you're operating solely on emspace information.  Given that understanding in the playspace, the GM would be better off with an open, <em>GTA </em>approach to gameplay, driven by the actions of the characters instead of driving a narrative foreign to the emspace.  When the intervention of the rules is necessary, there should be understandings on how that information is dealt with and re-incorporated into the emspace where the players can then act on it.</p>
<p>There's likely going to be a negative association with folks on me choosing 'isolationist' as a name for the play method - but I think that the term is apt and differentiates it from the definition that I've worked up on immersion.  Emspace isolation isn't the only mode - it just happens to be a common one.  A group of casual gamers might engage in a sort of weak gamespace isolation, not engaging in in-character play at all.</p>
<p>It's easy to see where the difference between the two states would be lost - both immersion and isolation deal with single space.  But the root cause and the nature of that space are different in the two approaches.</p> </div>

                            Interesting ideas, but if "immersive play" is a problematic term because of multiple meanings, 'isolationist play' is probably worse.  It suggests solitary play, as well as withdrawing from others -- which is a negative activity in a social game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            This is an interesting idea, although I am a little worried about framing it in terms of isolation v. immersion.  What you describe as isolationist seems a particularly narrow form of immersion.  Now, I get that you are using immersion in a more techinical sense than that, but, well, the results seem to be sort of the same.<br/><br/>Immersion is low-friction with multiple spaces, isolation is low-friction with one space.  If we think of immersion as the set of spaces facilitating low-friction play, then isolation is just immersion with a set of 1.  It still seems to come down to the same question: how do you orchestrate the spaces *not* involved in the set from screwing up the fun--from 'showing' too much and breaking immersion.  Does that make sense or am I misunderstanding something?                        </div>

                            Stuart, if the assumption is made to be sorta "anti-social" during play to achieve a certain goal, I'm sure that the social aspect will be the congratulations on the success of the play afterwards. That is, I think that he points out that it's only really problematic if not everyone has this agenda. <br/><br/>Think of it like True Dungeon. You never even get to meet the "actors" playing the monsters and such. Their only reinforcement is from the people who run the event who assure them that the people playing are having a good time, or simply by seeing the affects of their acting. To take the analogy farther, it's like being in a play - you don't expect applause until the curtain falls. <br/><br/>Where I think it's problematic to an extent is that you dump the social feedback methods that exist in other forms of play that allow you to tweak the content as you go along. This tradeoff is, largely, the matter of preference that determines one's predilection for one of these agendas or another. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            I guess what I mean is that if there is a group of people really into being immersed in their characters, they can be interacting with each other a lot (rather than just hearing about what's going on via the DM) -- so it being immersive play doesn't mean it's isolationistic... the Scandinavian LARPs which have immersion as the focus seem to be very social.                        </div>

Hmm.  I dislike the term "isolationist" because it implies that play is "anti-social", which I don't see any basis for.  You're just interacting with other players in-character rather than meta-game.  It seems very peculiar to me that you could see someone chatting, hugging, and otherwise interacting with other players for hours and say that its not social -- and that the only "social aspect" is the congratulations afterwards.  <br/><br/>It seems to me to be a term based upon treating in-character interaction as an Other.  <br/><br/>For example, we might picture someone who calls himself a "social gamer" who comes to the table mainly to chat with the other players about various real life topics.  This works OK in some low-concentration games with all non-verbal moves, like some card or board games.  However, in a tabletop RPG, it's likely that other players would complain about his out-of-game chatter, and to stick to the "play-space" or "game-space" during the game.  I can see that he might call the other players "anti-social" and "isolationist" , but I don't think he's right.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Isbo</cite>Immersion is low-friction with multiple spaces, isolation is low-friction with one space.</blockquote>
The difference is that while immersion is low-friction between all of the spaces, isolation is low-friction <i>within one space</i>, but <i>high</i> friction between that space and the other spaces.  Working within the emspace is easy - involving the other spaces is verboten, or at least frowned upon.
<blockquote>If we think of immersion as the set of spaces facilitating low-friction play, then isolation is just immersion with a set of 1.

Does that make sense or am I misunderstanding something?</blockquote>
Immersion (as I'm looking at it) means that the gamespace, emspace and playspace are all mixing easily, so that the disruption required to break immersion has to be large - the player is manipulating information from the playspace (the GM's input, the input of the other players), the gamespace (any rolling or other mechanical bits are done 'by rote' or with a minimum of friction) and the in-character information.  A major disruption like needing to look up the stats for a medusa, not accepting 'fudging', and the book being in the other room, would break immersion, but possibly only temporarily.  Of course in an immersion state that sort of disruption might be less likely to occur as well, because the players might want to preserve the state.<br/><br/>Isolationist (and yes, I'd love to have a better word - about the only other one I've found so far is 'perspectivist') play requires that all negotiation be completed inside the chosen space - information from the other spaces is either disruptive or disregarded - one or the other.  In the 'perfect' isolationist play, all of the players are working in-character, using only the information available in the emspace, and disregarding the necessities of, say, the playspace - they don't worry about whether Player B will be offended or whether Player C is getting enough spotlight - the emspace is as it is.                        </div>

The major difference that I see here is that you're putting the social aspect of negotiation around the gaming table at a remove from the game itself.  In the AGE Model, and in my own experience, the social aspect of the game is just as much a part of the rolepalying experience as the other considerations.  Yes, you have to worry about people's feelings and consider that the guy running the game has prepared a crapload of material (or hasn't).  These things are just as much a part of the game as the rules in the book, as far as I'm concerned.  Moving them to the outside of the equation only ... well ... isolates the creation of the emspace as the only valid social intercourse during the game.
<blockquote>It seems to me to be a term based upon treating in-character interaction as an Other.</blockquote>
Only if you consider emspace-centric play as the only possible isolationist play.  Thinking back on some of my games (particularly those played with my longest-running group), there were times when satisfying the needs of the playspace - like assuring a fledgling GM that she's doing OK at running the game - were more important than making sure that my character made all of the 'rational' choices for his situation.  I see it as part and parcel of being involved in an RPG (as does the model, really).
<blockquote>For example, we might picture someone who calls himself a "social gamer" who comes to the table mainly to chat with the other players about various real life topics.

That's a bit of a strawman, John.  If you're participating in a roleplaying game, you're being social - there's no real way around it.  You might call such a person a 'casual gamer' if you think that's necessary - but everyone at the table is interacting socially - it's impossible to do otherwise.  So yes - he's wrong, but that's not what we're talking about here, either.                        </div>

                            I see what you are getting at now--it is a more robust term than I first realized.  Let me see if I have a better handle at it by trying to rephrase a little:<br/><br/>An isolationist player may be able to have a 'smooth' immersion-like experience, but only under fairly controlled circumstances--circumstances that allow them to ignore the other elements of the game.  If they happen to have a group who is all on board with that, no problems.  If, however, they are in a group with a person who gets the most fun from (your use of the term) immersion, then they are likely to feel somewhat harried--the other player's style of playe tending to 'jar' them out of their safe zone?                        </div>

                            Hmm. The idea of the social gamer, and the social side of gaming is interesting.  I've been in games where the players make decisions based not on mastery of game mechanics, narrative, realism, immersion -- but rather the social ties that exist outside of the game world. Does the player with the cleric heal the fighter of that guy he doesn't really know, or the rogue of his best friend who invited him to this game tonight.  Does Player A's crush on Player B affect what they do in the game, and how their character's interact?<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who used to exclusively date women that he met through the Vampire LARP he was involved with.  I'm certain that would have a very strong influence on how he played that game.                        </div>

                            Brian got it. I was talking about overt social reinforcement. Like stepping out of character, and saying, "Dude, great roleplaying." Sure, the interactions are, at the very least pseudo-social, in play. But if you're playing your character, and not yourself, then the player across from you can't know what of his play you're enjoying, and what not. He can only know what your character enjoys. Which may be very different, since you're acting. And, since he can't tell which is which, he can't make any assumptions about what sort of play you enjoy other than very general ones. <br><br>Again, later the player can ask after immersion has been broken, and get an answer. So I don't think it's really that problematic, especially if this sort of thing makes your fun greater in the process. I'm just pointing out the difference. <br/><br/>Mike                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Isbo</cite>An isolationist player may be able to have a 'smooth' immersion-like experience, but only under fairly controlled circumstances--circumstances that allow them to ignore the other elements of the game.  If they happen to have a group who is all on board with that, no problems.  If, however, they are in a group with a person who gets the most fun from (your use of the term) immersion, then they are likely to feel somewhat harried--the other player's style of playe tending to 'jar' them out of their safe zone?</blockquote>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Hmm.  I dislike the term "isolationist" because it implies that play is "anti-social", which I don't see any basis for.  You're just interacting with other players in-character rather than meta-game.  It seems very peculiar to me that you could see someone chatting, hugging, and otherwise interacting with other players for hours and say that its not social -- and that the only "social aspect" is the congratulations afterwards.</blockquote>
The major difference that I see here is that you're putting the social aspect of negotiation around the gaming table at a remove from the game itself.  In the AGE Model, and in my own experience, the social aspect of the game is just as much a part of the rolepalying experience as the other considerations.  Yes, you have to worry about people's feelings and consider that the guy running the game has prepared a crapload of material (or hasn't).  These things are just as much a part of the game as the rules in the book, as far as I'm concerned.  Moving them to the outside of the equation only ... well ... isolates the creation of the emspace as the only valid social intercourse during the game.<br/><br/>No, I'm just saying that it's <i>a</i> valid form of social intercourse.  Whereas it seemed from before that it wasn't being included as form of social intercourse.  The importance of any given part of play is only as important as the participants make it.  So, if no one cares whether we stick to the prepared material, then   no, we don't have to worry about it.  If only one person cares, and everyone else doesn't, then the one person should hopefully bend on this point rather than making everyone else worry about it.  <br/><br/>Here's an illustration of my particular issue.  Suppose I and another player (Martine) are in a game, and we prefer that everyone stay in-character during the game.  Our enjoyment is largely dependent on this.  Now suppose you have two other players, Mark and Carol, who are more focused on other quality: say that the game follow adventure-story-style pacing.  So, Martine and I are happily having an in-game conversation, when Chris and Carol interrupt to say out-of-character "Look, this is getting dull.  Can we get to some action please?"  <br/><br/>Now, people's comments often seem to be that Chris and Carol are always justified in pursuing their preferences -- because by speaking out-of-character, they are being "social" and are speaking about the fun of "real people".  Whereas from the rhetoric, if Martine and I pursue our preferences and try to keep things in-character, we are guilty of "putting fictional characters above real people's fun".  That seems nonsensical to me.  Our fun comes from being in-character, and we are people who are just as real as Chris and Carol.  <br/><br/>To compromise, yes, Martine and I should to some degree accept breaks from the game which Chris and Carol prefer.  However, the converse is also true.  To help the other players' real fun, Chris and Carol should try to stay in-character more and pursue their interests without fewer out-of-character breaks during the game.  Being more "isolationist" can <i>enhance</i> the fun for other players.                        </div>
