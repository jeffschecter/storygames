I'm really happy with the book. It's sharp looking,  and has both excellent stories and a good game. I'm really happy to be able to offer it for sale. Now all I have to do to is say why you'll want to buy it.<br/><br/><b>What is it?</b><br/>The Drifter's Escape is an anthology of short stories and a role-playing game. Like most anthologies, there is a unified theme to the entries: they are all about the role of the American drifter, and his place in the American landscape. The stories and the game do not intersect except thematically. There are seven stories, ranging in length from three pages to nineteen, and they are all written by my brother, Jake Lehman. There is one role-playing game, and it is written by me, Ben Lehman.<br/><br/>Although I am certain that someone will correct me within the next 24 hours, I believe that the Drifter's Escape is the first product of its type: a presentation of prose fiction and a role-playing game as thematic and equal elements of a book, with a strong unity of purpose but without the stories serving as examples of play or the game being a tribute to the story's canon.<br/><br/><b>About the game</b><br/>Since I'm posting this in places that are interested in games, it probably behooves me to talk a little more about the game itself. The game is for three or more players (the largest group which I have played it with is 7, although it scales past that) of similar age and maturity. <br/><br/>The game takes 1-3 hours to play to completion, about 20 minutes of which is set-up. If you eat an early dinner, it can be played after dinner and before you go to sleep.<br/><br/>In the game, one player takes the role of the Drifter, someone who is coming into a new place, where they know no one, with the intent to leave rather than settle down. The other players take the role of the forces (The Devil and The Man) trying to get the Drifter to submit to their ownership of his life and soul. At the start of the game, The Devil and The Man control everyone but the Drifter. As the game is played, some people might redeem themselves and leave their control.<br/><br/>A recent player of the game described it as "a very quiet, very powerful experience." My play of the game has felt the same. The stories that the game produces are about ordinary people and their ordinary lives, but despite (or because of) that they are engrossing and often deeply affecting.<br/><br/><b>How to purchase</b><br/>The game is right now only available directly from me (although I will be selling it to both bookstores and game stores, and please contact me if you're interested in buying through a local store.) Please allow 4-8 weeks for delivery, longer internationally. Delivery times may run on the longer end: I'm waiting on the final shipment of books to be delivered.<br/><br/>The book costs $13, plus shipping and handling costs ($4 inside the US, $6 internationally.) Alternatively, if you can come by my house in Seattle to pick up your copy, you can waive shipping and handling.<br/><br/>If, due to your country-of-residence, you cannot use paypal, please contact me and we'll work out a payment method.<br/><br/>There are no plans for an eBook version at this time.<br/><br/>Purchase <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/index.php?page_id=250" rel="nofollow">on the game's webpage.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243128/#Comment_243128" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T14:01:00+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  2:01PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds very interesting.

It has the Lehmanese quality we've come to expect after Polaris and Bliss Stage.

I think that the American Drifter is a little bit different. Drifters are kinda a thing unto themselves, not really a metaphor for anything, not magical, but maybe encountering strange things.<br><br>Here's a thing my brother wrote about it.\n<blockquote><cite>Written By: Jake Lehman</cite><br>[...] Americans, whether the descendants or themselves immigrants, refugees, "freed" slaves, ripped-off natives or any combination thereof, share this common legacy: we have fewer living, effective traditions than perhaps any other people at any other time. Each of our generations has faced a profoundly different physical, economic and social landscape than the one before. Personal choice and personal responsibility are the foundation of our ethics. This is both a terrible poverty and an exhilarating freedom. Very often, we don't know what to do with ourselves, and shiftless people profit from it. But whatever mess we make of our lives, in the end, at least it belongs to us. Our king isn't Arthur, who united the Round Table; our king is Elvis, who dared to stand on stage alone and shake his hips. Many of our old songs are about choices and consequences, love, violence, sin and redemption, how and why and when to do the right thing.  They form a kind of moral folk calculus in the vacuum of strong traditions. The Drifter's short stories were based on those songs, and the game on the stories.<br><br>Then, there's a kind of traveling that Americans like to sing and write about that puts the traveler in direct connection with the landscape. Walking, hitchhiking and trainhopping are associated with poverty but also, since the beginning of the nation, with a spiritual abandonment of the self. There's an intimacy sometimes between the hitchhiker and his driver that excedes all the intimacy of settled life. They can laugh and cry together, reveal their deepest secrets, or lie, and the knowledge they will never see each other again frees them to be exactly what they are or want to be. Poverty itself is also revealing. To a person outside the social web of a town, people are free to be as kind or rude as they want, without the ordinary veil of manners. The "beholden" NPCs in the game draw the drifter into their schemes because they think that as a poor outsider he can be easily used. In their haste and greed, they reveal far more of themselves to the Drifter than they would to their fellow townspeople.</br></br></br></blockquote>\nyrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243300/#Comment_243300" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T14:58:10+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  2:58PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been eagerly awaiting this game.
