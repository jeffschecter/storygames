Either can earn victory points by eliminating their enemies, but these often aren't the most effective ways to earn victory points and this win the game.<br/><br/>Consider some of the scenarios from Mordheim/Necromunda (Games Workshop), Confrontation 2 and 3 (Rackham), or Malifaux (Wyrd Miniatures).<br/><br/>Many of these scenario victories are specifically designed to help tell a story through a sequence of miniatures skirmishes. I'd argue that Malifaux is fairly advanced in this regard because players can choose from a range of subgoals for their team's skirmishes, some easier to achieve (and worth less victory points), others harder to achieve (and thus worth more)...this certainly fit's the stake setting criterion. <br/><br/>Also consider that there are many ways to tell a story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DVUS" title="DVUS"><img alt="DVUS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3459/3796518754_5531e4a169_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DVUS">DVUS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255547/#Comment_255547" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T13:05:21+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  1:05PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been tinkering with this idea for months.  Granted, most of it has been at the back of my head and I have very little exposure to miniatures games, but I just love the idea of a tabletop wargame!  But, simply rolling dice and marking kills is extremely boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of story would you be wanting to tell?  I think that will greatly impact what you can do with a minis game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a start for a minis game that I've injected some story into, using the green and tan plastic army men.  Each one comes with a stat card with a personality detailed on it.  The soldier also gains some type of experience for each "battle" he survives.  I've also made about half the card with blank space to note cool stuff he's done, "bragging rights" I guess you'd call it.  That way, each soldier has a story attached to him.  A story that is <i>specific to him</i> and that likely will never be duplicated.  That's very basic story injection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm curious as to how deep of a story you're looking to tell in a minis game.  From the way I understand it, they're all more oriented to a battlefield view rather than a soldier view, so that would limit, somewhat, the options for storytelling you have.  Of course, that's just how I see it at the moment.  Someone else may come up with something that blows my opinion out of the water, and I'd love to see it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255550/#Comment_255550" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T13:29:32+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  1:29PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechaton seems to fall into this camp, but I only know about it third-hand.

In this case, the games tend to be multiplayer, multifaction affairs, much like the Raven's Nest games vulpinoid talked about elsewhere. Anyway, in those games ( various ones run by a guy named Howard Whitehouse and folks inspired by his games), apparently it's common after the game to declare an MVP ( by quick voice vote, IIRC). That's something I also tried to work in to that game I made and tested.<br><br>In Whitehouse's games, this may be a bigger sort of deal, as some of the players will inevitably be playing baddies who are there to threaten and menace and otherwise be PITAs for the Good Guys types, but which can't win in-game ultimately.<br><br>IIUC, this lets the players of the baddies ham it up and so on, and perhaps allows the Good Guys to do the same, taking different sorts of actions and attempting stuff in a way they wouldn't in a more standard sort of minis game rule set.<br/><br/>Edited to add<br/>I also played a pretty excellent games-with-minis with Elliot Wilen based on the Space 1889 setting and using the Mythic GM Emulator for the mechanics. This was, in many ways, much more like an SG, with high amounts of player input into the creation of story events and twists on the fly. I'd add that we played this essentially co-operatively rather than competitively. What competition there was, as it existed, was more of a sorta player-level "Oh yeah, but then what happens next is...!!!" kind of thing than any particular My-guys-shoot-your-guys kind of thing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255565/#Comment_255565" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T14:50:35+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  2:50PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We use miniatures in each of the four tactical mini-games in Diaspora, and each one has players doing story-gamey sorts of things through use of FATE aspects -- compels, tags, maneuvers, and declarations.

Of course, that's just how I see it at the moment. Someone else may come up with something that blows my opinion out of the water, and I'd love to see it!</blockquote>\nHere's a few games to consider...<br/><br/>Cadwallon (Rackham) was advertised as a tactical roleplaying game. It broke out the miniatures whenever a tense situation arose; that could be combat, sneaking into a buildng past guards, arguing in a local pub or even when things got tense at court. Conflict took into account a characters stance and their attitude to the world around them, as well as many more traditional miniatures effects.<br/><br/>Mordheim and Necromunda (Games Workshop) are more traditional miniature wargames, but they both have a subtle level of storytelling that develops over the course of multiple games. Each of these games offers a range of scenarios by which teams can achieve "victory". Characters develop and the team evolves as encounters are resolved. Why not use this to tell stories with an ensemble cast (eg. a crew in the Serenity/Firefly universe, a football team [consider Bloodbowl in the same vein], or the typical platoon of soldiers). Dogs of War (Rackham's version of Mordheim) works on a similar premise. Character develop through their improvements and their battle scars (so development can be good or bad, and often it pays to retire a character for the good of the team). Why do stories have to be told about individuals when the team often has a personality of it's own, derived from the relationships of it's members...? Wouldn't game engines like this be better at telling the grand stories of space operas and epics?<br/><br/>Malifaux (Wyrd Games) is a miniatures game that focuses on an individuals struggle to dominate a wierd west world (a fusion of steampunk, necromancy and wild west gunslinging). This is done with charismatic individuals leading teams of mnions of assorted quests, many of which don't involve fighting an opposing team at all.<br/><br/>That's not even touching on the world of indie miniatures gaming which can be just as bizarre and esoteric as the indie RPGs found around here.<br/><br/>I've got a couple of sets of miniatures games that focus on the telling of ongoing stories, the most promising of which is going through some revisions at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255570/#Comment_255570" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T15:14:24+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  3:14PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>Are there any 'story' miniatures games?</blockquote>\nThe Imagination Sweatshop was working on one, <a href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com/?cat=12" rel="nofollow">War Eternal</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255575/#Comment_255575" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T16:23:04+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  4:23PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No motion on War Eternal for 2 years?

I'm not entirely sure it actually needs much more to complete.<br/><br/>It does make me think of something else, though. Maybe minis rules incorporating SG type concepts/mechanics don'y lend themselves well to a longer page-count type product? Perhaps an anthology of rules sets might work better? A bit like the Norwegian Style book is what I'm imagining.<br/><br/>I have a fair few minis rules sets that have been independantly produced, and sometimes it seems like the designers are doing a fair bit of, not padding exactly, but definitely expanding of the simple core concepts to justify the thing as a sellable product.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>For those folks who have no idea what I was trying to get at in the earlier post about Megaminis miniatures, here's some URLs to catalog pdfs for the company;<br/>Check page 2 of this catalog for a set of Orc villager non combatants<br/><a href="http://www.megaminis.com/MEGA/CATALOGS/MegaMinis-MONSTERScatalog.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.megaminis.com/MEGA/CATALOGS/MegaMinis-MONSTERScatalog.pdf</a><br/><br/>They're also now putting out a similar elven villagers set as well. There's a pic on their main page<br/><a href="http://www.megaminis.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.megaminis.com/</a><br/><br/>Check out the following pages in this pdf as well (Villagers, Page 2, Halflings page 3,Townsfolk page 4 and King's Court page 9)<br/><a href="http://www.megaminis.com/MEGA/CATALOGS/MegaMinis-FANTASYcatalog.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.megaminis.com/MEGA/CATALOGS/MegaMinis-FANTASYcatalog.pdf</a><br/><br/>Great, so what's the big deal about all of those?<br/><br/>Well, essentially, I have a line of thought which goes something like "Toy Soldiers in=Wargame out"<br/><br/>(Which is fine. God knows wargames could benefit from an infusion of SG type mechanics and ideas. Or at least I personally would benefit from the combination. I guess I shouldn't speak for other folks on that point.)<br/><br/>I mean, it doesn't always come out that way. certainly starting with toy soldiers didn't make the Bronte sisters' story games all war all the time, from the accounts I've read about those. But it certainly encourages things in that direction.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a thought experiment, what kind of minis game would be interesting using something like those villager packs I've pointed to as the core minis in the game, and how would it be like and unlike more traditional minis games? What kinds of SG type concepts could be borrowed for that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255616/#Comment_255616" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T18:46:37+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  6:46PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a really interesting thread on this exact topic at the Forge, I think it was in one of the Birthday forums a year or so before S-G started: Something like, "Is a narrativist miniature game impossible?" or something.

That's what the game vulpinoid talked about sounds like. So do a few of the other games I've read about, and really the one I mentioned creating upthread ( although that one was only ever meant to be a one-shot, with no sequels). There is continuity between games, but the continuity at some very real level is on that core presenting player, rather than reliant on the other participants(although some people may reappear at the next convention to play again with characters they'd used before).<br><br>Of course, there are downsides to that, the same way that playing RPG one-shots versus RPG campaigns has a downside, in that they don't scratch quite the same itch. On the upside, like RPG one-shots, it may be easier to organize in some ways.<br><br>______________________<br><br>Getting back a bit to Sanglorian's initial post:<br>One of the common things I find in SGs that is hard to pull off in minis games is accounting for the way in SGs that players are often expected to pull in out of character ideas/story stuff, and are often also expected/allowed to have some sort of participation in building the initial setting and situation.<br><br>For a partial solution, one of the concepts I've experimented with is simply having a larger collection of stuff available to use than there is a plan for, It doesn't need to be a <b>huge</b> amount of extra stuff, mind you (although, admittedly, it helps). This collection of extra stuff is there for players to draw on for inspiration and add to the game as they choose and inspiration takes them. Which, I guess, is sorta proto-Vanilla Narrish ( which, as I understand the term, is about the ability of players to take the story in the direction that the group wishes as events develop in play).<br><br>I'll post a concrete example from actual play about that in a second. Basically, that toy collection is grist for story elements ideas, but also a limitation on them. The key thing is to have more available to you than you start out using, so you still have stuff to add in to play as you go.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255719/#Comment_255719" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T08:40:22+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  8:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, wait.

Around the same time, I'd been getting into the Space 1889 setting, but had no love for the rules. I'd also been collecting a bunch of Victorian era minis because...well, Ilike the minis and what the hell, why not?<br><br>So, deciding to combine this chocolate and peanut butter of stuff, we got together out at EndGame in Oakland, California to throw down and see what would happen.<br><br/>The part I brought:<br/>I admit, I brought mostly ideas about the setting, some minis from my collection, and a bit of evangelism about the setting. Elliot was to be the mechanical expert, as I'd mostly just skimmed the rules for MGME. I figured that was okay, as Elliot had mostly just skimmed the Space 1889 stuff by way of the wikipedia entry on the game and maybe another fan website or two I'd emailed him links to.<br/><br/>An aside about the Space 1889 setting:<br/><br/>Basically, S1889 is a Victorian Science Fiction/steampunk setting. The Great Powers of Earth have colonized the inner planets of the solar system the way they raaced to plant their flags around real-world Earth in the 1800s, getting there by way of big, clunky, bolts and brass ether fliers. Unlike the real world, the inner planets are largely inhabited by exotic life-forms. Venus is a young world full of jungles, low-tech lizard man tribes, and dinosaurs. There are multiple small outpost colonies of Earther Euro-Imperialists. The year is 1889ish.<br/><br/>There, now you have about the same amount of info that Elliot had!<br/><br/>The set up:<br/>I showed up at the shop a little before Elliot, grabbed one of EndGames wargaming tables, and collected a bit of terrain from their vast shelves of the stuff. In particular, I layed out a rather open table with some of their modular table base set ups to form a slowly rising landscape from East to West. I also grabbed a couple small hills, a prebuilt, prepainted goblin village made by Games Workshop ( basically three grass huts and a partial palisade), a Warhammer Fantasy Battle style Lizard man temple built by ( I think) one of the shop owners, and a few bits and bobs of various types, plus a couple of green, round felt cloth pieces that are useful for defining an area as heavy growth/rough vegetation.<br/><br/>For myself, I just brought a couple of palm trees and a box of lichen/reindeer moss, which is always handy.<br/><br/>The minis collection:<br/><br/>About a 20 prepainted D&amp;D minis of various kobolds, lizardmen, troglodytes and whatever else was sorta lizardmanish and primitive looking. (One was some sort of hybrid lizard man/mindflayer type I'd picked up randomly in a trade. This turned out to be important in actual play).<br/><br/>Another 20 or so giant snakes, komodo dragons, and so on, to be used as smaller prehistoric critters.<br/><br/>Five or so prepainted Dino toys I'd picked up. there was a T-Rex and some kind of bronto type thing, and a couple of other plant eaters.<br/><br/>A box of Victorian Adenturer types. I don't recall the exact numbers, but let's say at least a dozen distinct "character" types, as well as a unit of 10 or so armed Naval Brigade Britishers who were pretty generic in their uniformity of paintjobs and poses. IIRC, there were also some German Colonial troops and a few character types for them as well.<br/><br/>What I brought, fiction-wise:<br/>Getting a little more specific with the actual situation at the start of the game, I decided the following things were important and presented them<br/><br/>1) The adenture/game was taking place out in the hinterlands, in a disputed area between the British and German Colonies.<br/>2) Rumors had been circulating that the lizardman tribes of the border area were starting to get aggressive (lizard men in the setting are actually usually pretty mellow)<br/>3) Explorers had reported back to the British outposts that they'd seen the ruins of some sort of ruined temple structure out in the area. Lizardmen are known for being very low-tech, and it seemed highly unlikely that it had been by them, or if it had been, their ancestors must have had a much higher tech and organizational level than the had currently.<br/>4) Some rather overly idealistic British missionaries had gone missing in the area<br/>5) The Germans officially claimed no knowledge of what was going on in the area, but hey, sneaky darn Huns! What's really going on?!?<br/>6) Someone with ties to the British colonial interests on Venus has organized an expedition to the area and has a airship handy to get the characters there.. <br/>____________________<br/><br/>So, right all of that is great, but then what and how does it tie in to more SG-style play than traditional minis wargaming style play, right?<br/><br/>Well, first off, that's pretty much all I had.<br/><br/>We had character minis, but no characters yet, nor did I know the mix of characters that would be used. I also didn't have a plot or general idea of the direction things wold go, although I did have a mental storage bank of cliches that I'd want to work in if I could. I didn't know which ones would be usable yet, however, and some of that would inevitably rely on the use of the MGME charts and what Elliot would bring along in his mental cliche toolkit as well.<br/>_______________________________<br/><br/>Getting started<br/>Elliot and I quickly established that we wanted a sort of jungle exploration movie, so we each ended up picking out two minis as characters, and also mutually decided that the airship had to go, as we had no model for it anyway and exploring on foot seemed a better plan. The characters, aside from our Redshirts in the Naval Brigade, were a retired British Officer with some sort of stereotypical hyphenated name, a drunken daredevil Aussie airship pilot, Teddy Roosevelt on a big game hunting expedition, annd Teddy's lesser-known butterfly enthusiast brother, Maynard Roosevelt. <br/><br/>Done and ready to go, we used the MGME to establish some initial facts about why the airship was kaput, and our column entered the Eastern side of the board in a treacherous, swampy valley adjacent to the plateau (the far Western end of the board) we'd been heading for originally.<br/>____________________________<br/><br/>And that's when things got chaotic. I don't actually recall all of the events, but after the initial, genre required dino stampede and run in with a T-Rex, the game essentially opened up as we ran scenes baseds on inspiration from the MGME rules-charts and the minis we had available.<br/><br/>There was an evil, alien, higher tech Cthulhu priest that became central to the plot, complete with a spaceship, freeze rays and horrific mind-control powers, useful against both lizard men and Belgians as well as Naval Brigade Redshirts.<br/><br/>There was Maynard Roosevelt captured by Lizardmen all Merry and Pippin style, only to end up making friends with them and getting the inside scoop on what was Really Going On.<br/><br/>There was our daredevil Aussie figuring out how to fly the captured Alien Priest's ancient UFO in time for the big showdown.<br/><br/>There was the surprise arrival of the (gasp!) Hun patrol...only to discover them to be Damn Fine Chaps led by an embarassingly anglophile young Lt. Lettow-Voirbeck, also out to investigate exactly what was going on out here in the hinterland.<br/><br/>A desperate plan to encircle and capture or kill the alien cthulhu priest at the big required sacrificial ceremony at the temple ruins, even while he was surrounded by his mind-controlled lizardman minions.<br/><br/>The Germans sneaking through an eerily quiet valley filled with obviously mind-controlled komodo dragons and giant snakes, to outflank the ceremonial area, only to come out without a scratch!!!<br/><br/>The unlooked for and timely arrival of a mysterious stranger who'd been stalking along after the party: Lettow-Vorbeck's jilted Swedish Cowgirl/Adventuress/Big Game Hunter Ex-girlfriend (the Victorian era's answer to the LSN!!!), who showed up and quite nearly saved the Good Guys' collective bacon once battle had been joined at the temple ruins.<br/><br/>In the midst of total battle chaos, badly wounded and nearly dead British Lt Hyphenated Name Guy managing to coolly line up his Webley behind the alien priest while others were distracting it, and blow it's alien brains out, thus saving the day.<br/>____________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Total play time, about 2-4 hours, with breaks for food, split over two Saturdays, and not counting set up or break down time.<br/>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>So yeah, the actual events of play, all of that stuff was coming in from the intersection of initial set up, the available toy collection including a bunch of unassigned parts, and the use of the MGME. <br/><br/>We started out with maybe a 3rd of the available physical stuff being meant for some sort of clear purpose, another 3rd or so being tied loosely to some sort of cliche or startup background (but without direct use), and the last third completely unassigned but available.<br/><br/>There was no set direction that this story <b>had</b> to take either. It might have turned to exploration. It might have ended up a showdown between the Brits and Germans. It could have involved some sort of rampaging T-Rex stirring up problems. (The presence of the lizardman/mindflayer hybrid had been a total accident, and ended up being a core part of the story after Elliot brought him in early in the first session and ran with it). Maybe it would have ended up being a surval story, or one of betrayal and greed about a treasure to be found in the ruins.<br/><br/>Who knows? I don't, and I suspect that if I put the original collection of stuff I brought together with a different group of people, we'd get a very different resulting story.<br/>___________________________________<br/>So, I don't know if that helps sanglorian, but yeah, there can be very open-ended, S-G style gaming with minis. I have this particular bit of actual play experience that says indeed that such is doable.<br/><br/>The question becomes more one of methods that work to do it consistently and how to work things like stake setting and player input into the constarints imposed by using little model people in addition to the individual mental toolkits of the players.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255730/#Comment_255730" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T09:12:42+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  9:12AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 9:22AM by Daniel H..">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Apparently its' covered here:<br/><a href="http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/specialcollections/exhibits/brontewritings.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/specialcollections/exhibits/brontewritings.htm</a><br/><br/>A sort of developed-by-accident toy play/story writing activity.</blockquote>\nThis part, thanks.

The answer there seems to have been pass the hot potato to the referee/DM. But is there a different way to handle it after we've seen GMless games for a while now?<br/><br/>MatrixGamer has come up with one solution in his games: Ask an "enemy" player to set a target number after you've described your one-sided stake and described supporting reasons, then roll and get a yes/no result. The thing happens or it doesn't.<br/><br/>Mythic GME doesn't have "enemy" players, and the system returns Hell Yes/Yes/No/Hell No rsults, but requires further questions to flesh results out.<br/><br/>But me, I'm interested in a style of freeform stakes ( and the issues surrounding them) that are more like:<br/><br/>Player A describes somesort of events until...<br/>Player B objects, and offers a different outcome<br/>Players A&amp; B ( and possibly others) negotiate stakes<br/>Resolution of Stakes, with one outcome clear about the way eents transpire, or at least give some authority to someone to narrate in those results with limitations (no undercutting of core concept of winning stake)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256281/#Comment_256281" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T06:25:03+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  6:25AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops. I got out Cadwallon last night and I may have overstated some of the mechanics. I was right in that each section of the city has a primary attribute, (Such as Pugnacity or Sleight or Style) but that actually governs how the NPCS in that section of the city react to threats and intruders. It is a cool mechanic for setting up the city watch or a roving band of thugs, especially if players are trying to lay low or be stealthy.<br/><br/>There also are Faith ratings for each section, and these are used to determine how effective certain kinds of magic are. They basically are Light, Dark and Neutral, and when you try to cast a specific kind of magic (and we are talking religious magic at this point, like a miracle) you can draw extra energy from the people and churches around you, so a section of city that worships a dark god will actually make it easier to cast dark magic. There is a mechanic called Temporary Faithful that allows you to convert energy from nearby fantatics into miracles.

The fact that there are 25+ players involved allows for a more realistic game dynamic, while the constraint of the miniatures ensures that all 25 aren't magically in the same place at the same time when something dramatic occurs.<br/><br/>(How many times have you been involved in a game where the following situation unfolds...Something interesting starts to happen, the player at the other end of the table who was at the opposite end of the city last scene suddenly says..."I pull out my sword"...."But you're not even there"..."Yes I am"..."How can you have gotten there so quickly?"...it leads to all sorts of tension on the table if not complete arguments.)<br/><br/>I'm not going to say in this thread that Destriarch's opinion is WRONG, it's a valid point. <br/><br/>The same thing happens in many regular table-top games, even in close quarters. With players describing things in certain ways and hoping that the other players on the table don't realise that their description of the scene is in complete contradiction to the GMs scene set-up. But hell, it also happens in live action games when time is slowed down for a combat sequence.<br/><br/>Miniatures are one of the few ways I've seen to circumvent issues like these.<br/><br/>This thread has certainly given me pause for thought, and has provided a new avenue for design opportunities. I'll try to work on something focusing story through a paradigm of miniatures when I get the chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256460/#Comment_256460" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-13T02:06:09+00:00" title="February 13, 2010  2:06AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Putting aside your preferred sort of game for a second, what sorts of game mechanics/methods can you see that would make a game with minis enjoyable?</blockquote>\nWell, if it's going to be about making a story with multiple characters, then there have to be legitimate and reasonably complex webs of interaction between those characters. Simple rules naturally, but many and varied ways in which they can be combined so that the strategy is good and deep. Perhaps this could even make use of interpersonal relationships, as in when two minis are actually lovers, or one has a dire secret that will doubtless be revealed during the story.<br/><br/>I'd also like to see some kind of mechanism in there that openly rewards acts of selfless 'One for All' heroism, such as sacrificing a miniature so that others might live. In fact, any rules that serve to reinforce common storytelling devices would be good. For me, if it's going to be a story game and not a wargame or a board game, it has to create plots that involve something more than beating people up.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, Vulpinoid, I don't think I've ever been in that situation. Once or twice someone has said 'I'm there' then the GM has said 'you can't get there in time', and every time so far the player has said 'Oh, ok then' and sat back down without a complaint. We must move in very different circles.)<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256595/#Comment_256595" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T00:54:55+00:00" title="February 15, 2010 12:54AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ash-<br/><br/>I think the web of relations part is what is interesting me these days.<br/><br/>I agree about the story element encouraging rules, too.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to come up with any universally applicable rules for that sort of thing with minis.
