Your stuff wears down and breaks, or you'll drop it while being chased by ghosts, or it'll be stolen from you by competitors, or you'll discard it to make room for something else. Mostly, your pack is reserved for treasure; as far as your useful equipment, you're going to be carrying that in your pockets and in your hands.<br/><br/>One of the best ways to survive will be to use stuff that's in your surroundings. Like MacGuyver. Only, I have no idea what sort of rules to use for that. I'm shooting for a grimmer and grittier mood than MacGuyver, but MacGuyvering is MacGuyvering, pretty much.<br/><br/>How would you handle it? Have you seen any systems that do, or do something similar, or could? What about that Ars Magica thing I hear people talk about, could it be hacked for something like this?<br/><br/>None of the system is set in stone yet. Although I think I'd like to use d20s.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196469/#Comment_196469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T16:19:31+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  4:19PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suppose there is a MacGuyver skill, and you can roll it instead of a Wealth/Resources roll.

Could work.<br/><br/>I also thought about going with the "what actually works" kind of thing. Like, if your guy has the Chemistry skill, he can do things like make explosives out of household chemicals. Thing is, should I tell you, through my game, how to make TNT and thermite with shit that you can find around the house? I mean, I could, but <i>should</i> I?

Most often, it's gonna be that there's another PC who might kill you. So you've gotta kill him back. All you've got is a car battery, some bleach, some nails, a claw hammer, and a phone cord; what do you do? You could just try to beat him to death with the hammer, but that's dangerous; you're pretty likely to get killed in direct conflict. So, better idea is to nail the phone cord in front of the door as a tripwire, such that the guy trips and falls onto some nails. And, as a fall-back, pry open that battery, hold your breath, dump the bleach in, and get the hell out of that room and any rooms it ventilates into, while it releases tasteless, odorless, poisonous chlorine gas.<br/><br/>The easiest way really does look like "Player says what he does, GM decides if it works," but I don't know how to keep that unbiased.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196699/#Comment_196699" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T14:23:57+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  2:23PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what the real problem is:<br/><br/>A.
