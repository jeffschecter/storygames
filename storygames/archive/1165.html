                    Right now, I am taking my subscribed discussions and bookmarking them so I can bring them up easily, but it would be nice if there were a way to filter on just the subscribed discussions.                </div>

                            Hmmm. Yeah, that shouldn't be too hard for the coder-fu unearthed masters of Vanilla.  I'll throw it past the forums and see what happens.<br/><br/>EDIT: Ahhhh, nevermind. Yeah, that might be complicated, as the back-end for the subsribed discussions forks off quite quickly from the front-end. I'll still give it a look, though.<br/><br/>Also, I'm surprised that Subscribe to Discussion is still there, I thought I took it out to see the effects of bandwidth. Currently the effects are negligible, though, so I guess I'll keep it around. Unfortunately it's not too useful as it doesn't tell you which thread was posted to, though. I think a lot of Vanilla installations presume slooooower paced forums.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
