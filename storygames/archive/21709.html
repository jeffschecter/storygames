If you boost an auto IRL you drive it with love. That could be someone's life savings that they've put a lot of work into.<br/><br/>I understand the metaphor to mean "treat it as disposable, take risks with it, don't hold on to it" and if that's what it means:<br/><b>Treat your entire prep that way.</b><br/><br/>If you NPC gets shot by the PCs before they find out the tragic backstory, or the PCs never find the secret room, or the PCs bypass the big battle, or they chicken out and don't enter a particular dungeon...that is fine!<br/><br/>Some people have this attitude to video games that they're not satisfied until every piece of heart and every secret door and every dialog branch is found. As DM, don't have this attitude.

Instead of trying to get everybody to do things my character's way, they accept someone else's idea and amplify it.  This creates some interesting interactions between PCs, especially if the idea turns out badly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
