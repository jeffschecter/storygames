The personas then try to deal with this situation; people describe what their persona is doing, and roll dice when dictated by the situation and stated actions.  The dice mechanics nicely model their unstable emotions, and will get everyone into more trouble than they started in (everyone needs to be ready to unflinchingly roleplay according to the dice results) -- that's what makes it a Tragedy.<br/><br/>You don't really need a GM to play it.  My group had no problem framing scenes by consensus and passing NPCs around.<br/><br/>Also, read plenty of Romantic tragedy novels.  Might as well start with <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.<br/><br/>EDIT:  oh yeah, everyone should totally play up their Problems.

I have to admit I'm none the wiser. I had a feeling that there were a shitload of assumptions about how to play, rather than just advice on how, so in that respect it's solidly old school. Still, I'm thoroughly convinced that if you can assume something, you can also put words to it, some way or other. And if it works, why not promote it?<br/><br/>Let me try to help with more specific questions.<br/>So, you just act out you characters and/or decribe what they are doing? Who decides when to test for the different stuff in the game, say fx. when to test for Rage or Oldness?<br/><br/>What's the right mindset for this kind of game if you were to describe it to someone? I read in a review on RPG.net that it's basically rules for live-action romance, is that correct? The photos in the rules indicate show both players "acting" and sitting around a table. If it's for LARP mostly, I've got no interest anyway.<br/><br/>Sorry for the barrage of questions guys - pointers to blogs/actual plays etc. are fine <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic" title="toilet psychic"><img alt="toilet psychic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic">toilet psychic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171932/#Comment_171932" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T12:26:34+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 12:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a normal game.

They were glad to hear that it was legit and we had fun with it. I had enjoyed making pregen characters for this game. Characters are a collection of problems so we had republican, addict poet/printer's apprentice; a sick, occultist gypsy; a naive lesbian dance hall singer; an ugly, deaf, pianist and methodist rector; and a puny, alchoholic, badly dressed waiter with improper longings for his sister the singer. I kicked things off with a funeral (an idea lifted directly from an old actual play post by devp) and the game quickly focused on two conflicts: the rector wanting to drive the gypsy out of town and a love quadrangle with the poet and singer competing for the affection of the a french artist's model and the waiter pining over singer/sister. The game ended with a pair of murders committed with a fork and a piano.<br><br>I felt like the system was a little overcomplicated or at least densely presented for what it was trying to accomplish (which is to seesaw the character emotionally and have each setback give rise to new problems, sort of a version of cocteau's infernal machine with outrageous romantic color.) I could have used a flowchart to keep track of the variations of rolling under/over rage, despair, oldness and the fallout from those shifting values. I did like how art and seduction and murder had their own two-step systems, and we lumped preaching and telling fortunes under the art/seduction subsystem, which worked well.<br><br>I probably should have spaced the scenes out further in time so there would be more of a novelistic feel of strangers arriving in town and notorious rumors arrising etc- but I guess with out hour long session it was fine to lump the action into a few climactic and emotionally chaotic scenes.<br/><br/>After running this just once, however, I'm convinced it's a classic game in all senses and probably more influencial than I suspect.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171981/#Comment_171981" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T16:36:35+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  4:36PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, the rigid play structured or time management are not mentioned in either of the versions I downloaded and printed out.
