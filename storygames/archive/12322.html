It's set during the first manned mission to Mercury and it is looking hot. <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/dawn_light/dawn_light_roster_01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's the crew</a>.<br/><br/>We're sort of hacking PTA in a couple of small ways. <br/><br/>First, this season will be 8 play sessions (not nine, not five). A two-part pilot and six episodes. We're doing it this way for two reasons - we've found first episode spotlights to be pretty unsatisfying, and we've got six players. So we'll have a two-part pilot to build things up suitably, then one spotlight episode per player. Next week, the second part of the pilot, will be told entirely in flashbacks.<br/><br/>Second, I added "problem" to the characters. This is effectively a second issue and has no mechanical weight - it is just a thing to guide play and make sure characters degenerate and crack up along satisfying lines. Our beloved NPC astronomer, Galina Soboleva, for example, has "Hypochondria, eventually real illness, self-injury". So she starts out worrying about her health, and by episode eight she will be making herself sick or deliberately hurting herself. The pacing of that is up to the individual (in this case me, the Producer, and I'll move the NPCs along in tune with Protagonist issues). <br/><br/>So that's new and weird. Otherwise it is PTA with a lot of deep background - I went nuts with the research and tried to make the mission sort of believable. Everybody is chipping in nicely to flesh out the near future world as well. We've learned that this is a half-assed and underfunded "international friendship" political showcase, with some crew members placed because of politics rather than ability. We've learned that in the future, everyone hates and fears global Hindu terrorism. There are fringe groups in Japan that believe in something called "machine empathy". <br/><br/>One rule I'm trying to enforce is that when you frame a scene inside Chao Meng Fu Base, you have to include: <br/><br/>1. What it smells like currently<br/>2. Who you are bumping into/jostling/inconveniencing/overhearing<br/>3. What piece of equipment is in your way at the moment<br/><br/>In the first pilot they realized all the volatile water ice upon which the entire mission depends isn't where it is supposed to be. Joel, in a moment of genius, made his hard-charging Chinese mission commander's Issue "three months pregnant" - 12 months into the mission, with only two other dudes on hand, both fellow Protagonists. So that'll be interesting. There's also a sad love triangle between the astronomer, the geologist, and the command pilot. Already fault lines are forming along Sino-American nationalist lines among the crew, and along Support/Research lines as well, and along scientific discipline lines! The Astronomy people need the ISRU (in-situ resource utilization) module up and running and an auxiliary base on the equator, but that isn't happening until the geologists find ice, so they are going stir-crazy. Oh, and DL-2, the four guys who arrived early to set up the base, are also at odds with DL-3, the Johnny-come-lately beaker-pushers.<br/><br/>As a Producer, other than making the setting as well-realized as possible, I've had little to do - everyone brought Protagonists with serious goals and bad problems (mandating problems was perfect for this claustrophobic setting). So far, so good!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276309/#Comment_276309" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T06:36:13+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  6:36AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, this sounds wonderful!

I worked on fleshing out the NPC crew members and ramping up the uncertainty and paranoia. <br/><br/>I framed a scene for Dr. Akintola where an American "friend of his father's" persuaded him to take along a K-band transmitter and some proprietary data for later insertion into the base's computer, using Akintola's obligations to the chemical mega-consortium as leverage.<br/><br/>Later, I essentially repeated thew same scene with the same creepy dude talking to Rodriguez, the American command pilot. Same transmitter, same data, this time couched in American patriotism.<br/><br/>Then Flight Director Chen pulled the Chinese mission commander, played by Joel, aside and told her that the American's had planted a spy carrying illicit equipment on board. Probably Rodriguez, obviously.<br/><br/>I introduced three crew members who would be replaced by their less-than-stellar PC counterparts, and we found out why. The competent primary science officer/XO was injured in a training exercise (through carelessness on the part of the Brazilian geologist and MML jockey). Replacement: An unsettling media creature who doesn't know science.<br/><br/>The Korean primary astrophysicist and the Chinese ECLS officer both withdrew from the mission in protest when Commander Jie bucked the PLAN and refused to let politics get in the way of the science. She stood up to the Flight Director and won - threatening to take the Chinese backroom maneuvers public and unintentionally paving the way for two pro-American crew members (the new NPC astrophysicist and the PC ECLS officer). <br/><br/>A great scene where the drug-addled Ronald Luo persuaded his on-mission boss Dr. Adams not to run his final checkout blood test. He actually lost the conflict, but my brother was so eloquent in his wheedling that I had Dr. Adams agree, but hold a huge favor in reserve.
