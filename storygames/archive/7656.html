If you care to know, you know. Now, my wife and I have this thing we do, most nights.. We read together. More specifically, we read to each other. Even more specifically, I usually read to my wife. This will obviously be much more difficult with seas and continents between us. So I want to be able to record myself reading chapters, and put the audio file up where my wife can get to it. I am led to believe that I will have semi-regular internet access, but the bandwidth is utter crap. <br/><br/>So here's what I need to know: What do I need to record a decent quality audio file and put it into decent compression format so it won't be too massive a file to upload, but still be clear to listen to?<br/><br/>Inexpensive is best, but I don't require free, and am willing to pay a fair price to do this. I figure that, as this is essentially the same as podcasting, there are plenty of people who post here with good experience with this sort of thing.<br/><br/>So, is anyone willing to share of their experience in this matter?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170012/#Comment_170012" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T01:52:32+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  1:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Podcasters will surely chime in with all sorts of recording options.<br/><br/>I, for one, will suggest that you look in to the "speech specific" codecs, since you'll be recording only your voice: codecs like GSM (yeah, the one from the cellphones) and speex (which is completely free) are your best bets. The main advantage is that hours of speech will compress to very few megs of data. It has been studied for voice over ip and recording long speeches like talks at cons, actually.<br/><br/>Obviously you will need:<br/><br/>* a computer where you can install a bit of stuff (the compressor, mostly)<br/><br/>and your wife will need:<br/><br/>* a player that understands speex<br/><br/>For the latter, I think VLC (Video Lan Client) is your friend: it tends to play pretty much anyting, and speex is a free codec. But, also, there are handy directaudio filters that will allow her to use simply windows media player:  <a href="http://www.xiph.org/dshow/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.xiph.org/dshow/</a><br/><br/>As for the former, you'll need to record in whatever format (wav is simpler if you have space) and then encode in speex.<br/><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Audio-Codecs/Speex.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Audio-Codecs/Speex.shtml</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170027/#Comment_170027" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T05:41:16+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  5:41AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Easy Peasy! You could do this for free and still get excellent quality.<br/><br/>Start with a very popular free audio editing program, <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Audacity.</a> That'll save raw data files, but you'll need the <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Lame </a> codec downloaded and installed directly into your Audacity directory. <br/><br/>Once you get it converted, you'll need a place to upload it. I recommend <a href="www.mediafire.com" rel="nofollow">Mediafire</a> for it's easy to use interface and large file sizes. You have basically unlimted space, but each file is capped at 100 mb. If you wanted to spend some money, Mediafire's 7 bucks a month and that raises the cap up to like 1 gig or something ridiculous like that. There might be better file hosting solutions out there for you, but I've found this one pretty good. At a 100mb an mp3 that's been tweaked properly can easily be over 2 hours long. How long are these reading sessions?<br/><br/>Anyway, record it, export it (even edit it to drop out any stutters or background noises if you want/have time), upload it, and fire her off an email with a link in it.

Nifty!<br/><br/>I think the USB sticks might actually be easier to deal with, although there's a possibility they might get demagnetized or blocked by the inspectors, isn't there?<br/><br/>One other option I'd like to give you and that is Sony digital audio disk. I have a Sony recorder and it records to these little plastic squares that look like miniature floppy disks. But it would be ideal for carrying around in a hot climate and ideal for on-the-spot recording without needing a lot of infrastructure. Of course, she'll need one on the far end to hear it.<br/><br/>I wish you could depend on the Internet though, that would be the best method of delivery / upload - the Zoom H2 is pretty rugged digital recorder and offers stereo sound and saves in MP3 and saves to skinny little SD ram chips that people associate with photos, not audio.

When I do my podcast I post-process with <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">CDex</a>--nominally a CD-ripping application, but its has a huge range of options for compression, and has a little option called "Re-encode compressed audio files" that can cut your file size in half with the right options.  Since you're just doing raw voice, I'd recommend using VBR encoding with a max bitrate of 128kbps, mono.<br/><br/>As for an easy two-person massive-storage solution, one word:  Gmail.<br/><br/>(Yes, I know binary files double in size when they're encoded for email, but that doesn't matter on the upload end.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170136/#Comment_170136" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T12:00:11+00:00" title="September 19, 2008 12:00PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, thank you all. <br/><br/>I've heard of Audacity, but before your responses, I couldn't have remembered the name. I'll definitely check it out. <br/><br/>Speex is new to me, too. If I'm reading properly, it's main advantage is that it allows for really good compression (presumably with minimal quality loss), yes? That may end up being very important, so I'll look into that as well. If Audacity with CDex works, I'll probably go with that option though, as she'll probably want something in a common format that she could listen to while lying in bed, not requiring her computer. <br/><br/>As for sending of discs through the mail, I have considered the option and will be keeping it as a last-resort option for a few reasons:<br/><br/>1. I'm not sure how much of a pain sending anything other than folded paper through the military postal system would be<br/>2. Digital media in the mail may be something that the military is touchy about. Who knows what sort of classified material I could be sending?<br/>3. I like the internet. <br/><br/>Storage is not really an issue. Both my wife and I maintain websites, hers with several gigs of storage as she's setting up an online photo gallery for our family and friends. Uploading and bandwidth are the main issues, which will drive the decision I make.<br/><br/>For my purposes, this thread may be considered closed. Feel free to chime in if you've alternatives that I should consider, or any particular best practices. I may re-open the thread once I start looking into my options, or if I run into any snags over in theatre. <br/><br/>Thanks again for your quick and informative responses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170147/#Comment_170147" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T12:32:28+00:00" title="September 19, 2008 12:32PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2008 12:32PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lance, what about getting a computer camera and a private YouTube channel?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170201/#Comment_170201" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T15:26:55+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  3:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To accomplish what end, Robert?<br/><br/>I mean, I've actually already got a camera on it's way to Iraq with various other personal items..

It fits in the side pockets of my civilian camo shorts.

Having now established some bona fides, I'll drop some of the inside skinny.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Don't worry about the encoder.<br/>\nSeriously. It's not an issue. Encode to mp3 with LAME or whatever your recording/editing software of choice is. We hardcore heavy-hitters use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/" rel="nofollow"><em>Adobe Audition</em></a> but the previous suggestion of <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"><em>Audacity</em></a> is just fine. It's relatively simple, straight-forward, and free. And it'll do everything you need to do and more.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't save / encode at higher than 64k VBR.<br/>\nVBR stands for Variable Bit Rate. That just means that when it needs detail, it'll grab more bits. What it means to <em>you</em> is that you'll get the best encoding for your filesize in the pinch. There was a previous suggestion to use 128k, but honestly for straight-up human voice under mp3 VBR, that's overkill. You really don't need much more than 18k with the right filters, but for the drop-dead easy bare minimum, 64k or 56k is more than sufficient. (Some encoders / save systems use a "quality rating" for VBR instead of a strict bitrate setting; if yours does, you might want to try a few test readings with the Q set as low as 3 and see if that suffices. The lower, the smaller the file, generally.)</p></li>\n<li><p>There's a number of free storage sites if you want to just leave the files for her or transmit them to her.<br/>\n<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/" rel="nofollow"><em>Dropbox</em></a> is the one folks are going on about a lot these days, but <a href="http://yousendit.com" rel="nofollow"><em>YouSendIt</em></a> works just as well if all you need to do is send something. If you want an older, more established storage location, <a href="http://www.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow"><em>Libsyn</em></a> is the solid workhorse of the medium. It's not free, but it's low cost.</p></li>\n<li><p>Be sure to normalize / compress your recording.<br/>\nVolume levels go up and down while you're reading or speaking in pretty much any way when recording. It's not just annoying, it makes things hard to listen to. You'll want to get all your levels compressed before you put the file out there. <em>Audacity</em> has fiddly bits to do that built-in, or you can run a tool like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levelator" rel="nofollow"><em>Levelator</em></a> which a number of the faithful swear by. I get by via more integrated means, but it's a very fire-and-forget tool which may be exactly what you need.</p></li>\n<li><p>In a pinch, you don't need anything more than <em>Windows Recorder</em>, a cheap USB headset or desk mic, and the wherewithal to use them.<br/>\nSeriously, that's all. Everything else exists to make the recorded file smaller or make it easier to listen to. But everyone starts somewhere.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think what you want to do is great.

In that situation use Audacity because it's free. Likely you'll choose to record in a wav file, drop that into a program called the Levelator, which is also free. Levelator will do some audio magic and output a new file. Open that new file with Audacity and export the file to mp3. Now you have something small enough, but hopefully of decent quality to send to your wife.<br/><br/>To get the audio to your wife, you can go to a place that let's you store large files. Many email services won't let you attach something the size of an audio file to an email. For instance gmail limits you to attachments under 20MB. If you talk for 45 minutes to an hour, your file will be bigger than this. You could get it under this size, but unless you chat with Squidlord a lot, you will likely have something more crappy sounding than some of my podcasts. Heh. This means you'll want to look at Squidlord's suggestions above to get her the files, or look at the one I use called drop.io . I like drop.io because you don't have to sign up for anything and it has a fantastically easy but useful interface. Once you do that your file will be on the internet and she can download it at her convenience. Hope that's more clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
