In that game, there are written scenarios and the PCs have fixed resources/HP and fixed amount of treasure available in the dungeon.  The PCs want to get some treasure but push through as fast as possible, often skipping treasure to save time.  Because HP/treasure/healing is finite and time is not, the longer the overlord can draw out the adventure, the better chance they have of draining all the player resources and piling on additional monsters.  <br/><br/>Wandering monsters in RPGs serve the same function, time pressure.  They also make it more likely that players will go a ways into the dungeon and then retreat to heal up, then delve again (this time further) and retreat, making multiple expeditions into the dungeon rather than one, never-ending, expedition where they try to rest w/in the dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366321/#Comment_366321" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T13:52:18+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  1:52PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2012 1:53PM by Figaro.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wandering monsters also create the impression of more complex systems in an easy to use way, like many random elements do.

But sometimes many of the wandering monsters are drawn from rooms in the dungeon, so if you encounter them wandering, there will be fewer opponents in rooms.

It's just an abstracted heuristic for the complex idea that the beings living in the dungeon move about for various reasons and thus might actively stumble on the adventuring party of their own accord. The entire construct flows from this conceit as a compromise between complexity, handling time, prep time and other considerations. It's a tool that helps fulfill the dynamic parts of the GM's role better. A single GM can handle a surprising amount of fictional details and keep track of the immediate events in play to an exacting detail, but he has his limits, and in practice a GM cannot actually simulate a dungeon where individual creatures move about. The random encounter table is an elegant shortcut for this.<br><br>Of course, there is the viewpoint of considering the dungeon as a gameboard, in which case we can ask what are the most fun tools and ways of using them. The sort of OSR D&amp;D I'm familiar with, though, concerns itself with elegant and quick ways of setting up fictional situations that are dynamic and challenging while also being true to life. In this context whether your dungeon has random encounters at all depends entirely on the fictional set-up: if nobody lives in the dungeon, you probably don't have a random encounter table at all. If the occupants are lethargic and few, you perhaps only check for random encounters once per day instead of once per half an hour. If the dungeon's biosphere is very specific, then the contents of your random encounter table will be as well. If the dungeon only involves nine Nazg\xfcl and no other monsters, your random encounters clearly aren't "Schr\xf6dinger" creatures that might or might not exist, but you in fact know exactly who they are, where they came from and where the party can find them when they're not out prowling. It all depends on how the procedure and idea of dynamic encounters can be made to serve the GM's needs as world-simulator.<br><br>Many dungeons use the following sort of table set-up:<br>- One check per three exploration turns, or half an hour of fictional time.<br>- 1/6 chance of encounter per check.<br>- If an encounter occurs, roll its specific nature off a d6 table.<br>- Most encounters will be generic, specifying only what type of monster is coming.<br/>- Some encounters might specify that they can only occur once or twice or whatever, after which the monsters run out.<br/>- Some encounters might specify that they are monsters that can also be found keyed into specific rooms. Often the equivalent room will then say that the monster is out prowling X% of the time.<br/>- When the GM establishes that an encounter is in fact happening, he'll decide on how the encounter happens: which direction, how far (maybe some perception check or other randomization), why the thing in question is moving about in the dungeon.<br/><br/>That's the basic set-up. You can do whatever you want with that when planning adventuring environments. For an example, here's one of the random encounter tables from an adventure I wrote last summer, it's moderately different from the norm:<br/><b>Random Encounters for Lo-Chiang-Ze temple raid</b> - 1/6 chance every turn<br/><b>1</b>\tNo encounter<br/><b>2</b>\tNon-Combatants: 1d6-3 novices, 1d4-2 pugs, 1d6-3 lay servants, 1d6-3 injured.<br/><b>3</b>\tMonk mob: 1d6 (explodes) monks with no leader nor objective.<br/><b>4</b>\tLone monk: a single monk. 50% chance of character levels, 50% chance of pug companion. Determined to stop invaders.<br/><b>5</b>\tMonk Security Party: 1d6 monks with a leader of level 1d6 and 1d6-3 pugs. 30% chance the abbot is with them if alive.<br/><b>6</b>\tMonk war-party: 1d6 (areas 6+ and outside) or 2d6 (areas 1-5) monks of 1d6 level with double their number in 0th level monks and novices in support. 50% chance the abbot is with them if alive.<br/><i>Roll 1d6 first time around, then 2d6 pick highest, etc. until a '6' is rolled. Afterwards start counting back down, going from 1d6 to 2d6 pick lowest, etc. All monks are armed after they've had 2d6 turns to distribute weapons from area 9.</i><br/><br/>The context of that table is that it is to be used when and if the party decides to assault a certain temple. It's going to be a quick night-time operation if something, the temple is in the middle of a city and not the sort of place where you'll be sticking around. The temple is full of monks, too, and they're going to answer aggression relatively quickly and decisively once the alarm is sounded. If the adventurers stick it out for an hour or so, thought, the monks are obviously going to escape and maybe get city officials etc. rather than continue stupidly running around. The table is not intended as a mechanical representation of this social and military process, but it's an useful tool for the GM who needs to determine many things in quick order.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366371/#Comment_366371" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T20:18:22+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  8:18PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's all very helpful, Tavis and Eero!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366372/#Comment_366372" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T21:05:38+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:05PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can also just put shit like weird sounds or other evidence of activity on your "Wandering Monster" table to remember to insert clues at intervals.<br/><br/>Also, you can use nested tables to build tension, like so:<br/><br/><a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2009/10/wandering-monsters-mandy-needs-your_19.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2009/10/wandering-monsters-mandy-needs-your_19.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366436/#Comment_366436" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T14:02:09+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  2:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wandering monsters are an expression of what war theorist Carl von Clausewitz called <i>friction</i> in warfare: the "effect of reality on ideas and intentions in war."

Somewhere in that skyscraper/casino/corporate HQ/dungeon is the prize and you need to get in, get it, and get out before the law/monsters descend on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are careless or reckless you'll set off the alarms/traps and alert the guards/monsters.  So you got to be slow and cautious and methodical.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you are too slow, cautious, and methodical on your heist you increase the likelihood of being discovered, and once you're discovered, you're done.  Because the law has near infinite resources, and once the SWAT and the FBI and the LEOs and god knows who else surround the building...unless you're the Leverage team and have really generous script writers...you're screwed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly in a dungeon (done right) the monsters don't just sit in their labeled rooms waiting for you to kill them.  There are always tougher things farther in and farther down...they are the cops...and if you're discovered...eventually they'll reach out and munch you.  And just like the cops can bring overwhelming force to bear, creatures several HD above you...well, you hope your movement rate is higher than their's...or at least higher than the poor dwarf's.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this context then, wandering monsters are the guards on patrol.  Often they are drunk donut eating pushover guards...but even the fattest flatfoot can ruin your day if you're too noisy taking him out.  And sometimes...sometimes the guard on patrol just happens to be an ex green beret with ninja training and full body armor and then you're really screwed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366486/#Comment_366486" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T20:22:33+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  8:22PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Good stuff, people!<br><br><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Wandering monsters are one part of this pressure to get in and out as quickly as possible.</br></br></blockquote>\nWhat else is a source of pressure?<br><br>I can only think of diminishing resources.<br><br>Of course, there can also be situational pressures to certain dungeons, (brigadoon type dungeon that only appears once a century, be quick or be trapped; your homeboy is languishing in a temple dying of a rotting disease, curable by water from a well in the dungeon, better be quick, he's losing a limb a day)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366687/#Comment_366687" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T21:44:40+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  9:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://campaignwiki.org/wiki/DungeonMaps/One_Page_Dungeon_Contest_2011" rel="nofollow">One Page Dungeon Contests</a> have many quick-read adventures that include wandering monsters.<br><br>Lots of examples there!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366734/#Comment_366734" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T06:03:25+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  6:03AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should also be able to figure out from the table and the frequency of rolls, the average number of encounters and their likely strength. If you're including wandering monsters, you need to figure out why. Are they a distraction from the main prize? The main focus of the challenge? Padding? Also, players should be given the chance to avoid them. Any half decent organising will give the players some chance to not be caught but if they have to roll multiple sneak rolls, someone is bound to miss one. Do you want a fluffed roll to be the focus of the session?<br/><br/>Eero's table above is a superior wandering monster table, very much fitting in with the theme of the dungeon but many are a random mess.

So if the friction die starts as 1d12, and you roll a 1 which means friction goes up, it would become 2d10 of friction instead, which means a greater chance for friction to continue increasing.

This throws enough variance into the game and travel so it's not routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've broken down the charts in the back of Monster Manual II into "suggestions" for what the party may encounter with one die roll to determine frequency (common, rare, very rare, et. al) and usually two rolls to determine what random wandering whatever they encounter just due to the sheer numbers of options on the lists, though I did write a PHP program to roll dX (where X is whatever number of sides my die needs) to make it one click simplistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean that a first level party could encounter a triceritops in the jungle hills of the southern continent? Absolutely. Does it mean I'll actually make them face it? No, but I will put it "on the record" for a day they may not end up as part of the jungle floor and rolled the ogre they're actually going to meet instead. Rerolling to an applicable, appropriate encounter and scaling the danger to reward ratio up or down according the situation is up to the particular DM. I personally am not up for spending a night rolling up characters with my players just to kill them off due to the dictates of the dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWandering monsters in the "dungeon" are a different story. If we're running a "stock" module (something by Gygax et. al.) then there's a chart for that sort of thing in almost everyone, including the frequency of the rolls and what you may encounter. In a mission I've created myself it's highly unlikely that I'd ever roll for a wandering monster. I'd like to think I'd built in enough surprise to go around. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe long and the short of it is as the DM just because you rolled it doesn't mean it has to happen that way and just because you didn't doesn't mean it doesn't. Play an even-keeled game, roll the rolls you think need to be made, fudge the ones that didn't and have fun playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n$0.02                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/untimately" title="untimately"><img alt="untimately" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/085/n2DMX2JRS72SF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/untimately">untimately</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371857/#Comment_371857" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T20:45:15+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  8:45PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. To follow on what Zak said, random encounters is probably a better name than wandering monsters because A) there can be non-monster things on the table and B) monsters suggests combat, and that is not at all a given. Proper use of the 2d6 reaction roll is critical for interesting random encounters because that helps keep the referee honest about what encounters will be friendly, indifferent, or hostile.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Random encounter tables are also a very parsimonious way to provide info about a location. Like, these are the kind of things that might show up here. Which can also be used directly during play without needing to wade through paragraphs of descriptions and other text.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Regarding the "by the book" questions, frequency is usually location dependent (like, in this place there is a 1 in 10 chance every turn, in that place there is a 1 in 6 every other turn). So it might also be a way to communicate how populated an area is. Exact probabilities and timing are not important and vary from edition to edition of D&amp;D. Encounter distance generally begins 2d6 x 10 feet away in a dungeon or 2d6 x 10 yards away in the wilderness (if I remember correctly).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the Cook/Marsh Expert rulebook (page X55 and X57):<br/>\n<br/>\nMonsters are not only encountered in rooms in a dungeon where the DM has placed them, but may also be found wandering the corridors searching for food, patrolling or just prowling At the end of every 2 turns, the DM should check for the chance that the party encounters one of these wandering monsters Chances for encounters might be greater if the party is making a lot of noise, or less if the party is resting quietly in a room To check for a wandering monster encounter roll 1d6 and on a result of 1 an encounter will occur. The DM must deter mine from which direction and just how the encounter will occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nWandering monsters may be randomly determined or selected by the DM. The Wandering Monster tables below give a balanced mixture of monsters for the different dungeon levels. The DM may want to create special wandering monster tables for specific dungeons to reflect the types of monsters most commonly encountered in that dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile travelling in the wilderness, there is a chance that the characters will encounter creatures just as they would in a dungeon. The DM should decide how often encounter checks are made. Encounters are usually checked for once per day, but the DM may include planned encounters, or may make additional checks if appropriate. No more than 3 or 4 encounter checks should be made per day. The DM should keep track of time during the day, as it may be important whether an encounter takes place at noon, dusk, night, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
