Just a classic Law &amp; Order game with plenty of accurate and interesting emphasis on police procedure, department politics, modern forensics (and budgetary limitations), and other elements?<br/><br/>My side mechanic would be the Case mechanic.  The Case rating impacts the throw of the dice at the end of the session to determine how things went in court.  It has a base modifier based on the affluence and notoriety of the suspect, with high enough values resulting in even a minor mistake in police procedure allowing the suspect to evade justice.  Case is increased or decreased during play based on found clues, good/bad rolls, and errors in police work brought into play through character flaws.  For example, Elliot on Law and Order: SVU allows his temper and sense of justice to override his police work at times to the detriment of the case.  Lenny on Law &amp; Order sometimes slips up by playing things old school, or by focusing on "getting the guy" instead of building a case.  Ray's turbulent homelife and overactive penis cause his work to become more difficult.  All of these can ultimately impact the throw of dice at the end of the session to see how things turned out once the detectives have done their part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
