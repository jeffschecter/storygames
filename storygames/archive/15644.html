What you play to discover is how the characters will make a single decision, and what that decision will be.

"Illusionism" isn't just a definition. It's a way of arguing against a particular GMing practice, in which the GM designs the storyline. "Participationism", then, is a way of <i>defending</i> that GMing practice: it's a way of saying, hey, some players <i>like</i> the GM to design the storyline.\n<blockquote>2/ How would you design such a game to be compelling to players? any great examples out there?</blockquote>\nThe most obvious examples are Dungeons and Dragons and Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>And, then, a game like Trail of Cthulhu has your railroading built in. Cthulhu Dark does a bit of this, too.\n<blockquote>3/ If the plot has already been charted, what are the other fruitful voids? character development?</blockquote>\nYes, I think so.<br/><br/>But then it depends what you mean by plot. You can argue that, in <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, the plot is about what happens between player characters. Similarly, in <i>Montsegur 1244</i>, the plot isn't <i>really</i> charted, even though prescripted events occur, because the plot is what happens between characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354606/#Comment_354606" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T06:26:10+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  6:26AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably worth looking at genre emulationist stuff and immersionist stuff, too, as those seem like two flavors that often go well with participationism.<br/><br/>IIRC, the whole partcipationist concept was coming up right around the same time when genre emulation was beginning to be explored in ways that weren't simply modifications to physics engine type mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354607/#Comment_354607" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T06:29:24+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  6:29AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 6:29AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/toon/" rel="nofollow">1984</a> then?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354618/#Comment_354618" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T07:04:15+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  7:04AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Result of a time travel accident JD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354625/#Comment_354625" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T07:20:54+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  7:20AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would disagree about D&amp;D and cthulhu.

The mechanic itself started with Sorcerer (humanity!), My Life with Master, Dust Devils, Breaking the Ice, and Polaris and has continued from there, including things like Roanoke and even Agon, in a way.  These ideas obviously predate indie games, but "endgames" as a thing have sorta become an indie games trademark.<br/><br/>There's also a slightly different fixed endgame thing in Breaking the Ice (it does both!), The Mountain Witch, It's Complicated, Montsegur, Silver &amp; White, and most of Jason's games (The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach, Grey Ranks, Fiasco) that doesn't have a stat that counts down to the endgame, but there are relatively fixed numbers of scenes or events until the game is over.<br/><br/>There are games that have a fixed progression because they end when most of the characters are dead or the horror has been revealed.  Cthulhu games are partially in this tradition, as are more PVP or survival games like Mist-Robed Gate, Geiger Counter, etc.<br/><br/>The degree to which the events of the story are set from the outset is something we've been wrestling with from the beginning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354673/#Comment_354673" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T09:34:18+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  9:34AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the "Participationism" definition is a pretty terrible place to start if you're interested in plots being defined before play.

My currently-in-beta game <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a> is a GM-less game which involves a mechanical procedure for outlining a plot up front, but I'd say it has little to do with the illusionist/participationist play style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354693/#Comment_354693" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T10:43:21+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 10:43AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot about the "long endgame" of things like Shadow of Yesterday, Agon, and Apocalypse World, where -- if the characters don't die outright in play -- they eventually transcend, meet their fate, or retire to safety.

Traditionally this has been handled by scene framing and the gm setting up situations where the characters can shine, it's not that difficult for a gm who can read people and give them what they want as long as the players create characters who are clear archtypes.  i.e.  Player A makes a super combat killing machine, so you put them in situations where they have to kill tons of enemy's it's even better if you can make it look like the odds are impossible but miraculously the killing machine pc manages to pull off amazing maneuvers that save the day (a lot of gm fudging tends to come in to play here)<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; does the above well with the different character niches, most groups tend to have varied classes represented leaving each player an area of specialty.  Other mechanics that can work well are things like compels in the fate and fudge based games that get the player to go along with whats happening in exchange for more power to affect the situation down the road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354763/#Comment_354763" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T17:21:14+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  5:21PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one important question to ask is, "what is truly at stake in this game?" and then, "do the players get to decide how that shakes out, or is preset/decided by a GM-figure ahead of time?"<br><br>There's a big difference between <br/><br/>a) a Participationist game that's really just all about enjoying the scenery. (An extreme example might be the reading of a radio theatre play: you're still "playing a character" by virtue of speaking their lines, but you have no input at all into how the game turns out. I suppose something fundamentally pretty similar could be designed with a really heavy railroading style of play)<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>b) a game where certain elements of the story are set in stone, but the real matter of interest is still up in the air.<br/><br/>A good fiction example might be the movie Titanic: we all know the ship is going to sink at the end. But we DON'T know what's going to happen to the romantic leads and what decisions they will make, who will survive, etc.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call that game Illusionist or anything of the sort, just one with certain constraints based on future events. ("The ship WILL sink by the third act. Now, what do you do?")<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, what we really want to know is which of the player characters can survive the catastrophe, but the GM has secretly decided that they all will, except Bob... then you have some kind Illusionist thing going on. I think it could be fun if done right -- or at least done really well -- but once you take meaningful decisions out of the hands of the players (or the resolution system you've agreed to use), then to me it becomes a different activity: like some kind of performance art.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354810/#Comment_354810" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T04:10:31+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  4:10AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/paul">@paul</a> <br/><br/>I was indeed looking for something across performance and roleplaying.

"Illusionism" isn't just a definition. It's a way of arguing against a particular GMing practice, in which the GM designs the storyline. "Participationism", then, is a way of<i>defending</i>that GMing practice: it's a way of saying, hey, some players<i>like</i>the GM to design the storyline.</blockquote>\nNitpick: these are two different, though similar, GM practices. Illusionism involves outright deception on the GM's part that Story Before play is what's actually happening. Participationism is Story Before play, but everyone at the table is actively aware of the fact, and there is no deception.<br/><br/>Ivan, if you haven't read the current discussion about Story Before going on at the Forge, I highly recommend talking a look.

In fact, when I was introduced to the hobby, all my friends and mentors, as well as the publications and GM guides I read, recommended that the GM keep a strong hand on the game to make sure it goes as planned, but never admit to doing so. "Don't let your game get out of control!", "Make sure the players always feel like they have the freedom to make any choice they want," etc.<br/><br/>I'm happy to accept that there are other ways to play RPGs, but the implication that this practice doesn't exist or is being falsely described is where weird to me. <br/><br/>Then again, maybe that's not what you meant at all, in which case, fair enough!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354866/#Comment_354866" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T13:10:32+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  1:10PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2012 1:22PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ivan,<br/><br/>I have a slew of current threads on the Forge addressing the very question you asked in your OP.

The GM's plot can unfold exactly as intended while the character's fates ebb and flow based on the player's choices and the dice.  The range of risks and rewards is still vast, it just can't include anything that would ruin the GM's plot (like death).  You could look at it like this: "Your character WILL be at the final confrontation with the badguys, but what STATE will they be in for that?  Confident, determined, armed with guns and magic, with your loyal legions' hopes riding on you?  Or broken, naked and forgotten?"<br/><br/>Some Participationist/Illusionist GMs are actually happy to relinquish control of the Final Scene's outcome, so those guns and magic might even make a difference!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
