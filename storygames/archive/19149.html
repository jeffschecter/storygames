Probably Fate Accelerated Edition, though I'm feeling very fuzzy about what did and didn't come out last year. Also, there are a lot of games that came out that I've not read / played, so didn't think of listing. (Sagas of the Icelanders is definitely one of them.)<br/><br/>Played? That would be most of them. I tend to be decent at selecting games I like at conventions. Highlights include:<br/><br/>Matt Weber's Monsterwarts, at Dreamation. Every other game I played at Dreamation also rocked.<br/>Kevin Kulp's TimeWatch at Metatopia. I'm waiting with baited breath for the kickstarter.<br/>My Kerberos Club Fate game. I had wonderful players, and we ended the campaign when one moved away, hitting a proper, triple-marriage episode. I also started running Masks of Nyarlathotep for Call of Cthulhu and Eternal Lies for Trail of Cthulhu. Both are going well, due to a combination of my insane ideas about how to do game prep and the players.<br/>Fate Accelerated at Games on Demand at GenCon. Also, I got my dose of steampunk with Victoriana 3rd and Kerberos Club Savage Worlds. Victoriana 3rd did something very cool -- each character sheet existed in male and female version, and players could pick their gender. The point the sheets were making was: Yes, the world of Victoriana can be sexist, but you should never run a sexist game.<br/>The Build Your Own Larp in 24 hours from NELCO, where I was morale officer for the authors, proofreader, and last minute insertion to make the numbers. The larp is called The Night Queen Princess Fluffykins Passed, and it is an all-cat larp. It is an astonishingly good all-cat larp, dealing with mature issues that get trigger warnings -- public urination, euthanasia, forced sterilization, and drugs (such as catnip). The trigger warnings are tongue in cheek, sure, but they're also serious.<br/><br/>Okay, this is sort of a top five list, for values of five that are variable.
