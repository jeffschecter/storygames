Well, not counting miniature/skirmish-type games, which I've designed a few of, and those have no GMs. <br/><br/>But I'm not sure about designing an RPG or story game with no GM, and I'd love some input from people that have done it.<br/><br/>What were some of the big challenges? How do you write the rules when you know that there's no one person responsible for managing the flow of the game? I mean, sure, I can read a few GMless game texts (and I have done so), but I'm still wondering about the design process. <br/><br/>Any huge differences in the way that you approach the design of mechanics/resolution, the writing of text, the playtesting process?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376752/#Comment_376752" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T11:57:36+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 11:57AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just lost a longer post, but here's my bullets, based on where I'd selfishly like to see GMless design go.<br/><br/>1. GMless design is in its infancy; don't necessarily draw on other GMless games: do something new (maybe don't do rotating scene framing, for example).<br/>2. Draw on the premise of your game for inspiration. Don't start with making GMless rules; start with what the game is about.<br/>3. Consider not having all the player roles be "equivalent" or balanced. Asymmetry is a cool new area for exploration.<br/>4. Maybe start by developing a fun GMless style of play with one of your local groups, and then trying to formalize that into play procedures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

I used to want nothing more than to make these. The game that I got furthest on, besides Dog Eat Dog, was called Facing the Beast. GMlessness was only one of its like seventeen exciting new design approaches. It had huge problems and needs redesign, but one thing I decided on was that GMlessness needs to grow organically from the game. I also think the key thing to think about is what you actually mean by GM. Here are some of the things that GMs occasionally do in games:<br/><br/>* Set scenes<br/>* Provide opposition<br/>* Manage the plot<br/>* Keep the party "on track"<br/>* Keep the players on task<br/>* Produce extensive description<br/>* Require narration from players<br/>* Judge the quality of narration<br/>* Wield the power of life and death<br/>* Decide intraparty conflicts<br/>* Decide intra-social-group conflicts in real life<br/>* Provide and maintain the game space<br/>* Resolve questions not decided by the rules<br/>* Resolve questions arising from differing interpretations of the rules<br/>* Resolve questions explicitly mandated to the GM by the rules<br/><br/>This is obviously a lot of different game and social roles all stuck together, and I'm sure there are more. Which of these does your game need the most? Which of these are easiest to peel off and give to generic players, and which are difficult to do that with? Lots of indie games have already divested some of these, even with a GM ("judge the quality of narration" or "set scenes," for example). "Provide opposition," by contrast, is probably the biggest problem most GMless games have to grapple with. Figure out what the key elements are, and what your game needs to function.<br/><br/>edit: crosspost\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>3.

Games without a facilitator or GM can crash from a little detail that is ambigouosly phrased which you will not catch in just one playtest.Hi Fredrik, good to see you on this forum. You may remember we briefly shared a chalet at IndieCon in 2009 when you were in the UK to promote Montsegur 1244, which to my shame I still haven't got around to playing yet. Also, regret not being able to attend Fastaval this year, but hope to do so next year.<br/><br/>Ok, fellow-users, hand-shaking over. So, GMless games. Well, the ones I have experience of tend to be the usual indie suspects such as Fiasco and Umlaut etc., and Fredrik you're absolutely right, the rules need to be 100% clear, nothing can be left out because, in the absence of the game, even if the ostensible facilitator is another player, the game itself, specifically the rulebook, is effectively the GM.<br/><br/>A few months ago, along with five other gamers I played 2011 Game Chef winner, Forsooth. Fantastic game, hugely enjoyable even if you had to be a teensy bit familiar with the conventions of Shakespearean tragedy/comedy. However, it took us about half an hour to really get into it because, from the one-page rules sheet (I know, it was a Game Chef game and had not been published as such, so a mite unfair) there were a lot of things that weren't at all clear to us which we more or less had to intuit. Ok, we were all storygamers so were used to that sort of thing, but even so I felt the writer had taken a lot of understanding for granted.<br/><br/>Apologies to the writer of Forsooth if you're reading this; I don't mean the above as a criticism, just an observation that writers of GMless games need to aim for the greatest possible clarity. I should add that in GMful games too there is a need for absolute clarity*, but in those games the convention is that in the event of opacity the physical GM will either wing it or house rule it or otherwise alter the published rules to make the game run more smoothly. <br/><br/>*I know this from personal experience because, in the game I'm currently writing, I've often had comments from playtesters saying this or this in the rules isn't clear.I go Of course it is, look, on pX it says- Uh, hang on, no you're right, it's not clear.

Story-oriented games are easier to work this way, if you just define some procedures to limit players input and participation in order to allow every player have the same amount of spotlight. However things complicate when you go Tactical (not Gamist, boardgames are gamist and those rule) because you need to find a way to offer players a method to create interesting challenges. Of course, seems best option here is to go somewhat gamist instead of tactical, but that would limit the types of tactical challenges the players would meet.<br/><br/>You will also need to add a mechanic able to deal with player's more subtle choices (because in the best case scenario, players will come up with a solution that gives them an automatic win without dealing with the challenge directly.)  Of course that would depend of what kind of challenges the players could meet.<br/><br/>After a few attempts I've finished with a GMless game that still doesn't feel the same as a traditional one, which is part of the goal that I'm aiming to. I'm still looking for a particular strong mechanic to deal with players motivations, including their relationships with NPCs. <br/><br/>Sorry, i'm in the middle of a sort of sugar rush right now, I'm not even sure if I'm making any sense...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377044/#Comment_377044" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T17:11:41+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  5:11PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To my mind, design starts with imagining a conversation around a table. For a conversation, you need people to know when it's their turn to speak. <br/><br/>GMd games work really well because it's very clear whose turn it is to speak. Conversation tends to flow back and forth from player to GM and back, shifting players as the GM shifts attention. The only exception is conversations between characters, which follow the patterns of conversations between people, so everyone is familiar with that.<br/><br/>To design a GMless game you need to imagine how the conversation will flow around the table. How will people know when it is their turn to speak? You can use a formal turn structure like a board game, but I've found that that can result in more stilted play than you get from a GM.<br/><br/>It's not impossible though! People have free-flowing, multi-person conversations all the time. Think of a good multi-person conversation you've had, and what made that work. Chances are the same things will work in your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian" title="Malthusian"><img alt="Malthusian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian">Malthusian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377046/#Comment_377046" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T17:28:40+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  5:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has any one pointed at Fiasco and said, "See, there."?

This approach can generate the most innovative games, but has two caveats: it may not actually create a GM-less game (although if you are really being honest about your assumptions this is less likely than you'd think) and it may create a game which is too out there (making folks refuse to believe that they actually do what they do).</li>\n</ol>\nI prefer method 3, but I've used all of the above and there is a tremendous amount to be discovered from each starting point. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377106/#Comment_377106" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T06:01:06+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  6:01AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a GMed game, often you have one person who reads the rules.<br/><br/>Usually it's the GM.

And the list of MC moves in AW is close, but you know, sometimes the only thing that makes it work for me is the wealth of examples given.<br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>In a GMless game, divisions of labor is often decentralized.

The rules-teaching and rules-facilitating functions were traditionally conflated into the "GM" figure, and our traditional RPG rules-texts reflect that: they're meant as books to be read by the GM outside of the actual play session. I think we're already questioning this (see for example <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i> or Ben Lehman's <i>Animal Crime</i>), but really not hard enough yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377117/#Comment_377117" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T07:54:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  7:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the teaching + short, accessible texts is definitely a thing. Honestly, I think it's an improvement for roleplaying as a whole, not just GMless games.  Even most indie games are at least 100 pages too long to be really useful at the table. I really think almost anything worth saying can be said succinctly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377130/#Comment_377130" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T09:39:06+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  9:39AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

But I strongly recommend looking at Jason and Emily's article because it lays out exactly what general functions GM-less games perform. A game designer can then say: "Oh, I don't really want the players to roll in order to be surprised!" Then you work outward from there.<br/><br/>That's the way my mind works anyway: see what exists, and then just push that in new directions with your own creative departures guiding the design process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377166/#Comment_377166" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T12:25:24+00:00" title="May  8, 2012 12:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about rules as a list of instructions? Some of the designs I've been seeing recently teach the rules only when there's need for them. So you can give players a list of instructions / answering specific questions that help them build the game and the characters. For example, in the last design I was trying, I found out it's enough to point players that this is a fantasy setting and then ask them what threatens the setting (just one event, monster or NPC), then ask them for one hope (again a creature/other NPC/object/event or place) against that threat. Then a few questions to define their characters and a couple NPCs each and then proceed to play. <br/><br/>I'm still working in this set of instructions for my game but it's perfectly possible. Actually a lot of players tend to look for these kind of instructions first in every game they read: checklists fo making characters, checklists for the GM on how to make adventures, etc. Boardgames work with specific instructions as well, so I'm wondering why RPGs don't usually present the rules in this fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
