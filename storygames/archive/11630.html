It is definitely not a game that shows all its strengths in a convention game, but it doesn't show its ass either. We whipped up characters - a space biologist, a gambler, a rock star, a researcher/hacker, and an antiquities dealer. I wish I could have played the game across multiple sessions because some of the concepts would have had to be reworked as life on FreeMarket station requires some wrapping your brain around the way Flow and everything works.<br/><br/>The MRCZ was called The Pragmatists and their goal was to be successful and get Flow. Pretty straightforward. The first challenge was for them to make celebratory drinks using their new 3-D matter printer that they got through forming the MRCZ. It was a simple challenge, but none of them had Printing or any Interfaces or Tech to help with Printing so they struggled a bit here. In the end they failed the Challenge and got glasses of gray goo that smelled like burning tires.<br/><br/>The player of the rock star was, up to this point, playing his character like a bit of an in-your-face-jerk. There was another MRCZ sharing their HQ, a converted cargo container, with them, so he got the idea of getting them to drink the grey goo. Yeah. He got Frownied big-time which caused his Flow to tank.<br/><br/>The change in the way the player was playing the character was instant and dramatic. He immediately did his best to smooth things over with the other MRCZ, being helpful and friendly. They eventually revoked the frowny after he was contrite for awhile.<br/><br/>After that Cobblepot, the creator of the rock star (who was a blank), showed up and needed help. His MRCZ broke up and he needed to join a new one, so the Pragmatists decided to put on a show showcasing his talents and invite a bunch of MRCZ's to the show. The show was a success, some of the Pragmatists were able to socially engineer a MRCZ into accepting Cobblepot into their MRCZ, and much Flow was had, especially after Cobblepot sent them all Friend Requests. He also gifted the rock star with Axeaxe, a weaponized double-guitar.<br/><br/>The players got a little frustrated at one point I think, but I think that was because they had a hard time wrapping their minds around all the resources available to them. They burned some tech in the final scene in order to win the big Ephemera challenge (the rock show itself) and when they did they won easily and raked in the Flow.<br/><br/>The actual Challenges were a bit tedious, but that's because we were working from one hand-written deck that I wrote on index cards. When I get the actual cards from the Freemarket set and every player can have their own deck it will make things more tactile for the players. But no way was I hand-writing 180 cards.<br/><br/>I wouldn't run it again as a convention game because I believe it will shine in multi-session play where memories turn into Experiences, and the MRCZ grows, and the players figure out what they want out of the game and get a chance to affect the station.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259265/#Comment_259265" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T09:04:26+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  9:04AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I laughed out loud!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259268/#Comment_259268" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T09:09:38+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  9:09AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Ha ha, those losers are all mad at me!

It was pretty badass when the Knots &amp; Crosses (an anti-gaming wetwork MRCZ, ala the Realists from eXistenZ) came by with their samurai swords to grab a bowl of soba noodles and the users flipped out trying to hide all the gaming paraphernalia strewn about. There was also a great bit where the poker playing earthworm came face to face with a mob enforcer (also from the blue ball) who had retired to the Donut. Much shaping ensued and the two ended up becoming friends after a tense face off.<br/><br/>The Pandorans came later (pulled from a user's memories using the situation generator).<br/><br/>Also: Frownies! I tend not to give these out too often as, despite their relative minor penalty, they're seen in freemer culture like the nuke strike of social discourse. I think it's less the flow loss and more the stigma of having a big red frownie face hovering over your head for the rest of the session. Sure, I'll kill a sucker but frownies?

The whole Deathing thing just does not compute at all for me.<br/><br/>We weren't afraid of getting death'd; we weren't even sure they were wetworkers.  What we did know was that it was my character's ex-wife (who hated games for unspecified reasons probably relating to our disastrous marriage), her new boyfriend, and a pair of samurai swords.  That was more than enough to make it a stressful situation.  Besides, any member of an anti-gaming MRCZ might conceivably screw up our restaurant simply by refusing our food after we spent flow making it, or giving us bad reviews via thin-slicing.<br/><br/>My current thoughts about being deathed on freemarket is that it's like being beaten up.  It's unpleasant, you avoid it, it's enough to make you hate someone for a long time, but it's the sort of thing that just happens sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259841/#Comment_259841" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T06:55:34+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  6:55AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It can also result in your memories getting wiped out which is Not Cool.
