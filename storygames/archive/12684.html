I ended up facilitating the one game I knew how to do THREE times because there was so little else on offer. The lack of NEW stuff to try was a big disappointment, but a necessarily annoying consequence of the authors wanting to be in the dealer's room to hand-sell their games during the EXACT hours that GoD was otherwise running.<br/><br/>So, it was much diminished as compared to last year's experience. I suspect part of the blame for that may laid at the door of the new venue, the Crowne Plaza, with tiny, loud, crowded rooms compared to last year's much mire spacious digs that were given over to Pathfinder this year.<br/><br/>A half-hearted open call for volunteers is clearly an ineffective approach. someone needs to make sure that there are facilitators/GMs registered and committed to each slot... The book lists  GoD as a FORTY-EIGHT capacity event. Leaving aside that we only had tables reserved for 36, a much more robust selection of games, especially including some of the newer titles folks actively want to play would be a huge improvement. There was plenty of decent gaming, but a lot of it was in games people 'settled' for, not necessarily what they actually wanted. I love Fiasco, but would much rather have played in 3 different games than had to step in to facilitate it when we had such a lack of on-time GMs ready to go. I made the most of the InSpectres game I was in, but it also was far down the list from my first choice, as it was for everyone else at the table.<br/><br/>The Oddest thing that happened was getting chewed out by the Dresden Files guy when I arrived at 10 AM on Friday and asked what was up because there was NO ONE else in the room except his Dresden players, eager to drag him away from any sort of oversight role so that he could run the game. I was sure I was in the wrong place to start out... No signage, no games, no facilitators. Eventually enough people wandered in that we got a game going, and by the afternoon slot it resembled the great event from last year a bit more, but the process definitely needs a fluffier to show up early and set it up...<br/><br/>-Jim                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284806/#Comment_284806" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T04:36:33+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  4:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2010 4:45AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (edited on review)<br/><br/>Say what you want about the "Dresden guy", but Scott (that's his name) was one of the very few people trying to organize GoD at all, and he's been at it for months.  He was there ready to run a dozen games, but ran Dresden because there was a constant demand for it and he was the only one around who would do it.  <br/><br/>I spent Friday and Saturday morning over there and while we generally had more players than folks who could run games, it stayed busy.  We had six tables each seated for 8 players (of course most games in our world don't accomodate a crowd like that). The only time I saw them all full was when one was being used as a waiting area.  And some folks elected to take their game to the lobby for peace and quiet.<br/><br/>In the hours I was there I saw games of Dread House, Mecha, fiasco, Zombie Cinema, Spirit of the Century, Chronica Feudalis, and others get played.  I know that there was also a bit of Blowback.  The Design Matters guys did a great job of keeping GMs on hand and pulling people into fun games.<br/><br/>In the end, the venue wasn't great- the Crowne is out of the way, the room loud and hard to find.  And it would have been nice to have GoD run on Thursday and Sunday as well.  However the fault is ours- not having enough volunteer hosts and committed GMs upfront (months ago) means fewer sessions.  Not gathering enough tickets in years past meant a diminished presence and worse location from Gen Con. These are problems we can fix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284807/#Comment_284807" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T04:55:13+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  4:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2010 4:59AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>someone needs to make sure that there are facilitators/GMs registered and committed to each slot... </blockquote>this was done, but due to last minute problems, many of those folks weren't able to come to Gen Con or make it to GoD.<br/><br/>And for what it's worth, thanks for running Fiasco when I wasn't able to!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284814/#Comment_284814" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T06:45:00+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  6:45AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a game of Remember Tomorrow and watched a game of Dread House.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I went it was packed which was a delight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe room was not ideal but also not the worst.

Both days I came in around 2:00 and was able to slip into a game quickly.  <br><br>Thursday's was Shock; the game was just getting started and they were kind enough to let me join in.  Previously I'd been a little ambivalent towards the game (I'd read the rules but never played), but I came out of it wishing we'd had more time to dig into the various stories.<br/><br/>Friday's start was a little bumpier: there was a Fiasco game forming but it quickly became clear that there were too many people, and the other tables appeared to be in full swing already.  I plopped down at the table by the door to wait for something to open up.  There were a couple people there waiting for the MC to their Apocalypse World session, who never showed.  One of the folks waiting said that he'd never played the game but had read the rules, and would have been willing to try running the session himself, if he only had the book, which I just happened to have in my bag.  Go, team!  The guy who was watching over the room and collecting tickets joined in, a fifth person joined while we were setting up chars, and away we rolled.  The MC was really great, the players were into it, and I had a blast.  I simultaneously really want to start a regular AW game, and feel like there's no way I could run it as well as the dude who ran our session.  <br/><br/>I had come with a couple games that I knew fairly well (Fiasco and Zombie Cinema), just in case there was a void that needed filling.  Someone borrowed the Zombie Cinema game while I was playing AW. (My unhealthy urge to overstuff my backpack got a lot of reinforcement this trip.)<br/><br/>The room was crowded and a little claustrophobic, but that fell away when the games got going.<br/><br/>So one data point: this one participant had a great time, and I'm very grateful to the organizers.<br/><br/>.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284855/#Comment_284855" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T15:32:28+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  3:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love it if we could have a bunch of people donate the cost of all the general tickets, so that the event seems full all day every day.

I was just honestly wondering if I was in the right place, or had misunderstood the format.<br/><br/>By the time the later slots rolled around, there was certainly quite a bit more activity, certainly a testament to the community's ability to improvise and adapt. I'd just love to see the whole thing START that way, rather than lurch towards it as the Con progresses.<br/><br/>To be fair, the same sort of general disorganization and difficulty with getting people seated ALSO plagued the WoTC events I (tried to) attend, so it's not exclusive to GoD, I think it's more a symptom of the general lack of a specific protocol everyone agrees on in advance to make things run smoothly (a pretty common occurrence in all aspects of our hobby, to be sure, with its institutionalized Asperger's and premature presumption of shared familiarity).<br/><br/>At the risk of being pilloried, I have to say that as an outsider and a 'civilian' interested in PLAYING these games, that one of the barriers seems like it might be creators more interested in being in the dealer's hall to hand-sell their games and meet-n-greet than in actually facilitating play. I can't help but imagine that most of the authors would be far better served from a sales and marketing standpoint in making sure there's someone there to RUN their games (especially if that someone is them!) while leaving the F2F sales to someone practiced in that skill. At the very least, putting as much effort into making sure there's play of their game(s) happening as they do making sure their books arrive. I don't know whether the Blowback games that were run were the result of Elizabeth making sure there was someone there to run them, but that was one of the bright spots: a game debuting at the show that actually had several slots run. Eppy showing up later in the day to run Dread House was a good save for some of the late arrivals, too. It was a crushing disappointment to me that I didn't get to play either, but I didn't want to be a dick and go play and leave 4 people standing there with an empty slot, either.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Steve">@Steve</a>: The cheat sheet and playsets were a huge help, I can't thank you enough for providing them, they made it <i>possible</i> for me to facilitate (I didn't have my copy on site with me...)!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam">@Adam</a>: The 'change I want' is to see debut games, and interesting stuff I read about here, but haven't picked up for whatever reason run in multiple slots so more than just 4 or 5 people get to play it for the whole show... to give those of us who don't have playtest/limited pre-release access to all the stuff you well-connected folks consider old hat a chance to see what the fuss is about. It may be a Quixotic hope, but the lack of any opportunity to play, oh... Apocalypse World, Annalise, etc, felt like a big lost opportunity (at least for me, who showed up with a specific interest in those games and walked away empty-handed).<br/><br/>I feel like I can (hopefully constructively) comment on this year because I agreed on the spot to facilitate 2 full-slot sessions of the same game I had already played because it was the only one I knew how to run, and hadn't prepped anything at all. Part of my frustration was walking in excited to play, but ending up stymied by the lack of GMs and poor selection of NEW games. One of the other difficulties was a bit of... elasticity in the start times, which resulted in a confusing mess of games going off at odd hours. When participants, particularly GM/facilitators, walked in at 20 mins past the hour but we were already started, that was something of a frustration, to be sure.<br/><br/>Last year's practice of having GMs registered in advance for slots they were committed to, with sign-up sheets on the table, clear labeling outside the room, plenty of space, and a very wide variety of games was the thing that made me so excited about this year. I had NO idea how it all got organized, but now that I have some insight, I hope that I can be a help in making it work well at Origins. I know you guys are very much a punk rock/DIY community here, but this may be one of those times when we can help with the mission of spreading the love with a bit more specific advance planning. <br/><br/>Jeez, I sound ungrateful, but I really did enjoy myself, once we managed to get it going. I just think there's some ways to reduce the stress, really ratchet up the enjoyment and buzz factor of the whole thing, and make it into something that doesn't just run, but runs <i>smoothly</i>, and, not coincidentally, sells games.<br/><br/>And FWIW, I REALLY like the idea of going all the way and making it a truly collective event... I was going to suggest going that route at Origins, with an 'Indie RPG' ribbon ala the board game room or Loony Labs Experiment that bought an admission to the continuous GoD/Story Game(s) session going on in a dedicated room for the whole show. It's good to see I'm not way out on a limb on that.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284907/#Comment_284907" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T08:03:28+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  8:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2010 8:17AM by Graham.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was pretty bad.

We're local to Columbus and everything, so less stress for us than someone who might be traveling in. Too many people want to get into games at cons but cant because things fill up. Games On Demand can be a resource not just for the "DIY Indie" community, but for the more trad gamers I know too that just want to get into fun things. And what an awesome way to expose them to some of the cool shit we like too.<br/><br/>Scott, if you're gonna be at Origins next year, lets work together! If not, give us some protips! I know there's another thread about Origins Games on Demand, but I thought I'd bring it up here since we're talking about it. I would like to understand more about what goes into the process of proposing an event like this, how many people it takes to make it happen, and what all the technicalities are.<br/><br/>As far as my experience, my husband and I arrived around noon on Saturday, as such there was one slot available for us to participate in at Games On Demand, and it was the 2pm slot. I'm glad we were able to convince Dev to run Blowback for us, and was kinda bummed there wasn't more gaming happening there organically afterward so I could run some games. Some goals that I think would be cool to reach:<br/><br/>More spacious less head-achy loud rooms.<br/>Sign ups, so GM's could propose on Thursday "I'm running Fiasco at 2 on Saturday. Meet here if you want to play." Having lots of available options ahead of time helps people plan better, I think. <br/>More volunteers and organization of them! Everybody volunteers to run games at cons, I don't think this is any different.<br/>More time slots for us to do our thang, so we're not limited to essentially 4 gaming slots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284925/#Comment_284925" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T09:28:34+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  9:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to poo-poo on all the negativity here, because lord knows we need that; but my experiences with Games on Demand were pretty much perfect.

On the other hand it swamped out two tables pretty constantly and tied down volunteers to just one thing, 4 hours at a time. I personally would like to see more variety, but Dresden had huge demand. If it was always the same people I don't how happy I am with that. I wish they'd try something else after getting a game of Dresden, or let other people play Dresden.<br/><br/>At Design Matters we had scheduled times to be on the booth, at Games on Demand, and off the booth. This meant that there was always two people from Design Matters at GoD. But, crucially, that does not mean that all our games were available all the time. I'm cool with that. Annalise was represented at GoD but not all the time. Same with Mecha, Remember Tomorrow, Dread House, Blowback and so on. It sounds like Jim was there when Blowback was one of the games we could run. Awesome.<br/><br/>I was there for one Design Matters "slot" (Fri 4-6). Clint Krause had been doing Mecha before I got there and we then got some Dread House on for three people who'd wandered in "off slot" (i.e. they'd missed the 2-6 slot but we caught them just after 4).<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun and it was a nice pick up game that they'd otherwise have missed out on. It was fun for me and Clint too.<br/><br/>Down sides were the lack of white board to write stuff on (Hey, be here at 4 for Dread House, Annalise, etc.) or signage. I wandered around the Crown Plaza trying to find it and ended up in Union Station with room after room of Pathfinder. I may be rubbish at directions but this was clearly a step beyond my ability (or my willingness to ask the staff where to go)!<br/><br/>Eventually I did ask staff after making my way back to the Crown Plaza and the GenCon volunteer told me where to go, but added "there's no point though as they've already started."<br/><br/>I'd like games to be more than just the 10-2, 2-6 slots, and if we are offering two-hourly slots or something (hey, some games don't last 4 hours) then we need to communicate that with GenCon, so the volunteers can direct traffic our way. A bit like how the boardgames are come and play. So, ideally the GenCon volunteer would have said "hey, you've missed Pathfinder but try the Games on Demand, they have games starting every two hours with generics".<br/><br/>Scott and his wife were awesome in making sure we got any books and stuff that had been left lying around (especially Eppy's black Jenga set THANK YOU!) and giving us leaflets to direct people from the Exhibition Hall to GoD. Steve's leaflet was awesome. I also gave all my generics to Scott and the other guy watching the stuff at GoD.<br/><br/>So, for me there was a lot of good stuff and a lot to improve on.<br/><br/>Jen, Jay and I arranged a game in the Embassy Suites on Sunday during the day as we were without GoD. On reflection it was easier to find, quieter and closer to the con.

When did it run? As I said, it was one the games I came to the Con to play, but got bummed out when I didn't notice it being offered at any point I was there...<br/><br/>I do think that moving the GoD events entirely outside of the Con structure is misguided. If the community has a downside, it's that it can be insular and clubby, and removing the activities entirely from the Con book and ticketing structure will not help with recruiting new players or giving casual indie gamers a good shot at accessing the events. I really like the idea of being explicit about starting something new every 2 hours. <br/><br/>I'd also love to see some sign-up sheets or someone for the later Embassy Suites games for the facilitators and GMs who may want to play something specific later on, it seems like a "who wants to" list might be great.<br/><br/>Epi, respectfully, you showed up much later in the day at the point where things were actually hopping, with a game to run, as opposed to looking to play. It was much rougher at the start of the day getting going. I was really glad you showed when you did, though, and found a group that was looking to play. What I'm trying to get at is not "that sucked!", but "How do we make it that much fun for everyone from start to finish?" I suspect anyone who shows up with a game to run for folks will have a more positive impression of the endeavor than the players looking for games. I certainly got much gratitude heaped on me for agreeing to facilitate. DMs get all the love!<br/><br/>If nothing else, it's resolved me to learn to facilitate a half dozen more games by next year so that I can step up when it's needed, now that I understand the way it all works a lot better.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285046/#Comment_285046" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T21:23:03+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  9:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't GoD profit from having a definite section of the resources dedicated to pick-up gaming intended to tide over the slot openings and give people something to do immediately as they get to the area? Like, have one big table off to the side constantly running Action Castle, D&amp;D or similar low-commitment, easy-to-play games. This way the host would always have something to offer no matter when somebody came in, and the pick-up game could absorb extra people, iddle hanger-ons, people waiting for their session to start and people who didn't fit into a session. And when you need players for something else to get a full group, the pick-up table acts as a reservoir to strongarm people from into a "real" game.<br/><br/>The above has been my philosophy when I've done similar things here in Finland; you need to have something going on all the time, it's not nearly enough to tell people coming by that the next game maybe starts in two hours. Then again, I don't use scheduled slots when hosting the thing either, so it's a bit different in that regard as well - games just start whenever a sufficient number of players has been attracted. Games with easy procedures like Zombie Cinema, Under the Bed or such are valuable in managing the crowd and making sure that everybody gets to play, too, as those are games where you can show the group how to play and leave them to finish the session between themselves while you go guide another group or do other host duties.<br/><br/>Sounds to me like the problems indicated are nothing fundamental, just a lack of staff (always a problem in something like this) and a lack of dynamism that doesn't fit well with spontaneous group dynamics of a convention crowd. Prepare more games that can be entered and left "in the middle" and more games that can be taught to a clueless group in half an hour so they can play autonomously, and you'll find that the crowd can be controlled better. This in turn tends to translate into a larger crowd, which means better fungibility overall - more games starting and ending all the time, which means that the waiting times are smaller and the selection of games is better at any one time, resulting in more satisfied customers. For example, take it as a target to have a full third of the game activity at GoD be "dynamic" in the sense of not requiring a committed staff GM or being low-commitment pick-up gaming outside slot structures. That'll help in getting the time-slotted traditional sessions going better, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285055/#Comment_285055" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T21:54:24+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  9:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>Gregor, I was there for the entire day both days and didn't see Annalise being offered at any point.

He played/facilitated Remember Tomorrow, The Dance and The Dawn and Dread House while he was there. I guess that's what people said they were interested in playing when he was there.<br/><br/>I totally wish you'd let Nathan know you were stoked to play Annalise, though, and I totally wish GoD had been organised to have a better way of letting everyone know/voice what was available. Design Matters, for sure, should have put our schedule on display in the room so people knew who would be there and when, but we didn't.<br/><br/>Nathan got a game of Annalise on Saturday night (which I heard was great -- it was The Mountain Witch with Annalise) with some folks from out of town. That got arranged by e-mail before the con, and it's a shame that we had people excited to play it as a pick up and it didn't happen. I don't want us to have to arrange everything beforehand. Too much happens at the con to throw those plans out, or at least leave players at a loose end at times when a pick-up game with generic tickets would be cool.<br/><br/>Jim, I'm totally with you on the 2 hour thing. If a game goes for 4 then I think that's fine as it doesn't mess up with the 2-hour blocks, but a lot of our games can be run in 2-hour blocks easily. (And you can take a 2-hour lunch/exhibition hall break and still get some gaming in on the other 2-hour slot if you get back to GoD).<br/><br/>I've seen a GoD run really successfully in Wellington, New Zealand. They had a large white board and wrote up all the GMs willing to run and below it what they were willing to run. Someone would ask for what people wanted to play and they'd get matched up with a GM. Those left would find mutually interesting games based on the GMs left. It worked seamlessly for two days over a weekend con, and I got a load of varied gaming in (at KapCon last year I just went "off GoD" for two games, both of which were Indie as it turned out but on the main schedule).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285101/#Comment_285101" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T05:45:53+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  5:45AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite> I don't know whether the Blowback games that were run were the result of Elizabeth making sure there was someone there to run them, but that was one of the bright spots: a game debuting at the show that actually had several slots run.</blockquote>\nJim, I really appreciate that.

I think it's indicative, though, of the things to look at as folks consider how to fix/upgrade/improve GoD at GenCon. I think your original post was spot-on, and wanted to offer my perspective!<br/><br/>Design Matters had an organized presence at GoD, but it was the first year we've tried it, and we definitely learned a lot about how to do it better in the future.<br/><br/>We had a schedule at the booth for booth folks, but no schedule at GoD, and no signage or signup sheets or anything. So it certainly was the case that if you who to look for, you could find us, but if you hadn't met any of us before, we were just in the small, crowded, loud room - not optimal.<br/><br/>We work on 2-hour shifts for the booth, but the GoD games seem to fall into 4-hour slots, so folks would be showing up in the middle of ongoing games. Even when we had players available, due to the general vagueness of how/when to get players together and figure out what to play, it often happened that both folks assigned to GoD would play in the same game - and then, if a couple more folks show up mid-session, does one person just drop out of the game to run something else? It's an awkward situation for sure.<br/><br/>We brought books with us, but once all the tables filled up all the books got relegated to a chair in the corner of the room. So, when I was there I brought Annalise and had it in front of me, but once I started playing another game, I would return it to the general table, and then a game would start on that table and you couldn't see any of the books. Last year there was a small table that was just for books that people had brought to play, and I think that was really helpful.<br/><br/>Having some kind of white-board at the front of the room where GMs could "sign in" with their name, time they'd be there and games they could run would have helped a lot.<br/><br/>All of that said, I saw a lot of cool games getting played at Games on Demand - not only DM-related games (Dance and the Dawn, Remember Tomorrow, Dread House, Blowback) but also old indie standbys (Mike Holmes was running My Life With Master, Tim was running Hero's Banner, I heard folks talking about InSpectres), and other rad games (I saw Chronica Feudalis, Steampunk Crescendo and Zombie Cinema happening, alongside the Dresdan Files tables).<br/><br/>At my tables, we had players offering each other generic tickets, which was cool. I think having some kind of sponsored area (like the Rio Grande Games boardgame room) would be great, as it would resolve the issue of "proving" we have players via tickets, and also hopefully get put in a higher-profile location? Maybe? Of course, the issue is finding sponsors, but if someone could find out how much would need to be raised and what Gen Con requires for such things, I bet it could get Kickstarted out of this community pretty easily.<br/><br/>So them's some thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285135/#Comment_285135" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T07:55:50+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  7:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the cause for few "games that are out this year at GenCon" not being run at GoD pretty much lies in the fact that they debut at GenCon.<br/><br/>So, aside from the author, who the heck is going to be comfortable enough with the game to run people through it? Personally, I think maybe once in the past 4 years I've actually bought a game at GC and then actually tried running it that same weekend: I'm kind of anal about making sure folks have fun, so I want to be prepared, have read the book, be familiar with the game, etc.<br/><br/>For the "debuting at (read: near - two months previous to GC is still kinda late in the game) GenCon" set, maybe one alternative is to establish a pool of friends or aquaints going to GC who you can send demo material to well in advance so they can run 1-2 sessions locally. <br/><br/>Otherwise, I really wouldn't expect much from the New Games at GC.<br/><br/>LAST year's "new hotness" games (or games that debuted at Dreamation earlier that year), I'd expect more play from. <br/><br/>In the end, maybe more responsibility would be in the hands of the designer: *IF* they want folks to be actively playing their game at GoD (and that's not presumed, it's totally cool in my book to not be all obsessive about people playing the new hotness as it debuts), then they need to recruit and cultivate a willing "demo team" a few months in advance to make sure it happens.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285144/#Comment_285144" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T08:26:33+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  8:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the problems at GoD arise out of a lack of dedicated volunteers, and work being put in to schedule times and provide materials.

Many others made an effort to come ready to run games, but I don't think most of those (including myself) were committed to specific times.  Again, this can be improved in the future. <br/><br/>I think a bigger issue comes from different ideas about what purpose Games on Demand serves.  For some folks I think it's simply a free-play space (not unlike the Embassy at night) where you can get together with some friends and play a selection of indie games during the day.  Others- particularly those selling games at booths in the vendor hall- see Games on Demand as a place where potential customers can go to try before they buy.  It can serve both of those ends, but maybe not perfectly for either one.<br/><br/>If what we want is just a quiet place to play with friends, that can be arranged entirely outside Gen Con restrictions;  we take over a hotel lobby or set of conference rooms during the day, tell everyone we know, and show up to play games.  I'd imagine the Embassy would work for that even better during the day than it does at night.  It would probably be good to make arrangements with that location first.<br/><br/>In order for GoD to be useful as a sales tool, it has to be an official Gen Con event, listed in the schedule where folks can see it and find it.  It has to have enough space and dedicated GMs that people showing up to play a specific game can be accommodated.  And ideally, once the folks have played that game, their excitement can be redirected at some other games on offer as well.<br/><br/>Ideally, for both purposes, the event should be near the convention hall, easy to find, comfortable and well equipped with signs, whiteboards, etc.  The best way I can see to make that happen is to get Gen Con on board and show them it's worth supporting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285146/#Comment_285146" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T08:37:19+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  8:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 8:50AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>Of course, the issue is finding sponsors, but if someone could find out how much would need to be raised and what Gen Con requires for such things, I bet it could get Kickstarted out of this community pretty easily.</blockquote>\nI asked Gen Con for a list of sponsorship and marketing options before the con.  I'm sure pricing for GoD space would depend on what we asked for, but for comparison sponsoring the Gen Con Dance and the Author's Avenue workshops both cost $3000 and the Open Crafting room costs $900.

Scott did, too. Unfortunately, I lost my job at the end of June and started a new one at the beginning of August, so GenCon for me was not in the stars. I had to pull out, leaving Scott short a volunteer.<br/><br/>For GoD to really shine, it needs a bunch of people willing to run games. I typically prep about 8-10 different games and I think Scott does the same thing. <br/><br/>To improve GoD going forward, we should anticipate the games that will scream for play in every slot--games like Dresden Files, which we all should have known was gonna be the new hotness. Last year, it was Mouse Guard, I think. The year before, I think it was Spirit of the Century. If we expect there to be tremendous demand for certain games, we can get some help running them... probably even get some help from the publisher. That frees up the "on-demand" volunteers to run full slots and half slots of their prepped games.<br/><br/>The long demos are also particularly popular. Three games in two hours, or 5-6 games in four hours. These sessions let people jump into the middle of things and get a taste of a game (enough to make them want more, a craving that encourages them to go buy the game). I'd like to see more people running 2-hour demo sessions at GoD. <br/><br/>I love Eero's suggestion of keeping a "pick-up" game running. Games that are good candidates: Parsely, D&amp;D 4E, Zombie Cinema, Happy Birthday Robot, and even Pandemic. No one should ever leave because there was no game to play.<br/><br/>Spreading out across numerous hotel rooms worries me. We lose the centrality of Games on Demand if we do that. If the rooms are adjacent, it might work. <br/><br/>Also, while I love the idea of GoD after hours, I'm waiting for people to step up and be the GMs for those games. Mind you, I almost always end up running a game at night at the Embassy Suites, so I'd volunteer. But people generally want to /play/ at night, so getting volunteers is tricky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285162/#Comment_285162" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T09:39:44+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  9:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might have a central location for GoD "on hours" and then spread out to the hotel rooms for "after hours", using tweetybooks and faceyspaceys to coordinate, or whatever gadgets the young kids have today to tell them what gin joint is hopping...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285187/#Comment_285187" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T10:22:33+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:22AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also checking prices and availability for room block or meeting room with tables from the Embassy Suites.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285223/#Comment_285223" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T11:10:32+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 11:10AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Firstly: big thanks to those step up and organize (like Scott! and others!) and those who step up to GM, even if they had a game they want to play (like Jim! and others!). I've been part of several few free-play/ad-hoc RPG experiments and their success is driven by the generosity of those who step up and Bring The Fun for others.<br/><br/>I was part of 4 games (Dance and Dawn, Dread House, Blowback x 2); many of these slots were part of my Design Matters duties, which is interesting. (Next time, I would GM things even if I was unaffiliated.) Of note:<br/><br/>- "Dance and Dawn" and "Dread House" are both slightly lighter fare in terms of hours, and both were set up by mixing a few actively interested players + a few players who were possibly waiting for the next thing to do. In some cases that combo isn't perfect; however, I had some fun games of both of these and it was neat to see players discover that this game wasn't just what they were doing until the next Dresden Files slot, but actually a really good time. (I had one of my best games of Dance and the Dawn ever!)<br/><br/>- Blowback: It is important to know your game text! My first game was a little bumpy as I was feeling my way though (though the people at my table were cool). My second game felt pitch-perfect, and I just wished I clicked earlier.<br/><br/>In intensity/volume of interest in Dresden Files was a slight surprise, and kudos to the many GMs willing to meet the demand. There is a factor that when there is a popular game, some folks will be up for playing just that and not necessarily for finding Some Open Game to join in on. (But I enjoyed bringing those folks in.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285230/#Comment_285230" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T11:21:51+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 11:21AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really glad you and Nathan were able to pull those guys waiting on Dresden into your Dance and the Dawn game.

Also it was cool to talk to the author of Annalise, who was in the game too, about games in general.  I have purchased and read lots of the games being sold in the IPR booth before, but have had little chance to play, so it was cool to interact directly with creators like that and play their games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was Friday, Saturday I played Dresden Files, which was fun too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didnt really show up with playing any particular game in mind, I just wanted to play.

On Friday, we jumped into a game of Spirit of the Century that was just starting up (because I haven't had the chance to play yet, and wanted to get a taste of the mechanics), and afterward, went on to be the cool players in Dev's bumpy game of Blowback mentioned above. (No worries, of course - figuring out the game during your first run is going to be bumpy pretty much every time, and we were happy to be along for the ride.) On Saturday, I came down to run demos of Happy Birthday, Robot! for people, and then put together games of Zombie Cinema and Remember Tomorrow before heading out. <br/><br/>Overall, it looked like GoD was relatively successful, given what there was to work with. The smallish room was well packed almost the entire time that I was there, and everyone seemed to be playing something that looked fun. I think that there was some overflow, but in my experience, needing to turn people away is a good problem to have. When we didn't have anything to play, there was someone to either run something off the cuff (thanks, Dev!) or lend us something that we already knew how to play, but didn't have on hand (thanks, Joe!). I saw people being shepherded into games by whoever was staffing the room at the time (Scott?), and it looked like that was a stressful position to be in, but things looked like they were working out okay from where I was sitting.<br/><br/>I think the library of available games to play could have been deepened. Like someone said above, it's a difficult task to run a game - even a GMless one - the day it comes out. I didn't look at the table too thoroughly, but a couple of more copies of old favorites would have been a nice touch. We were also really wishing for Games on Demand to be open on Thursday on Sunday - we still managed to get games together when we needed to, but, yeah. Also, it was rather loud in there. It would get completely crazy sometimes, because people would get excited and holler (myself included at times), and everyone else compensates by getting louder, until the entire room is full of yelling for no reason, and the quieter players that we had were pretty sad a couple of times when they couldn't hear or be heard. But, that's going to be a problem in any space like that, so, I'm not sure what can be done there.<br/><br/>All in all, though, I thought it went well. I'd like some more public way to declare willingness to run/desire to play - like the whiteboard in previous years, or whatever - but it's still a fine alternative to hook up with random players when all your other buddies are playing or manning booths during the day.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and at the end of the weekend, I basically donate all my surplus generic tickets to Games on Demand. Some years have been better than others, but every bit helps, right? I urge others to do the same, if you enjoy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285301/#Comment_285301" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T15:50:18+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  3:50PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marc Majcher</cite>...

Our scheduled events this year were in the Hyatt and noise was a big problem too.  Last year's GenCon GoD was way better, and I was using it as my gold standard for background noise.  I'd like to think it was the high ceilings in the Omni that did it.  Is there any way to pick that as a location for next year, or a room similar?<br/><br/>Players griping that they were looking for something specific... I heard the same things this year and last year.  I like the idea of getting the publisher involved, but maybe it's just a matter of soft-selling the players on something else.<br/><br/>I love the idea of posting a "Name - Schedule - Games willing and able to run" sheet somewhere.  If I can help out next year, I'll bring one with me.<br/><br/>What "old favorites" do you think were lacking specifically?<br/><br/>Lastly, I just want to throw in and say that the type of rapid fire multi-game stuff Adam Dray did last year went over well with the people I talked to.  It might be easier to get a concensus between disparate players if you pitch "Well, let me show you all three of those options, just enough to get a taste for it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285378/#Comment_285378" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T04:30:33+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  4:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, gang. I was way too busy at the IPR booth to ever get over to GoD, but that will likely be different next year. <br/><br/>A couple of things: it is far more useful for a game designer to "hand-sell" his games at a booth, you can reach many more people that way. Game designers should seriously consider getting GMs they know to come and run their new games at the con, however. GoD is a great venue for that, but scheduled games are also a good way to do that. Game designers, think about your strategy as you go to the con. How are you going to get people that play experience that will really sell your game?<br/><br/>GoD is a great thing, and I would be really sad if it went away. It has its kinks, it seems, this year and years before, but I really appreciate the effort of those who have spent so much time and effort trying to make it work. Dresden definitely swamped it this year. Dresden sales were the single biggest at the IPR booth as well.<br/><br/>Speaking of IPR, I spoke with Darren on Monday before we left the con and he expressed a lot of interest in GoD as a complement to the IPR booth. If you are looking for sponsorship or help organizing, IPR would be a great place to go. If GMs are running games, IPR will clearly benefit, and they would definitely be interested in making GoD better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285509/#Comment_285509" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T11:32:32+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 11:32AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for the great ideas.

Using a computer, they could tell badged GenCon attendees - within seconds - of which tables in which rooms would be free until which times, if you wanted to do open gaming during the day.<br/><br/>And at night, most of the rooms were still open, 24-7, with usually NOTHING happening in them. I requisitioned them a few times to play RPGs, Zombie Dice etc after hours.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286335/#Comment_286335" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T14:08:14+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  2:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to see a Games On Demand that was about coordinating pick-up games on those empty tables, rather than renting a big room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287374/#Comment_287374" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T19:04:28+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  7:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a single datapoint, not intended to be indicative of anything but one random dude's idiosyncratic experience failing to play at Games On Demand this year.  I wasn't gonna mention it but y'all seem to be interested in how it went this year so hey, one extra datapoint might be useful to somebody.\n<blockquote>"I'm gonna do some Games On Demand this year cause I want to play more games than I buy.  Unlikely but a worthy goal.  I'm not gonna just wander around and buy things and get the occasional demo, I'm gonna PLAY!  YEAH!  <br/><br/>"Hmm... only offered two days, and on each of those two days, there are exactly two slots.  I can work with that I guess.<br/><br/>"Friday morning, ready to -- Oh crap.  Slept too late to get there by 10 AM.  Missed that slot I guess.  I'll hit the two o'clock... <br/><br/>"During the ensuing four hours I get kind of excited about Freemarket, and hear that Luke's running a game at 2, and people have failed to show up at such games before, leaving open slots.  I decide to show up at that one.  Hmm.. nope, everybody showed up, no room.  Games on Demand it is!<br/><br/>"Ok, it's super hot outside so I'll try and find my way there through the mall, which is mislabeled on the GenCon map for some reason... Eventually... I find my way... with all the speed I can muster, all things considered....  Eventually I make it there....  Twenty minutes late!  Well, it's only twenty minutes, and this is all pretty casual, right?  Hopefully not too bad...<br/><br/>"The nice fellow in the tiny faraway narrow room crowded with people explains that all the tables are full, though there are a couple people waiting around at the far table to see if they can get another GM -- they're plumb out of GMs.  I wander back and forth past the tables in the tiny jam-packed narrow room, don't recognize the games being played except for one or two (House of Dread, I think).  Rather than wait around I decide to head back to the dealer's room and shoot the shit with people at the booths.<br/><br/>"Saturday!  OK, this is it.  I'm really going to -- oh crap.  Overslept again.  The ten o'clock slot is out.  Will I hit the two o'clock?<br/><br/>"I have to think really hard about this one.  Cause my group leaves fairly early on Sunday, so Saturday afternoon is my last chance to have a nice unhurried time hanging out in the dealer room.  And I'd talked to somebody at one of the booths about a possible very short pick-up/demo game at one of the booths that I was really interested in.  It wasn't a guarantee, but....  did I want to sacrifice my last full afternoon at the con for whatever happened to be available in the jam-packed tiny room at Games On Demand?<br/><br/>"Nah.  I guess I'm not doing Games on Demand this year.  Bummer.  But I'm apparently too lazy to make the ten o'clocks, I blew one of the two o'clocks by showing up twenty minutes late because I wanted to sneak into a Freemarket game, and the other two o'clock, well... apparently I don't value play versus wandering around the dealer room quite as much as I thought, at least not when it's down to my last chance for an extended wander round the dealer room."<br/></blockquote>\nThere ya go.  I don't think there's probably anybody else at the con who had exactly the same combination of laziness and competing priorities that I did that hosed my plans to play at Games on Demand, but who knows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan" title="JoshJordan"><img alt="JoshJordan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6AKy_z4Epr0/TIfoTVksbnI/AAAAAAAAABg/OlTRzNj-YcA/s320/Icon.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan">JoshJordan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292271/#Comment_292271" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T12:39:02+00:00" title="September  8, 2010 12:39PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2010 12:47PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Oh hey!
