E.R. Burroughs' <i>John Carter of Mars</i> and <i>Master Mind of Mars</i> are obvious inspirations, less obviously Jack Vance's <i>Planet of Adventure</i> and S.M. Stirling's <i>In the Courts of the Crimson Kings</i>. The tech standing in for magic will be updated for modern sensibilities (more biotech and fewer levitating rays or radium pistols), but you can think of the setting as being much like Barsoom. This is romantic, even swashbuckling adventure with sci-fi trappings, not hard SF.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an eye-opening and very enjoyable encounter with Fate (in the form of <i>Spirit of the Century</i>) on Saturday, and found that it produces with game mechanics a lot of the results I have been striving for with play technique. It encourages character-players with incentives (and disincentives sometimes, go figure) to do what I have been urging them to do for twenty years, and has more success at it than I. This being the case, I am strongly tempted to use Fate-like mechanics (Aspects, Fate Points, tags, compels....) in my new campaign. I <i>could</i> simply graft those onto my favourite crunchy representation and resolution rules (<i>ForeSight</i>) the way that in SotC they sit on top of FUDGE. Or, considering that none of my players admits to an interest in using the crunch to good effect, I could simply adapt SotC with an appropriate skill list and perhaps Stunts. I do like the prospect of doing away with a choice of plausible values for attributes and skill levels that are realistic rather than relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way (with FUDGE or <i>ForeSight</i> as the resolutional substrate) the problem becomes choosing Aspects. Would it be best to<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 Let the players choose up to ten Aspects on the basis of their characters' lives on Earth, strike out the ones that are irrelevant to life on Mars, and let the players adopt new Aspects as they encounter new things and have "re-formative" experiences on Mars?<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 Have players choose only five Aspects /ab initio/, and then add to them organically as above to bring the total up to ten?<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 Ask the players to name a full set of Aspects from the beginning, anticipating developments on Mars?<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously the "book" method of establishing links among the players and of guiding the choice of Aspects is not appropriate here. I was thinking of asking for one Aspect relating to childhood, one to civilian life, one to training (in Egypt!), one to Gallipoli, one to France. Or two each?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the bees in my bonnet is for establishing mutual contrasts among the PCs, so that each has foils amongst the party, each Holmes has his Watson, etc. Having four players in my group, I thought of <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, the four humours, assorted schemes of four temperaments, and even the four suits of minor arcana in the Tarot. But the thought occurred that with Aspects that might not be necessary. Any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will I have to do to produce a Fate hack for planetary romance?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338171/#Comment_338171" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T05:12:26+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  5:12AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suggest Starblazer Adventures, which does a better job of damage and weapons and armor than SotC in my opinion.

How many aspects they have that relate to Earth depends on how quickly you are getting their asses to Mars. If you only imagine an opening Flanders battlefield and then wham they are on Mars, or if you start them off on Mars, than any aspects only about the WWI situation are going to seem pretty worthless.

Also as for creating foils as Storn said you already have a built in group dynamic and roles that the characters can take and niches that they can fill thanks to the squad of soldiers background. The great thing about the guest starring phases in SotC character creation is the way it establishes relationships with other characters so encourage that in character creation and have them create aspects about the other characters at least one and preferably two. The Three Musketeers thing will likely just sort of happen as players figure out what types of characters they want to play and what the other player's characters are like, so unless they all want to play John Carter clones they will likely choose roles to fill that will round things out nicely. <br>\n<br>\nAs for adding aspects later I would say keep two aspects blank and in reserve so they can fill them in once they get to Mars and start interacting with the Martian technology, society, and environment. This should really work for a John Carter style game where the suddenly discover that their "High Gravity Strength" allows them to make "Titanic Leaps". But it also works for things like "Custom Radium Rifle" and "In Love With The Princess". You might also consider giving them all a free stunt that defines their Earthman on Mars physiology or you can just let that be part of their high concept as Earthmen allowing them to invoke and compel it for things like high gravity strength, or barbaric Earth customs leading to interesting faux pas on Mars.<br>\n<br/>\nAlso for my Spirit of the Red Planet games one thing I like to do is put out a sheet of setting and theme aspects that the players can tag for the first time for free to really set the mood and tone that I'm trying to achieve.

In fact, they're all going to be infantrymen in the 1st Division AIF, which was raised in New South Wales, the state we all live in. Now, in the first place Australia's regional stereotypes are much less well-developed than American ones, and in the second place there have been vastly fewer Australian military movies and TV produced than American, so the military cliches are much less well-developed too. There are two reasonably good movies and a 1980 TV miniseries I would consider for military orientation if I were running a "First AIF" campaign, but my character-players aren't such research junkies as I, and I have promised not to make them learn any military history for background. The upshot is that tropes are not going so much to be my friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, one of the things that really appeals to me about FATE is that it makes a matter of game mechanics things that I have been struggling to get players (including two of these players) to do as a matter of player technique. Aspects and Fate Points promise fair to advance my agenda of decentralising authorial responsibility. I would like to give mechanics a fair go at advancing my other agenda: creating a party of player-characters designed for interaction and as mutual foils. I do have trouble with this, including one player who breaks too early from the collaborative process and starts channelling dogmatic statements about his character from the Fifth Dimension, and one who struggles badly for a character concept he feels happy with, and prefers character generation systems like that in <i>Traveller</i> that narrow down the choices and give him a clear lead as to where to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of taking four index cards and writing on each of them a clich\xe9 from the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble" rel="nofollow">Four-Temperament Ensemble</a>, along with maybe some starter suggestions from temperament theory. Then I would deal them out at random, and ask each player to write an appropriate Aspect on each card and pass the cards left, and so on until each player had made a suggestion on each card. Then I'd collect the cards, shuffle them, deal the out, allow players to trade, and ask each player to generate a character suggested by something written on his card. Something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338339/#Comment_338339" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T18:57:50+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  6:57PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2011 6:59PM by Agemegos.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mcellis</cite>I have run several SotC convention games based on John Carter of Mars called The Spirit of the Red Planet and the system works great for the setting.</blockquote>\nExcellent!\n<blockquote>How many aspects they have that relate to Earth depends on how quickly you are getting their asses to Mars.

At least, that's what I find when generating characters with traditional GP RPG rulesets. Do you find that Aspect-orientated character generation itself is enough to get character-players to collaborate? It seems to me that the players in the circle I have been playing with since 2003 (unlike those I played among 1986\u20132002) are very shy of having traditional GM responsibilities thrust upon them, and very jealous of their sovereignty over character design and play. At least, when these are presented as matters of technique they are. They seem a lot happier about it when it is presented as mechanics.<br><br>In this party I have one player in particular who, though he is enthusiastic for the idea, often has difficulty finding a character concept that provides suitable complementary faces to the other characters while still possessing an organic unity (this is the bloke who likes the game mechanics to give him a foundation for his character). It doesn't help that he is the most diffident of the group, and not sufficient quick to stake out his claim in character space during discussions, or to ask someone else to do something for him or give up something for him. One thing that would work would be to ask him to make a character first, and then get everyone to build their around him, but I'm afraid he might find that demeaning. Therefore and for other reasons I would like to have a go at game mechanics to reinforce player technique in this area.\n<blockquote>As for adding aspects later I would say keep two aspects blank and in reserve so they can fill them in once they get to Mars and start interacting with the Martian technology, society, and environment.

Ways of interacting with the story on Mars will necessarily be suggested and come as inspirations in response to particulars of the setting and to early events.\n<blockquote>You might also consider giving them all a free stunt that defines their Earthman on Mars physiology or you can just let that be part of their high concept as Earthmen allowing them to invoke and compel it for things like high gravity strength, or barbaric Earth customs leading to interesting faux pas on Mars.</blockquote>\n"Earth-man on Mars" is definitely an Aspect for all the player-characters, and it's going to be a useful example of how one Aspect can have both physical and social dimensions, and of how a good Aspect is both a weakness (and source of Fate Points) and a strength (opportunity for spending them). But I wonder whether it is adequate as a way of mechanicising low Martian gravity. Should I give the environment a "Low Gravity" aspect that can be tagged anywhere (and even by Martians)? Or could I improve all character's Might skill by one level (thus meaning that it can be used without Fate Point expenditure). Or just make everything lighter? What differences of results are the different approaches going to give me?\n<blockquote>Also for my Spirit of the Red Planet games one thing I like to do is put out a sheet of setting and theme aspects that the players can tag for the first time for free to really set the mood and tone that I'm trying to achieve.

That of course would be recklessly extravagant to make except for a very stable and long-running campaign. I'll see what I can do with printed sheets, a laminator, and dry-erase markers.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb" title="AusJeb"><img alt="AusJeb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb">AusJeb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338378/#Comment_338378" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T06:20:18+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  6:20AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Agemegos</cite>We have canvassed this issue.

Sounds like it will be a fun campaign.<br/><br/>I concur that it would probably be best to start with 5-6 Aspects based on their backgrounds, their military training, their time in the trenches, and their relationships to each other and then add Mars-based Aspects during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338545/#Comment_338545" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T21:55:52+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  9:55PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2011 9:59PM by mcellis.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Agemegos</cite>Yes and I would like to have something like that, but having each character the protagonist of a pulp serial before getting transported to Mars would not be appropriate.</blockquote>\nI wasn't suggesting doing full on pulp novels for each character just pointing them out as an example of the creation of relationship aspects amongst the group. In many of my FATE games I have players come up with relationship aspects at the table, and it works very well. For your game what I might do is ask the players to make an aspect or two be about their squad mates, and their place in the unit. Who are their friends and enemies? Who do they trust with their lives?

It seems to me that the players in the circle I have been playing with since 2003 (unlike those I played among 1986\u20132002) are very shy of having traditional GM responsibilities thrust upon them, and very jealous of their sovereignty over character design and play. At least, when these are presented as matters of technique they are. They seem a lot happier about it when it is presented as mechanics.</blockquote>\nHuh, that seems very like an unusual group to me. I've found that aspect based games tend to focus a lot more on the color and fiction of the character than the mechanics, saying someone is "A Mountain of a Man" rather than that they have an 18 Str tells me a lot more about their character. It can also be invoked and compelled in a lot of different ways. So when players are figuring out what kind of characters they want to play, especially if they are doing it around the table and talking about it I find it hard to believe that they won't create their characters that fill their own niches. You might not get the exact Four Humours or Musketeers break down, but they should still figure out how they fit into their role in a military squad pretty quickly. I get that your group might not be huge on War Movies, but there are some fairly standard tropes for dealing with fictional characters in a group that they should be familiar with if they have had any exposure to popular culture at all.\n<blockquote>In this party I have one player in particular who, though he is enthusiastic for the idea, often has difficulty finding a character concept that provides suitable complementary faces to the other characters while still possessing an organic unity (this is the bloke who likes the game mechanics to give him a foundation for his character). It doesn't help that he is the most diffident of the group, and not sufficient quick to stake out his claim in character space during discussions, or to ask someone else to do something for him or give up something for him. One thing that would work would be to ask him to make a character first, and then get everyone to build their around him, but I'm afraid he might find that demeaning. Therefore and for other reasons I would like to have a go at game mechanics to reinforce player technique in this area.</blockquote>\nCould you unpack that a little bit? I'm a little unsure of what you are asking for or what techniques you might need.\n<blockquote>"Earth-man on Mars" is definitely an Aspect for all the player-characters, and it's going to be a useful example of how one Aspect can have both physical and social dimensions, and of how a good Aspect is both a weakness (and source of Fate Points) and a strength (opportunity for spending them). But I wonder whether it is adequate as a way of mechanicising low Martian gravity. Should I give the environment a "Low Gravity" aspect that can be tagged anywhere (and even by Martians)? Or could I improve all character's Might skill by one level (thus meaning that it can be used without Fate Point expenditure). Or just make everything lighter? What differences of results are the different approaches going to give me?</blockquote>\nI wouldn't worry about trying to model the low Martian gravity this is a world of Planetary Romance and Space Opera, real world physics shouldn't enter into it much. The Martians who come from the environment will be normalized to their own gravity so no change is needed. For the Earthmen however you could raise their one or both of their Might and Athletic skills by +1 or +2, give them a free Stunt that allows them to move an extra zone or two for free, or you could just use their High Concept aspect as Earthmen to allow them to invoke it to do feats of high gravity strength. Or make it a key setting aspect of "Earthmen Exiles On Mars" and allow them to use as a setting aspect. You could do any combinations of these things as well, it really depends on how big of a deal you want the Earthmen's strength to come up in your game. Do you want it to be a constant mechanical advantage, do you want it to be something that is only highlighted at key moments, or do you want it to be a combination of those options?\n<blockquote>Great idea! Persistent setting Aspects and genre Aspects!</blockquote>\nThanks I'm quite fond of it myself, and it really helps set the genre and tone of my games.\n<blockquote>I have a vision of a layout on green leather-grained vinyl like a roulette mat. Setting and genre Aspects are marked in paint, and there are spaces to put out plaques with scene aspects, with players staking their poker chips like roulette players in a casino. That of course would be recklessly extravagant to make except for a very stable and long-running campaign. I'll see what I can do with printed sheets, a laminator, and dry-erase markers.</blockquote>\nThe full on vinyl mat thing might be going a bit overboard. I've found that index cards and sharpies also work great, and have also seen small dry-erase boards used on the table to great effect as well. They are especially great for encouraging your players to add to the fiction and the world. If you are using dry-erase markers and they make an assessment, a declaration, or a maneuver on a scene or character toss them the marker and let them make up and write down the aspect for you, it really helps to get across the idea that aspects are a shared part of the story you are all creating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338822/#Comment_338822" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T02:44:58+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  2:44AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2011 4:58AM by Agemegos.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mcellis</cite>I wasn't suggesting doing full on pulp novels for each character just pointing them out as an example of the creation of relationship aspects amongst the group.</blockquote>\nYes, I took your point. What I was trying to say was "Yes, those mechanics work just as you say. But since they are not directly applicable to this campaign, I am going to have to come up with some new specifics. Can you help?".<br/><br/>I have suggested to the players that we ought to anneal their character concepts a bit and work on translating them into FATE mechanics collaboratively. I have suggested that they ought to have two Aspects relating to their childhood and civilian life, two related to recruitment and training, and two related to the War since Gallipoli. I have also suggested that each player should come up with three incidents for which his character is known in the battalion, and that two of them ought to involve another PC, being agreed with his player. But I'm afraid that that is a bit feeble, and I would value suggestions from others more familiar with FATE.\n<blockquote>In many of my FATE games I have players come up with relationship aspects at the table, and it works very well.</blockquote>\nMy experience is all with trad games, or at least with mechanically-trad games that I have tried to run as story-based games by cultivating a story-based technique for character-players. I have had complementary characters appear at the table sometimes (which was great) and fail to appear most of the time (which was disappointing). And my efforts to contrive it deliberately by collaborative party design have mostly been frustrated by player's jealousy of their sovereignty over their characters. As things stand (I've played two session of <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, both within the last nine days, and have never GMed it) I don't know whether I can rely on FATE to give me better results in this area than I have had to date, or whether I still need to lean on the players to get them to notice one another when they are deciding what their characters will be like.\n<blockquote>For your game what I might do is ask the players to make an aspect or two be about their squad mates, and their place in the unit. Who are their friends and enemies? Who do they trust with their lives?</blockquote>\nGood idea! I'll do that.\n<blockquote>Huh, that seems very like an unusual group to me.

It's just a different mechanic than Attributes in a traditional game design.<br/><br/>My ideal group of character-players would collaborate on character design. They would get together, discuss what sort of characters would work well in the genre and setting, select a complementary set of the best ideas, and trade suggestions and advice on implementing those characters in game mechanics, adding specifics, and setting up contrasts and interactions. Like a team of writers  designing the characters for a TV show before they start writing the show bible. And they would do this even in a trad RPG, which I know can be done because I've seen it happen.<br/><br/>My current group do not do that. Two of them are from a circle that has been resisting my urgings along this line for eight years. The other are circles in which co-operation seems to have been focussed on making sure there was at least one each fighter, magic-user, cleric, and thief in the party, or equivalent.<br/><br/>A week and a half ago (before I met FATE) I got them together to brainstorm character ideas and design a party, but it didn't work very well. I would have liked them to toss a few dozen suggestions into the pot, discuss them, improve them a little, and see how they would fit together, then choose a team of the best, each player (except one) latched onto the first suggestion that met some minimum standard and started talking about that idea as "my character". Then they were thinking about their character and not thinking about anyone else's possible character, and the collaborative process collapsed. The fourth player came up with a character concept by himself, ten days later.<br/><br/>I know from experience what would happen in a trad RPG if I were to give a green light for character design at this stage, say, if I announced that we would be using GURPS and set a point budget. Each player would design a character without further discussion, and with no further thought to interaction with other players.<br/><br/>Are game mechanics in which characters are defined by Aspects rather than by numerical Attributes and Skills going to make my players come together and make their character complementary to one another? I don't see how they would do that.<br/><br/><i>Spirit of the Century</i> has mechanics for forcing character-players to consult one another about their characters throughout the character generation process. But it isn't Aspects. It's the novel-and-costars system. I think I need something like that, and I am asking for help to devise it.\n<blockquote>So when players are figuring out what kind of characters they want to play, especially if they are doing it around the table and talking about it I find it hard to believe that they won't create their characters that fill their own niches.</blockquote>\nWell, I am dealing with a group of players whose habits for generating characters are not to sit around a table and collaborate. It is to be given a specification by the GM, to agree on a very basic division of <em>functional</em> roles, and then to go away and work on their characters like angst-tortured artists in separate garrets.\n<blockquote>You might not get the exact Four Humours or Musketeers break down, but they should still figure out how they fit into their role in a military squad pretty quickly.

And the issue is not that they won't use tropes. It is that they won't collaborate. And they won't consider enough different tropes before choosing the best set. We came out of a meeting that was supposed to produce a party with:\n<ul>\n<li> Four characters who were all working-class. No middle-class or wealthy backgrounds.<br/></li><li> Three characters from the Bush and one from a mining town. No city folk.<br/></li><li> Three riflemen and a platoon sergeant (the miner). No officer. No gunner. No light-mortarman or stretcher-bearer or batman.<br/></li><li> No character with any education.<br/></li><li> Three characters inclined to go off on their own initiative and attempt things alone.<br/></li><li> Not enough variety.<br/></li><li> Only one intra-party interaction set up: one of the others biting off more than he can chew and the sergeant bailing them out.<br/></li><li> One player disappointed and annoyed that two others duplicated his character idea, and declaring that he was going to come up with something by himself.</li></ul>\nI don't think this clusterflub is going to fix itself just because the characters have to be defined by Aspects instead of Attributes.\n<blockquote><blockquote>In this party I have one player in particular who, though he is enthusiastic for the idea, often has difficulty finding a character concept that provides suitable complementary faces to the other characters while still possessing an organic unity (this is the bloke who likes the game mechanics to give him a foundation for his character).

I'm a little unsure of what you are asking for or what techniques you might need.</blockquote>\nOkay.<br/><br/>The players I have for this game are not engineers, and they have not been trained in brainstorming. They lack the technique of uncritically accumulating a large pool of ideas and then sorting through the results and refining the promising ones. When I ask them to do that they fall into old habits of latching on to a merely adequate idea too early, and focussing their effort on refining and defending it instead of producing others. They also lack the technique of collaboratively designing a party of several characters each of whom has a vivid individual style that is foiled by, and which acts as a foil to, other characters in the party. That is not the way they are used to doing things, and they lack the technique.<br/><br/><i>Spirit of the Century</i> impressed me by supplying game mechanics that succeed in getting players to accept some of the authorial power and responsibility of the GM. I've been trying without success to give it away as a matter of GM and character-player technique. By using game mechanics, <i>Spirit of the Century</i> can sell players power that I can't give away. In <i>Spirit of the Century</i> games, players will pay a Fate Point to do things that they refuse to do free when I make it a matter of technique. I'm impressed. I want to get me some of that mechanical mojo.<br/><br/>When it comes to character generation, <i>Spirit of the Century</i> has mechanics that force the players to pay attention to one another throughout character design: the novel-and-costarring mechanics. I'd like some mechanics to do that. And mechanics that slow down the players who tend to snatch and latch onto the first passable character concept they come by would be nice, too.\n<blockquote>I wouldn't worry about trying to model the low Martian gravity this is a world of Planetary Romance and Space Opera,....

But never mind the terminology. What will be the differences between your suggestions? If it's a bonus to Might and Athletics the PCs will be able to use it without spending Fate Points, if it is an Aspect they will be in practice no stronger than a Martian most of the time, and if it is a Stunt it might be one way or the other.

I don't know what difference it will make whether it is a character Aspect or a setting Aspect. Please advise me.</blockquote>\nOkay I'm going to tackle this one first cause I hope it has a fairly simple answer. I like to think of and describe invoking aspects as those moments in a book, or other story where the author specifically calls out a bit of description that helps or allows a character to do something. Howard's Conan using his "Mighty Thews" or his "Panthertine Grace" to battle hordes of enemies, or climb an unscalable wall because he was a "Cimmerian" is like the player spending a Fate Point and invoking one of their character's aspects to get a bonus. So any aspects that get invoked should have the same feel, and the Fictional Importance to the aspect getting invoked should be made clear in the game, otherwise why bother spending a Fate Point on it?<br/><br/>If it is a flat bonus to Might and Athletics then it will just happen all the time and it's great to be an Earthman on Mars. And all the characters are effectively getting one or two free skill points and if you are using a skill pyramid they essentially have one or two skills that are one level higher than they would be normally. <br/><br/>If it is a personal Aspect than it only comes up when it is Fictionally Important, i.e. when they invoke it and spend a Fate Point on it, or when it is an issue in the fiction, i.e. when they get compelled and earn a Fate Point on it. Either way the Fate Point economy is engaged when it gets brought up, and that means it is something that gets highlighted because they are Fictionally special and important. They still have High Gravity Strength all the time, but they only get a mechanical bonus when they highlight it with a Fate Point.<br/><br/>If it is a stunt then it will mostly work out that it is just a flat bonus all the time or in specific circumstances, but it allows a little more individual control and definition. Maybe on guy finds he is really good at using the low gravity to make tremendous leaps, while another finds it easier to lift massive weights on Mars.<br/><br/>If you make it a Setting aspect then it becomes important fictionally for any Earthman on Mars but mechanically the way I use Setting aspects is the first time it is tagged/invoked for the session it is Free, and after that it costs a Fate Point. So really I use Setting aspects to get the ball rolling and to reinforce the genre, color, and tone of the game I am trying to run. <br/><br/>Now if you mix and match then it is really pretty simple math to be aware of how much of a bonus will be available at any given time if they are willing to spend Fate Points and if it is Fictionally Important to the scene. For instance lets say that you have combined all of the above options and the player has a stunt specializing in lifting heavy objects. <br/><br/>The starting bonus of the Skill bump and the stunt give him a +2 on the roll which is pretty big in FATE as it is equal to spending a Fate Point, then he tags the Setting aspect for free since no one else has used it yet and gets another +2 on the roll. So because he is highlighting his character's strong points and the amazing strength that Earthmen on Mars are capable of he already starts with a +4 Great bonus for no Fate Points, meaning that even if he rolls a -4 on his fudge dice he is still going to generate shifts equal to his Might skill. But then he spends a Fate Point to invoke his high concept of Earthman and gets an additional +2 which is a +6 Fantastic bonus to his roll, then because if he has a Stunt based on being strong he likely has an aspect that has a similar nature and he spends another Fate Point for a +8 Legendary bonus on top of the Dice and Skill for the cost of only 2 Fate Points. An Earthman on Mars who focuses on being strong is suddenly Superman. <br/><br/>So if you kept it so that the only bonus was from an aspect and the player spending a Fate Point to invoke his Earthman high concept on the Might roll, it would only mechanically be a +2 bonus for 1 Fate Point. Earthmen on Mars get a bonus to strength because of their innate physiology when it is Fictionally important, but it isn't anything that a native Martian who has worked on being strong and is also willing to spend points when it is Fictionally important couldn't match.\n<blockquote>I'll give them a go, at least as a start. I will also work on a player placemat, with spaces for Aspects, composure and stress tracks, and a place to stack Fate chips. But I'll try it out on paper and playtest thoroughly before I ever think of making vinyl character mats.</blockquote>\nCool I think that is definitely the way to go before messing around with permanent vinyl playmats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338936/#Comment_338936" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T14:46:24+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  2:46PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, it's a matter of shared wartime adventures rather than Pulp novels.

But a mix of grim experiences in battle with others in the souks of Cairo and in fancy-houses in France would be more like real war-stories and might better encourage examination of character concepts like the larcenous larrikin who can "find" a fuel pump for the Battalion's truck.</blockquote>\nIf I was a player, I would want at least one phase of the chargen be the "downtime" of their military career, maybe even the Basic Training phase (officers and Sgts could be the ones doing the drilling, the novices doing their best to keep head above water).  Or what I also like to see one phase "Your Life as a Civilian before the military".  Sure, some folks join up at 16.  But plenty of soldiers in those days could be in their 30s or even 40s when they first join.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339716/#Comment_339716" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T21:52:12+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  9:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2011 9:58PM by Agemegos.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went with four-phase character-generation.

I do use a shortened damage track (as appearing in SBA and in some online enhancements to SotC.<br/><br/>I don't so much agree with Storn about SBA as a basis.

I use the five phase SotC system. The first phase is background for Rocket Corps/Earth characters, and Alien traits for the first phase for natives. In my case, I was setting up the game for 1 shots, so I emulated SotC with the final 3 phases being novels describing prior adventures on Jupiter.<br/><br/>Aspects in the early phases were selected knowing that they would eventually end up on another world. I think it's entirely in-genre to have aspects that are unique to earth that somehow parleys into an advantage on the alien world.<br/><br/>The "low gravity" nature of the Mars novels is something I didn't address since I wasn't using Mars itself.

Now, she is an awesome gamer, I had the privilege of gaming with her in a short Agon 3-part adventure.  But she had NO concept of 20s pulp adventure.  Luckily, I had just gotten a freebie from a friend who was working at Borders called Pulp Art (Robert Lesser, Paper Tiger pub), which broke down the various genres of the Pulp magazines.  Lots of pictures, covers in beautiful color.  Really awesome book, btw.  So I gave that to her and she flipped through it for about 5 minutes and went; "got it!".  <br/><br/>So, maybe share some images and references to get everyone on the same boat.  <br/><br/>As for the group dynamic, I think a lot of reassurance on your part is required.  "I'm not out to bone your characters" needs to be a mantra.  And one the things really, really necessary in emulating ERB or Pulp adventures is that the heroes do come out on top.  They are superheroes, or proto-superheroes.  Maybe point them to a few actual play threads of SotC where character generation is discussed.  I've got a sword and sorcery one going, might not be their thing... but some discussion about how the players crafted their Aspects together did come through.  <br/><br/>good luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339806/#Comment_339806" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T21:19:33+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  9:19PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2011 9:55PM by Agemegos.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mcellis</cite>If your players are actively fighting any sort of collaborative character creation with the GM or even with each other, then I don't think any variation of the FATE character creation rules are going to help your players collaborate.</blockquote>\nI think you are right, and so I have moved on. I'm not extra-pleased with the degree of collaboration on character design we've achieved, but I'm not going to fret about it any more.<br/><br/>To be fair to my players, I don't think that they are actively resisting, but passively. They have habits and attitudes so deeply ingrained and so hedged with rationalisations that half of them fall into them without realising that any such thing has happened.<br/><br/>There is a queer discovery in cognitive psychology and behavioural psychology in which people tend to increase the value or ranking of a thing that is "theirs" and especially that they have chosen. (See this <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html" rel="nofollow">talk by Dan Gilbert</a> at about the 9:50 mark, and <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions.html" rel="nofollow">this one by Dan Ariely</a> on the subject of opt-in choices.) If people choose an idea early in a brainstorming process they tend to get wedded to it, and rate it higher compared to fresh suggestions than they would have if the two had occurred together. I'm sure they are all sincere in thinking that they chose the very best ideas that came up in the collaboration sessions. But I watched them, and three out of the four in fact chose the first two ideas that came along.\n<blockquote>Have you talked to them about this issue and tried to deal with it?</blockquote>\nYes. In the case of two of the players I've been talking to them about collaboration for years, and they agree that it sounds like a great idea.The problem is that they don't have the technique for it, and I unfortunately started the process before I realised how much system does matter to them.<br/><br/>If I had had mechanics in place that forced them to think about multiple character ideas before choosing one, and that forced them to frame their characters in terms of mutual contrasts instead of using game mechanics to implement a Platonic character concept, I'm sure that they would have been happy to go through with it.\n<blockquote>Anyway I do hope the game goes well for you and your players though, cause it sounds like a terrific premise for a Planetary Romance game.</blockquote>\nI'm sure we'll have good fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339856/#Comment_339856" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-21T11:02:46+00:00" title="August 21, 2011 11:02AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>My radar is going off a bit.

Fists you can do without the benefit of weapons, so there is no reason to disarm an enemy or really, take the weapons skills.
