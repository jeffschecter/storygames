This is because nearly all fantasy worlds have something that our world does not have: effectively infinite energy sources. <br/><br/>Consider your local power plant, for example. It probably burns through a train-load of coal (or tanks of natural gas, or whatever) on a regular basis. This is all done to boil water, with the steam turning a large turbine to generate electrical power. Now picture this plant in a fantasy world:<ul><li>One captured fire elemental in the furnace eliminates the need for fuel entirely. And with it, the train tracks leading to the plant, a large number of jobs at the plant (like guys to shovel coal, or run machines that shovel it).</li><li>One captured steam elemental eliminates the need for the boiler entirely, animating the steam within the pipes in perpetuity.</li><li>One magical construct (e.g. golem, etc.) eliminates the need for the steam entirely, just manually cranking the generator.</li></ul>\nBasically, in most fantasy worlds, the second law of thermodynamics and the conservation of energy don't exist. <br/><br/>Now imagine that, say, ancient Sumeria and Egypt took advantage of this. Then thousands of years pass. What would emerge from this would be fantastic and awesome.<br/><br/>But it wouldn't be "medieval Europe plus wizards".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332657/#Comment_332657" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T07:32:17+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  7:32AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>This is Georgian London expect everyone is a Goblin.

Focuses more on players being creative both with their characters and what the environment provides them. I ran one full adventure, and am one session in with a sandbox-style campain using HQRPG, and its been a blast so far. It's fun to see the way the players view their characters not particularly through what they've accomplished, but what they've managed to survive or circumvent, while still being able to brag about it to other villagers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332660/#Comment_332660" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T07:43:21+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  7:43AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of other things:<br/><br/>Cities only have walls when defensive warfare is more effective than offensive. That is, once, cannon (for example) become able to knock holes in your stone walls, building stone walls becomes stupid. Instead, you spend your money and effort building cannon of your own.<br/><br/>In most fantasy campaigns, magic would have crossed the "my offense is better than your defense" a long time ago. No fantasy game world city should have walls, at least not stone walls created by human labor. You are better off funding your local magic school than building stone fortifications.<br/><br/><br/>Another ramification of magic is also the "problem" of <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=27582.0" rel="nofollow">infinite iron</a>, or whatever other material you can think of. Since thermodynamics and the conservation of energy don't exist, economics as we know it probably wouldn't either.

They had a fight on a boat, and the boat was mostly untouched with the way they fought, so they took it. Instead of using it to get to and from adventures they started to use it for trade in order to bring in more money. We also all played Everquest and had a business going on there were we sold "Fizzy Pop" , a restorative potion that we got from the Gnomes in that game. So it got ported straight into our table top game. From that point on we barely paid any attention to the game and paid a great deal of attention to running our business and making deals.By the end of the game they expanded their one ship trade business into a global Corporation with that owned several Inns, Bardic Bands (mostly parodies of stupid boy bands), Mercenary guilds, an Academy, a Fizzy Pop manufacture and distributor. They would occasionally make up "Employees" and we would play with them for a while. A traveling Rock Band that were actually under cover spies. Noble court politics with the main characters. Mercenary troupes trying to clear a path for new business expansion. Very interesting stuff.

The characters were a hoplite, and a storyteller.<br/><br/>The core conflict for the game involved the storyteller trying to impress an audience while a hired heckler sought to embarass him. It's a small part of a much larger game, but it was dramatic and interesting and there was nothing which would have prevented it being the main focus. The mechanics meant that the battle for control of the story (within the fiction) between the orator and the heckler was as exciting as a combat would have been. It was most cool.<br/><br/>The Dying Earth rpg springs to mind here too. At Cugel level that's basically about being a wandering band of vain confidence tricksters. I ran two adventures using it.<br/><br/>In the first the PCs wanted to attend a society ball, but they had been robbed and left destitute outside a small town with only one coach per day back to the city where the ball was to be held. Without money, how could they get tickets on that coach? Worse yet, there were five PCs, six places on the coach but four tickets had already been sold.<br/><br/>There was one fight, but only one and the PC lost it. The rest was unlikely schemes and desperate pleadings for the fantasy equivalent of a bus ticket.<br/><br/>The follow up adventure was about the ball. They had to get tickets, get a suitably impressive costume and then be the centre of attention while there while avoiding faux pas. A fight would have been, well, a non-sequitur. One PC got so many tickets they made a dress from them so showing to all how easily they had acquired the right to attend.<br/><br/>I lie actually. There was one fight.

We came in contact with them, and had connections to some fishermen along the coast. And one of our mages had a teleportation spell. So we tilted the magic a bit, and made our spell into a specific fish-teleportation-spell. That made it possible for us to transport fresh fish into the mountains, and sell it to the dwarves ...<br/>- and one of us being a hero, and a master-cook, made it possible for us to get the dwarves to take to the fish and secure a commercial success!<br/><br/>We actually had more joy doing fish-teleportation, than to meet and fight the big dragon ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332715/#Comment_332715" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T09:27:12+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:27AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a thing I did as a Risus one-shot called simply Magic Shop, which I described as a cross between Slayers (the fantasy comedy anime) and Are You Being Served?

My favorite bit was when they were interviewing possible new employees and one of them asked the necromancer Calabraxas the Mad what his future goals were.<br/><br/>Now there's a cult hit PC game (Recettear) with the same general concept, and a very obscure Japanese tabletop RPG (Magical Avenue, from the guys who publish Witch Quest).

We came up with a world described like this: "You know how western media imagines the east and always gets it wrong? What if this world is like some high-budget anime studio decided to make a show based in medieval europe, but they've only ever seen other anime set in medieval europe."<br/><br/>So, the ruler of the land was the Mayor, and there were dragons made of swords and dudes running around with giant axes and stuff like that. It hung together, but was pretty wild. Fun game.<br/><br/>[nerd out] For a look at a fantasy world that actually seems to have some thought put into it's economics, check out Steven Brust's Drageara stuff. It's not like he comes out and explains everything at once (though there's a lot of details about how banking works in Orca), but if you read a bunch of the Vlad Taltos novels, he tosses off enough little details that you get the sense that how the society works is actually pretty reasonable, given that everyone lives for 2000+ years and can do magic. For example, he tosses out that how war has been conducted has cycled with how powerful magic is at any given time - at first, nobody knew what they were doing, so magic didn't really matter. Then enough people knew enough magic to make it necessary to always have counter-sorcerers, and whoever had the best sorcerers would win. Then there was a time when magic didn't work, so it came down to regular troops again. Then magic came back, and now it's so powerful that everyone can do significant magic even on the individual troop level, so it kinda cancels out in the big picture, though having a dedicated sorcerer corps is necessary. And so on.
