I mean specifically something like, "We have 10 people here, 8 of them take the 'player' role and 2 of them take the 'gamemaster' role."<br/><br/>What are those games like? How are things coordinated between the GMs? How does it affect the players and their game play?

Typically the two GMs will prep together, and divide NPCs and sometimes particular scenes to hand off to one another.  What ends up happening is that one GM assumes leadership and the other takes a subordinate roll, and this dynamic reverses itself when necessary.  Sometimes one GM will take a few players aside for a scene of their own, before returning to the main deal.  I've never seen conflicts arise, although discussion between the two concerning the best way forward is common.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79265/#Comment_79265" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T08:53:27+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  8:53AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a D&amp;D campaign with co-GMs that was... interesting.<br/><br/>Both of the Gms were friends of mine and both accomplished in their own way.  I would enjoy a game GMed individually by either of them.<br/><br/>Their interplay at the table was generally great, and watching them riff of each other when interacting as NPCs was hilarious (the only time I've seen two NPCs argue with each other in a way that was entertaining to the players).<br/><br/>But one was relatively story focused (e.g. this will be a cool / dramatic story) and one was more gamist (e.g. this will be an interesting challenge).  So some aspects became frustrating.  One encounter in particular was infuriating.  Facing pursuit by a dangerous enemy we pulled out all the stops to make good our escape.  As D&amp;D is a resource intensive game, we exhausted all the resources available to us to defeat what was presented as a challenge by the gamist GM.  But just as our escape seemed assured, the story GM jumped in with, "This is boring!  The enemy catches up and attacks!"<br/><br/>This kind of bait-and-switch wasn't planned.  The GMs had a rule of not contradicting each other at the table, so as soon as the story GM made the statement, the gamist GM went with it.  But for the players, it was obviously a result of a lack of communication between the GMs or a lack of understanding of how the players were engaging with the game at that point.  We weren't bored - we were interested in addressing the challenge "by the rules".  We would have been equally interested if the challenge had been a more dramatic one.  But the mid-scene reversal was problematic, especially as it invalidated all our prior efforts as meaningless - not only a waste of game time but a waste of in-game resources with which to deal with the enemy we now had to fight.<br/><br/>To boil this down - there are a lot of good things two GMs can do that a single GM can't.  But communication, coordination, and a shared creative agenda (or clear delineations of responsibility) are fundamental to success in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79329/#Comment_79329" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T11:43:27+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 11:43AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 11:54AM by Emily_Care.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Psi Run, which Meg wrote up <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24146.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, Meg and I co-gm'd very simply and easily. The game structures the flow of plot in an efficient fashion, and farms out responsiblity for narration cleanly and with great clarity. Meg and I simply held helped one another put the screws on the players with boundaries that were spelled out by the mechanics.  It was pretty much a joy to do. <br/><br/>You may wish to look at the structure of live action games--those call for multiple gms and active player initiation of plot quite often.<br/><br/>Hope that's of use to you! <br/><br/>best,<br/>Emily<br/><br/>[sections that were off topic edited out--re: shared gm task games]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79339/#Comment_79339" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T12:26:36+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 12:26PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Also, I don't mean games which have no GM, or where the GM duties have been divided fairly among all players.</blockquote>\nI'm going to violate this bit while attempting to answer your question.<br/><br/>In Know Thyself (in its current incarnation), there's no set GM, these roles rotate around.  I won't get into the parts that I know don't answer your question.  Here's what might:  for any given scene, one person narrates framing it and another person narrates executing it, both different than the player involved.  Now, it's not "hey, let's figure out this together", and it's not truly simultaneous, but then two people can't really talk at the same time anyway so from that point of view co-GMing feels like a constant hand-off of GMing authority back &amp; forth (in a similar manner to players handing off spotlight).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
