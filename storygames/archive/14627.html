Can someone tell me how that's a creatively productive challenge? It almost doesn't even sound fun. Is it just because I've never written a novel that I don't understand? If it is creatively productive, does it suggest a similar game design challenge? How so?<br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332953/#Comment_332953" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T08:06:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  8:06AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's this ...<br/><br/>One of the things I don't like about writing and do like about role-playing is that when writing a story or novel I pretty much know how it's going to end. Frex, I wrote a kind of Philip Dickish what-is-going-on novel on my youth and it definitely wasn't as fun as reading a book by Philip Dick because I knew what the underlying reality was.<br/><br/><br/>Reminds me of AW's "Leave yourself something to wonder about"; Play Unsafe's "Introduce Mysteries"; and Inspectres.<br/><br/>So it does sound fun to me ... and therefore creatively productive, because it's easier to do anything when you're having fun ...<br/><br/>But it doesn't sound like it will produce great literature to me. I'd like to think every sentence in a great work points to the same thing...<br/><br/><br/>And some sort of game design challenge where two people collaborate and deliberately keep each other in the dark about the guts of their portion? Doesn't sound like it would make a good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332955/#Comment_332955" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T08:17:40+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  8:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2011 8:18AM by Graham.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, could you write a game based around a monster, leaving the monster unspecified until I tell you?<br/><br/>That's probably too easy.

In Newton's case, it's "can it fly? is it big? is it small? does it have a distinctive smell, or pattern of behavior?" Since all he's receiving is a picture, he can then justify all or almost all of the decisions that he makes in the context of the picture, and then go back to make the necessary adjustments.<br/><br/>I would say that the equivalent isn't so much "make a game where I give you the setting and you justify it afterwards" so much as "make a game where I give you a picture of the president and you justify it afterwards." I think the visual-to-linguistic element is important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332962/#Comment_332962" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T09:27:34+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  9:27AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2011 9:28AM by Destriarch.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I must admit I don't really like the idea either. It makes much more sense to have the monster first and write the novel around it, otherwise it risks being... well...<br/><br/>Ok, anyone seen 'Twelve Monkeys'? They send a guy back in time to try and find some criminal genius who's supposedly going to release a killer virus and nearly destroy humanity? They go all the way through the movie and right at the end you find out that they've been chasing an animal protest group all this time that has nothing to do with the plague or whatever it was, and in the last ten minutes of the movie the protagonist has to dash off to some miscellaneous airport to try and arrest the real culprit, a character we have never seen before and as a result don't care a damn about. It was just so... argh! Lame!<br/><br/>I'd worry about it turning out like that. Of course in the novel writing example you have more leeway since you could go back and rewrite large parts of the novel, but I still worry you'd end up with a major disconnect between monster and story that would take the impact out of both.<br/><br/>Still, you never know, it could be good.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332984/#Comment_332984" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T13:25:19+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  1:25PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, y'know when you're running D&amp;D, and you know there's a monster in Room 21, or wherever, and instead of knowing exactly which monster it is, you've got a Random Monster Table? And you didn't bother to read that Random Monster Table, or the Monster Manual it references?<br/><br/>That's essentially what Newton's done here. There's a monster, and he's going to roll on a random chart at some point and that's what he gets. Only his random chart is China Mieville. And he's writing a novel, which is narratively linear (one page follows another), instead of a dungeon, which isn't; and isn't improvised, like running a game is. If Newton's the kind of guy who responds well to those sorts of challenges, this will probably make the book stronger. And he is using one of the better Random Monster Tables out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333026/#Comment_333026" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T03:09:35+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  3:09AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Only his random chart is China Mieville.</blockquote>\nThis should be on a t-shirt or something.<br/><br/>Or maybe a hire-out service or toll-free hotline, like They Might be Giant's old Dial-a-Song.
