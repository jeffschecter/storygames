It seems to me like the feeling I think I would have if I served with them in real-life battle--although, having never fought in RL, I may be off-base there.<br/><br/>I'm really happy to see those I played with again and we reminisce about the battles we shared.  And it seems like a trick of the brain gives all the weight of something that happened to something that never really occurred.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that we don't even have to be on the same side of the conflict in the game.  I felt it when Jenskot and Terry showed up at Camp Nerdly this weekend, and Jenskot and I were bitter enemies in the Dictionary of Mu game we played at Dreamation, yet we embraced like war buddies.<br/><br/>And Sunday, I exchanged quips with Epidiah with whom I had risked my life to save my lady-love from zombies the night before.  I'm sure we'll have the old times to talk about when next I see him.<br/><br/>So, does anyone else get this, or should I check the yellow-pages for a therapist?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68368/#Comment_68368" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T17:30:34+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  5:30PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think your insane Shane.

Sharing a really good, really intense game is a surefire way to achieve a sense of closeness and camaraderie. On the flip side, I've found that lagging, frustrating campaigns with dysfunctional group dynamics can turn me against someone I was on otherwise good terms with. There are people I genuinely like who I would never, ever game with again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68375/#Comment_68375" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T18:47:47+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  6:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2007 7:55PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've definitely experienced this.

Even if we've never been in mortal danger we basically all bear the scars from living life on this world.  I go through my own days wondering why it is so rare that people "get real" with each other.  Even at a recent memorial service in my family, (with drinks after), people were so guarded and superficial.  In some of the better and more intense roleplaying sessions I've been in, people touch something real in themselves and each other, whether a highly idealized facet of themselves, or a Jungian Shadow.  All while pretending to be someone else in a fantastical otherworld.<br/><br/>Sometimes it seems like everyone plays pretend almost 24/7, and it's only in a group within a formally constrained social or spiritual construct that people feel free to "get real".  I've only experienced this in rare moments with my very best friends, in substance abuse support groups (there to support a relative), a couple times in formative religious ritual, and, ironically, in role-playing.  There are grades of intensity and I don't get or want that kind of intense experience from role-playing any more than one in ten sessions, but it's cool when it happens and it's<i> part </i>of what's drawn me back to role-playing for more than twenty-five years.<br/><br/>If I (The Damsel Messiah) see you (The One True Khan), jenskot (The Primite Prince), or Terry (Oghma the Runist) at Dreamation next year, I'm sure I'll feel a kind of bond.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68397/#Comment_68397" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T01:53:53+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  1:53AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You remind me of something else, Matthew.  Judd (Hi Judd!) has got mad GMing skillz and I like him for that as well as other reasons, but his life wasn't on the line when we played Mu at Dreamation, while ours were.  So this is something I don't feel as much for the GM, which is funny to me because so much of the game is obviously on his shoulders--but he wasn't slogging through it with the rest of us mortals, was he?  I hope that doesn't offend you Judd, because you are the man--sometime we'll have to play on the same side of the table and <i>then </i>I'll have your back.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about this to me is the way that my conscious mind is playing a trick on a more primitive part of my mind--the lizard-brain part that can't tell this is make-believe.  The part that gets scared when I watch a scary movie even though I know that the Moth-man isn't standing outside my house.  The trick is that I can almost believe that these are the guys who would stand with me while God himself throws everything he can against me.<br/><br/>Man, I love gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
