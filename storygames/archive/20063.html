Depending on your feedback, I'll write it either down just for "personal use" or for a broader target group.<br/><br/>Essentially, it's about playing each scene in 5 stages:<br/>1. <b>Nurture Setting (Producer perspective)</b><br/>You add details, introduce new NPCs, turn a detail into a plot etc. <br/>2. <b>Set Scene (Screenwriter perspective)</b><br/>Set Plot (either a <i>Path, Twist or Mystery</i>), People, Place.<br/>Formulate <i>Two Questions</i>.<br/>Question 1 is usually about <i>what</i> should happen (i.e. will A will be to convince B to sign the contract?)<br/>Question 2 is usually about <i>some quality</i> affected (i.e. will A and B still be best friends after the negotiation? How would their relationship change?)<br/>3. <b>Resolve Scene (Director perspective)</b><br/>Like in all steps, there are various <i>Techniques</i> available, here to resolve the two questions.<br/>4. <b>Perform Scene (Actor perspective)</b><br/>This is <b><i>actually the only part of the scene taking place "in character"</i></b>.<br/>Usually the rest is plotted at the table, this is performed at the couch or an open space.<br/>5. <b>Reflect Scene (Editor perspective)</b><br/>Wrap-up scene and prepare for next.<br/><br/>This is a generic framework to be supplemented with <i>real games</i> and possibly <i>specific playsets</i>, too.<br/><br/>Again, please let me kow.

I'm worried that it can become Play Before Play, meaning that it can feel useless to play through something if they know too much about what will happen. I had Play Before Play occur in some collaborative storytelling games, where the group discussed too much of what was going to happen so playing out the scenes were mostly about adding emotions to what we already knew. Take note of this during playtest.<br/><br/>I like point five, and would be interested to play with that in more games. Basically to sometimes stop and ask where we're heading. I actually did that 2-4 times when I was a traditional game master years ago (but I didn't realize it at the time). I did some recap of what had happened, I pointed out some things I felt the players hadn't taken into account, and I asked them how they planned to go on. It gave me the opportunity to adapt to their plans, both because I knew where they were going so I could come up with consequences of their actions, or create new situations to add more to the pot, but also because I came to understand how they thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443515/#Comment_443515" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-01T19:06:57+00:00" title="March  1, 2015  7:06PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2015 7:12PM by 2097.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a quick yes/no, I'd say this is not for me.<br/><br/>By the way, BeePeeGee, what's your take on DramaSystem?

I've played Hillfolk for the first time this week-end. There are some similarities concerning the narrative permission and the scene declaration flow. Still, it was not an inspiration source.<br/><br/>My main inspiration sources were:<br/><i>Microscope, Mythic GM Emulator, Play with Intent</i> along witha a ton of other Indie RPGs and Jeepform/Freeform etc games.<br/>Microcsope inspired me to build scenes in a structured way. Mythic GM Emulator inspired step 1 (Nurture Setting). Play with Intent is the only framework that I've found that has also <i>two distinct game spaces</i>:<br/>- Table space for thinking<br/>- Open space for acting<br/><br/>Rickard:<br/>I don't have problems with "Play before Play".<br/>So, I have very good experience in splitting the two tasks: <br/>A. (step 5,1,2,3) setting/resolving the scene<br/>B. (step 4) actually in-character acting (roleplaying)<br/>Usually, the step 4 (perform scene) takes ca. 2/3 of the time (depending on if new NPCs/plots are introduced) and there is a smooth game flow (you don't have to write-out every detail on paper, just optional).<br/>Playing like this (like in "Play with Intent") has imo the following advantage:<br/>Once you've set the scene and have determined the end result of the scene, you can really focus on the fun of peforming the roleplaying in-character. The structure is there, you just add life &amp; emotions to it.<br/><br/>The step 5 (reflect scene) is really about reflecting what you haved <i>enjoyed</i> in the scene and what would be <i>the most coolest/fun</i> things to see in the next scene/future. This ensures that the game focuses on the most fun stuff for everyone, not some boring railroading-plot I had in mind.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443545/#Comment_443545" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T08:44:26+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  8:44AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Play with Intent is the only framework that I've found that has also <i>two distinct game spaces</i>:<br/>- Table space for thinking<br/>- Open space for acting</blockquote>\nThat's exactly what made me think of Hillfolk.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443546/#Comment_443546" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T08:46:48+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  8:46AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it the Larp-Variant?

I tried it by chance and found out that it works tremendously well.<br/><br/>You are also right, the 5 steps encourage a clear distinction of planning (step 5,1,2,3) and performing the scene (step 4). This - in my experience - gives a chance to fully embrace and focus on either task.<br/><br/>The rules are just a "bag of tricks" to facilitate and encourage telling &amp; playing the story. Each technique will have a card explaining how it can be used, I'm adding these over time.<br/><br/>I've posted a (simulated) "Actual Play" here for better understanding.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
