The characters are being created on the<br/>\nfly and the bulk of the narrative is coming from the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nEpisode 1<br/>\nhttp://bit.ly/shMuBg<br/>\n<br/>\nEpisode 3 (current)<br/>\nhttp://bit.ly/rxBQRi<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogle+ page<br/>\nhttp://bit.ly/vjd3sR<br/>\n<br/>\nRob                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350432/#Comment_350432" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T06:28:43+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  6:28AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Invoking/tagging/compelling is all done in the Comments on the right-hand side of the document.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part of running this game is checking in and finding someone has written something awesome, perhaps taking things in an unexpected direction. It's kind of addictive, I use a add-on for Google Chrome so I know if there have been any changes to the document, and find myself checking up on things several times a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most challenging part of running a game like this is actually getting it off the ground and finding some interested players. Previously I've found things just get bogged down in discussions before you have even started, so for this I tried the "Just dive right in and see what happens" approach and it seems to be working out so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
