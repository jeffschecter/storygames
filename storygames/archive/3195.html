By that I mean I love it when the designer and publisher (who may be the same person) have gone to great lengths to make the game look as good as possible, and be as easy and interesting to read as possible.<br/><br/>I was talking to a friend (Magnus Jakobsson, the designer of "Until we sink") on a park bench yesterday. I was talking about how I've been so irritated lately, mostly due to the weather. He asked me what I would get irritated about. I said that the thing that pissed me off the most these days - what I get actively angry about - is when people don't make their games live up to their potential. When they don't playtest their own games; when they don't proofread their text; when there hasn't been an editor involved at any point in the process. When all they focus on is their central ideas - be it mechanical balance or interesting techniques - but fail to make those ideas <i>accessible and attractive.</i><br/><br/>Then I went down to the local gaming store to use a gift voucher I got for my birthday, thinking "now I can pick up something that I normally wouldn't shell out money for - something <i>expensive</i>". I first looked at the Swedish game Noir, which has an <i>excellent</i> GM section (R-maps and Bangs, all in Swedish), but realized I'd never use any other part of the book. <br/><br/>Then I picked up Burning Empires, and I never put it back. I read the intro and the World Burner on the train home and sent an SMS to another friend about how cool the game was.<br/><br/>Why? Because it <i>tells you what the game is about</i>. It tells you what the rules are, how to use them, what their effects are. It tells you everything in order, when you need it. It does so in an easy, structured fashion. It has a little flavor text, and only just enough setting material. <br/><br/>You can tell that <i>someone's been thinking about how to do this right</i>. Someone's been <i>working hard</i>. Many people have been polishing this text and the rules in different ways. This is <i>not</i> a rush job for Gencon; this is <i>not</i> something the author and his friends played four times before publication.<br/><br/><b>This is what I want my games to be like.</b> Burning Empires sets a standard for me to follow when it comes to rules presentation. It stands in sharp contrast to a <i>lot</i> of games I've bought and played lately. It is, in fact, in a whole different league.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72815/#Comment_72815" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T04:19:55+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  4:19AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.

Which version are you talking about? <br/><br/>The Dust Devils released at GenCon 2002 remained unchanged for nearly five years. I revised it because I wanted to do more and because I'd grown as a designer, not because it was unplayable or untested. <br/><br/>If you want to use Dust Devils as the measuring stick to compare and criticize short memories, that's fine. Please represent it accurately in doing so. Are you saying it was not playtested? Not playtested enough? Also, are you discussing the very, very original short Dust Devils PDF that existed prior to its publicaton at GenCon 2002, or the publication released at GenCon 2002 (and the PDF shortly after)?<br/><br/>I can't speak to Fastlane.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72890/#Comment_72890" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T10:46:25+00:00" title="May 31, 2007 10:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Let's just say that BE is an example of best practices, and that everyone should be inspired by it to try to produce something as close to that as possible.<br/><br/>No?<br/></blockquote>\nI'd say that until we sink, which I've played twice in the past week, is a better model than burning empire, which I own two copies of and would like to try but may never play. <br/><br/>Both are highly focused games in terms of they do one thing, but the former is basically 3 pages long, easy to understand &amp; play within 5 minutes of downloading, is free, and can be played in 45 min to an hour. BE is admirable but is harder to get into. If it were 600 pages containing 10 or 20 minigames in a common sf universe then the length wouldn't seem as big of a deal.<br/><br/>or perhaps I should say that the two games are nice extremes on a continuum of ways to design/present games but that I prefer the UWS approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72906/#Comment_72906" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T11:52:58+00:00" title="May 31, 2007 11:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are sevearl things going on with new games. First are the half baked ideas, trying to gain a foot hold in the market place of ideas. And second there are the games trying to gain a loyal following and maybe make a little money.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the ease of PDF and POD half baked ideas can get to the market place. As little as ten years ago this was not the case. Half baked ideas lived in magazine articles and as house or convention games. The cost of entering the game selling field was very high. I remember - I was stumped by it. We've encouraged half baked games to go to press in recent years which has meant a lot of undercooked ideas have made it out of the kitchen to soon. Like premature babies they finish their development out of the womb. But to do that they have to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames that are trying to gain a larger following have to be better - prettier - etc. in order to survive. Competition for people's attention is high. There are a lot of skills that most people don't have that they need to compete. Game design and play testing are just the start. Graphic design, editing, production, at least some knowledge of accounting, marketing and sales have to be learned. Without them there is only so far a business can go before some flashier, better capitalized animal comes along and takes their audience away (there goes the food/cash). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to be discouraging. I personally like what I've learned. I can't think of what else I would have done with my life that would have been better. The self knowledge alone has made it worthwhile. I now make something that is pretty good looking - the frustration is trying to figure out how to bring it to a bigger audience with the limited resources I have. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is worth while to "do it right". even if it means delays to market. I hope. I've delayed until I knew I could sustain effort and quality. Now the work really picks up.

Are games released today any less playtested than the first Dust Devils or the first Fastlane?</blockquote>\n<b>Fastlane</b> was conceived in August '03, and published in April '04, a gestation time of 9 months.  The third trimester was almost entirely layout and publication.  During that time, the following playtests were done:<br/><br/>1.  A single player created a character.  This never went anywhere, but was still a good dry-run of character creation.<br/>2.  There was did a single-session playtest in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a>, an IRC channel.  This became fodder for the example of play<br/>3.  There was a 2-3 session playtest in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a>, with some overlap with the group in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/>4.  There was a 7-8 session playtest in real life, with zero overlap with the group in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> other than me (the GM)<br/>5.  I had another friend of mine, whose experience with rpgs was nil, read the <b>Fastlane</b> text over several times during the editing and revising process.  I edited the text until she was able to understand it.  Also there were several dry-mechanic runs with the people in groups 2-4 outside of the sessions proper.<br/><br/>Appendix:  A lot of the game was designed <i>in public</i>, so there was an audience reading and responding to a lot of the posts.  I miss the Indie RPG Design forum for that very reason; I can't design future games on the Forge the way I was able to do <b>Fastlane</b>, and <b>Fastlane</b> came out very well.<br/><br/>Anyway.  I'm sure there are quite a few games that were designed as quickly as <b>Fastlane</b> was, maybe even some quicker.  But speed is not the only indicator of quality, and I don't know how many games designed on that timescale were <i>playtested</i> as much as <b>Fastlane</b> was, with the variety that any game needs (i.e. with multiple distinct, discrete groups).<br/><br/>Truthfully, <b>Fastlane</b> almost fails my standards as they exist today, as it was not playtested in at least one group that did not include the designer (and back then I tried, but couldn't find anyone willing and gave in to my impatience).  But it is a good game, and one that communicates itself well.<br/><br/>And after this past GenCon, there are quite a few games out there that fail to meet the standards of <b>Fastlane</b>'s first edition (which aren't that high).  After bringing my stash from GenCon 2006 home and reading through them, I have <i>lost my faith</i> in the indie community to bring rigorously designed and written games to the Forge booth.  Before this year, I had faith that the game I sat down to play a demo of would be the game that I purchased.  Now I'll be checking books much more closely.  Maybe that's only a tragedy to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72936/#Comment_72936" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T13:46:58+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  1:46PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite>Maybe that's only a tragedy to me.</blockquote>\nWell, it's an <i>opportunity</i> to Matt S and Paul. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72950/#Comment_72950" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T14:19:29+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  2:19PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any time someone starts bubbling "NAME NAMES" please point them at this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73054/#Comment_73054" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T06:35:57+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  6:35AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2007 6:37AM by Thor_O.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you very much Matthijs. It's very much appreciated.<br/><br/>If you're interested in the design process for Burning Empires, I wrote a series of <a href="http://urdwell.blogspot.com/2006/07/burning-empires-from-inception-to.html" rel="nofollow">five articles</a> about how we did it. I'm not sure how much of it would translate to another project, but you might find it interesting.<br/><br/>I think the important thing to take out of it is to come up with a plan for your project. Even if it's not a project intended for publication in book format or for sale, creating a plan at the outset will help you get it done the way you want it to be done.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73069/#Comment_73069" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T07:06:02+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  7:06AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtesting, yes.<br/><br/>Art, go roll a donut.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73167/#Comment_73167" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T11:12:23+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 11:12AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Any time someone starts bubbling "NAME NAMES" please point them at this thread.</blockquote>\nBen, I have no idea what this means.
