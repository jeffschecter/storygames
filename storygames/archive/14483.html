When scene framing is done wrong, it's railroading. What is the right or wrong way to frame scenes will depend on the game and the social contract, and that will be different from one game to another and from one group of players to another, so I won't go there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in general, How can you railroad your players from scene framing? For example:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Describing the scene in such fashion that not only there's just one way for the players to get through, but also describing elements that make any other option unthinkable.<br/>\n-Frame the scene in a point of time where PCs can't prepare for it, or worse, make all their preparations useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere should be plenty of ways to railroad from scene framing, but this two are the ones that come at the top of my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329688/#Comment_329688" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:44:50+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:44PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally feel like railroading means the players are going to hit the GM's mark(s) at some point, and that those marks have to do with set pieces containing established setting details, participants and lines of conflict. I want the session climax to be a showdown between the players and the villain's minion, on the castle walls, starting with the revelation that your party's pathfinder has secretly been in the villain's employ the whole time! <br/><br/>No idea what the Forge-approved meaning of "scene framing" is, but how I use it is to describe the process of a player highlighting what's important in the scene. It's a tool for establishing consensus about a scene. Yes yes, there are probably guards down in the courtyard who could shoot the characters but we don't care about that right now: what's important is that the walls are narrow, you're hemmed in on both sides and goddammit, you thought that pathfinder was your friend!<br/><br/>Now on that note, I think scene-framing can be used to railroad. That's probably what the kids call "illusionism." If the GM is your sole view into the world (via framing), and that view "naturally" brings you to a particular conclusion, it might feel like you chose to hit your marks. But you'd only know it was an illusion if you rejected the frame -- if you fundamentally disagreed with the framer about what's important in a scene. That's an authority vs credibility thing. The GM might have the authority to frame the scenes, but if the players aren't buying it then it won't work and the rails become apparent.<br/><br/>Railroad without framing = Rollercoaster ride.<br/><br/>Railroad with framing = Illusionism.<br/><br/>No railroad, with framing = Improv-heavy "storygame" style play.<br/><br/>No railroad, no frame = Yeah good luck with that.

Usually it is the result of the GM has a story that he wants to tell with a predetermined ending, and so any act taken by a character in the fiction will be steered towards that ending.  It's not *inherently* a bad thing -- I've played in some amazing games that were run very tightly on rails -- but it's definitely a different sort of fun.  And it's unpleasant to think you have freedom and find out you don't.<br/><br/>I think that scene framing *can be* railroading.  For instance, if one scene ends with Joe's character considering murdering Sylvia, and I frame the next scene in the aftermath, where my character comes across Joe holding a bloody knife over Sylvia's corpse?  If Joe doesn't get to object, and I get to decide that he murdered Sylvia, he's being railroaded, because I'm taking away a pretty significant choice from his character.  If he doesn't object, or it's what he would have chosen, or he says, "oh, I have a neat idea, let's run with this," then he's agreeing to what I proposed - which is probably not railroading, unless there's a weird power dynamic going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329694/#Comment_329694" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:59:56+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think scene framing is important to establish theme, but it can be abused to diminish or overshadow player input.<br/><br/>If the game book tells me that the "GM" (or other title) is the only one who frames scenes, I take that as a clue that they are responsible for establishing theme and tone.  I ask my players to respect that, because it's hard being the one at the table tasked with that.

Occurs at both the micro level (player: "I go downstairs." gm: "Okay, downstairs you find...") and the macro level ("several days after the battle, the king's messenger arrives with a summons..."). <br/><br/>Obviously, "unnecessary" and "uninteresting" are value judgments. But it boils down to the removal/skipping of content or potential content to focus on material more suitable for the game, material thought to be more interesting (by the person doing the cutting...), etc. <br/><br/>Also - arguably, if the GM is controlling input for the sake of the tone of the game (silly, serious, etc.), that is a form of railroading.

Gold star, Mr. Corley!</blockquote>\nI thought it was pretty clear? But okay, I can go into more detail.<br/><br/>"Scene framing is railroading that doesn't break what I've agreed to" is basically the same thing as I just said - it says that they are the same thing, they are composed of the same actions, and sometimes you like it and sometimes you don't.<br/><br/>Railroading is, simply put, scene framing (or any exertion of game power) that someone doesn't like.  This is one reason why "railroading" is a problematic term that leads people in circles, because everyone sees it differently, through the lens of their own tastes.<br/><br/>It may take away a choice from your character, but <i>everything anyone says in the game</i> does that.  The issue is when it takes away a choice that you really wanted to make, or doesn't give you a situation compelling enough to make up for the disappointment of losing a choice.<br/><br/>Here are some examples:<br/><br/>"You're at the doorway to the dungeon." says the GM in D&amp;D3.  The GM is able to say that in the game, by the rules.  If someone wanted to go shopping before they went to the dungeon, and they are more disappointed they didn't get to go shopping than they are excited by being at the door to the dungeon, then they will dislike this scene framing, and it will be called "railroading".  But if they're psyched to get started, they'll be fine with it.<br/><br/>"This scene takes place in my character's trailer, her boyfriend and the zombie wrangler are there." says the player whose turn it is in PTA2.  The boyfriend's player may have wanted to have a scene where he's canoodling with the cute Federal Reanimation Council liason behind the craft services trailer.  If she is more disappointed that she can't have that scene now than she is excited to have the scene that has been set, then she will dislike this scene framing, and consider it "railroading".  But if they're psyched to try this scene and maybe didn't expect it and it's a good surprise, they see some potential there?  Then they'll be fine with it.<br/><br/>"Mmm, I don't think going to gather more allies is much of a possibility." says a Runequest GM.  "The bad guys are raring to attack soon. You wouldn't make it back in time to save the orphanage."  The player proposing to go search for more allies presumably wanted to do that.  If they are more disappointed in not getting to do that than they are satisfied with the consistency and tone of the GM's world, then they will dislike this statement and consider it "railroading".  But if they like the GM's world and are encouraged and made more secure by the consistency of the world then they will be fine with it.<br/><br/>This matter-of-taste makes  discussions of techniques to avoid railroading pointless.  What's a great decision for one group is a disaster for another, based on their taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329706/#Comment_329706" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T13:18:22+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  1:18PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Scene framing" is an element of some roleplaying games, where the GM starts each segment of play by describing a situation the characters find themselves in, and then letting them loose in it.<br/><br/>"Railroading" is a disparaging term for role-playing games where there is a pre-determined course of events (the "rails") and the players' actions can only move them along those rails; the GM thwarts any attempt on the players' parts to make anything else happen, by subverting their intentions, by punishing them, by remonstrating with the players out-of-game, etc.  The fact that it's a disparaging term suggests that the players experience it as a bad thing; they feel frustrated or bored by it.<br/><br/>These two things seem orthogonal to me.  The presence or absence of "scene framing" in the rules of a game doesn't seem to have any more or less bearing on whether or not there will be "railroading" in that game, than the presence or absence of cheetos at the gaming table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329722/#Comment_329722" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T15:05:50+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  3:05PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've all fallen prey to one of the classic blunders -- The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is this: never waste your time engaging a Drive-by-Corely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329727/#Comment_329727" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T15:26:05+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  3:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 3:28PM by Marshall Burns.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene framing is an element of <i>all</i> roleplaying games. It is impossible to play an RPG without scene framing. WTF?<br/><br/>Railroading is making someone else's decisions for them. Sometimes this is direct and obvious (GM describes you doing something and rolls your dice for you even though you've made no input), but it's usually more subtle. One way is to frame scenes such that the railroadee has no decisions to make other than the one you want him to make. Another is to ensure that, no matter what "decisions" he makes, they have the same result. The most insidious is to start thinking about it like chess, setting up complex stratagems that trick or force the railroadee into playing into your hands without him ever realizing it.<br/><br/>(Oh, and the GM's not the only person who can railroad. Players do it to each other all the time. So everybody stop picking on GMs.)<br/><br/>Anyway, this argument is the whole reason for the term Force. It's still easy to conflate heavy adversity (esp. as applied through scene framing) with Force, but it's something you figure out eventually: there's a difference between making someone's decisions <i>for</i> them and requiring them to make decisions.

"scene framing" as a technique DOESN'T EXIST, as it doesn't exist a technique called "playing" that is the same in every rpg.<br/><br/>But, EVERY rpg, has one or more ways to frame scenes. The framing of a scene is something you can't do without, in a rpg (You open the door to the dungeon room.. someone HAS to tell you what you see inside!), But the rules about how that is done and who can do it are all over the place.  THESE rules are what differ from game to game.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>PTA: the player say "my next scene is at the marketplace, and...", the GM MUST frame a scene in the marketplace. But he still get to choose who is there at the beginning.<br/><br/>Ttollbabe: the player say "my next scene is at the marketplace, and..." but the GM can say "no, the city guard ambush you on the way to the marketplace" (the GM can frame the scene as he wants, but he can't "move" the trollbabe in another direction)<br/><br/>Spione: the player can say "the next scene is at the marketplace", and frame directly the scene, for ANY character.<br/><br/>Every one of these is "scene framing", but it's a DIFFERENT way to frame a scene.<br/><br/>As always, it depends on the game. Not every game is the same.<br/><br/>Said that, the only times I have seen a "railroading" way to frame a scene in a game is with "traditional" games (D&amp;D, Ars Magica, etc.) where there aren't explicit rule about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329778/#Comment_329778" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T18:24:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  6:24PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>The framing of a scene is something you can't do without, in a rpg (You open the door to the dungeon room.. someone HAS to tell you what you see inside!)</blockquote>\nThat's not framing a scene, that's describing the environment. As I understand it, it wasn't uncommon in very old-school dungeon crawls to do continuous description as players moved through the dungeon, probing with their ten-foot poles. If the "camera" never cuts you're not really framing a scene, are you?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>What definition [of Railroading] would you propose?</blockquote>\nI don't think I have a good one. Maybe something along the lines of: giving a player a perception that a choice between alternative options will have different consequences for future events in the fiction when you are unwilling to have that choice matter, either because you will only accept one particular option as a valid contribution to the fiction or by interpreting any contribution they make as leading to the same consequence. That still feels a bit self-referential to me, though. How do you know when you have "meaningfully" distinguishable options? It seems like there has to be an element of perception and expectation in the definition, but it can't be utterly subjective because you've got people like JDCorley who will bend any subjective definition to the point of unrecognizability, thus rendering the word useless for purposes of communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329794/#Comment_329794" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T19:48:35+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  7:48PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beth claims, in her preciously patient wisdom.<br/><br/>"Scene framing is putting someone in front of a grocery store.

So it's bad. Railroading = I'm not having fun here.<br/><br/>It's not scene framing that's railroading. None of those techniques are railroading. Railroading is when someone kills the options of others. And this is why railroading is bad. Railroading is not cool, not welcome and boring.<br/><br/><br/>If we've created characters, bought equipment, and sat down with the expectation to play a dungeoncrawl and the GM frames a scene outside the dungeon entrance, that's not railroading, it's getting to the good stuff.<br/>If we've created characters, bought equipment and sat down with the expectation to play around in a fantasy world a bit, and our characters are chatting each other up in the tavern and talking about going to the magic forest and the GM frames a scene outside the dungeon entrance because he wants us to go there, that's railroading.<br/><br/>Both are scene framing, but they aren't both railroading. <br/><br/>Rail-roading is when there is only one road, and you can't leave it because you're on rails. When you make choices and they don't fit with the planned sequence of events you're forcefully made to fail, ignored, denied etc. in an unfun manner. That's the definition of railroading and I see no point in arguing otherwise. It's bad. You're on the other hand arguing that railroading is "every time someone say something happens or is a certain way in a game forever". Which technically means that all roleplaying is railroading forever, which is useless.<br/><br/>"Hey, you've just violated my freedom/authority/right." aka "Hey, you've just railroaded me." aka "Hey, that was not cool, I'm not having fun here, can we renegotiate/talk/compromise..." is useful.<br/><br/>"Every time something asserts something about the ingame reality it's railroading" isn't.<br/><br/>I seriously fail to see where this argument to rehabilitate the term Railroading comes from.<br/><br/><br/>(edit) P.S.: I also think the whole "hey if you go along with it maybe you'll like it" doesn't really fit into the railroading discussion. That's creative disagreement, improvising, saying "yes, and", putting a spin on things etc. We need others to say and establish stuff that we don't like or expect (including the GM). That's also why we roll dice. Railroading is when the GM exerts the power <i>not</i> to be surprised by others' contributions, basically "either say/do this, as according to my script or you don't get to contribute", shutting down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329844/#Comment_329844" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T04:04:00+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  4:04AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought I'd throw this in:<br/>"Railroading is a pejorative term for a game in which something is accomplished." - Kenneth Hite, Dragonmeet, 2010.<br/><br/>There's a video of the panel, see <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?549823-Railroading-is-a-pejorative-term-for-a-game-in-which-something-is-accomplished" rel="nofollow">RPG.net</a> for a discussion and <a href="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/content/960-Investigative-Gaming-Seminar-at-Dragonmeet-2010" rel="nofollow">Yog-Sothoth.com</a> for the recording.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329845/#Comment_329845" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T04:08:55+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  4:08AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            lets get specific<br/><br/>As the GM say I frame a scene like this "your characters are sleeping, you awake to the sound of a goblin hoard surrounding your camp!

Railroading = I'm not having fun here.</blockquote>\nIn each of my examples there is a value judgment that is made by the player who did not make the decision/statement and that, NOT the action of the GM/scene framer, determines if it's good or bad. What I was trying to get at is that the idea that taking away another player's choice produces good or bad outcomes NOT depending on what the initial person did, including blocking out shopping, canoodling or gathering allies, but instead on what the "receiving" player gained or lost, and not any kind of birds-eye view social contract ("You will let me make meaningful decisions") but more "fuck, wait! I wanted to talk to this other guy first!" Everything anyone says about ingame reality closes off alternatives for the other players (assuming they have the authority to say it.)  Railroading occurs when an alternative is more valued by someone else than what is left.<br/><br/>Tyler's example is another good one. If the player wanted to fight more than they wanted to trick, chase, or learn about goblins, they will be disappointed and run to the Internet to yell about how they were railroaded.  If the player was equally satisfied by fighting and tricking/chasing/learning about goblins, they will not feel railroaded at all. (Is there nobody here who thinks that there might be someone who would be more engaged by the GM's description of goblin awesomeness than by fighting? 'Cause I have met several such people, and GMs for whom I would be such a person.) <br/><br/>The attempt to classify railroading and non-railroading by what the GM does (what we would call a "railroading technique" in the original thread?) in Tyler's example is futile.

This is one reason why "railroading" is a problematic term that leads people in circles, because everyone sees it differently, through the lens of their own tastes.</blockquote>\nWhile I get and agree with the basic jist of this, I draw attention to the post above which describes three hippie games, each with their own form of scene framing.<br/><br/>A lot of the scene framing that happens in the hippie realm isn't railroading, because before the actual scene is framed (before that "announcement of what this Scene is gonna Be") there's basically a look around the table to seek approval for this frame.<br/><br/>Ex:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><b>"This scene takes place in my character's trailer, her boyfriend and the zombie wrangler are there." says the player whose turn it is in PTA2.  The boyfriend's player may have wanted to have a scene where he's canoodling with the cute Federal Reanimation Council liason behind the craft services trailer.  If she is more disappointed that she can't have that scene now than she is excited to have the scene that has been set, then she will dislike this scene framing, and consider it "railroading".  But if they're psyched to try this scene and maybe didn't expect it and it's a good surprise, they see some potential there?  Then they'll be fine with it.</b></blockquote>\nThe breakdown/point of failure in your example is this, basically treating friends as Friends:<br/><br/>It's not:<br/>PL1: This scene takes place in my character's trailer, her boyfriend and the zombie wrangler are there.<br/><br/>It's: <br/>PL1: This scene takes place in my character's trailer, her boyfriend and the zombie wrangler are there... is that okay?<br/>PL2: Uh, actually I was hoping to have a scene first where I'm canoodling with the cute Federal Reanimation Council liason behind the craft services trailer first.<br/>PL1: Okay, that works for me!<br/>PL2: Thanks!<br/>PL1: BTW, what the hell is "canoodling"?<br/><br/>Or:<br/>PL1: This scene takes place in my character's trailer, her boyfriend and the zombie wrangler are there. (looks at the other players' faces for approval)<br/>PL2: Uh, actually I was hoping to...<br/><br/>Or:<br/>PL1: This scene takes place in my character's trailer, her boyfriend and the zombie wrangler are there. (looks at the other players' faces for approval)<br/>PL2: (makes a kind of "hesitant face", sort of like the face you do when you clip your fingernails too short)<br/>PL1: ...Or did you have an idea, PL2?<br/><br/>Or on an on, With All PTA Players Everywhere Forever!<br/><br/>Your example holds weight, I can totally imagine it! ...at a convention table, where no one really knows each other. Or one of the players is a blustering sociopath who is 'in it to win it', or perhaps someone autistic who simply doesn't understand social signals.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>It may take away a choice from your character, but<i>everything anyone says in the game</i>does that.  The issue is when it takes away a choice that you really wanted to make, or doesn't give you a situation compelling enough to make up for the disappointment of losing a choice.</blockquote>\nIn most situations with the games I've seen, though, the framing of the scene from the player - OR EVEN THE GM! - basically amounts to the player leaning forward in her chair to frame a scene, look around the table for complicit approval, to either ask outright if there's a better suggestion or look at her friends' faces for agreement. If that agreement isn't there, suggestions are taken in (or the scene-framing baton is passed) and railroading is averted. <br/><br/>Even the GMs in most of the groups I roll in operate like this in GM-strong/heavy games without player scene framing mechanisms.<br/><br/>I think of this behavior as almost like a game of chess, where the scene framer is playing the piece for everyone at the table: She leans forward, moving that Bishop to that square over there, but leaving her hand on the piece: She looks around for disapproval/alternate suggestions. If none, she removes her hand, the piece is played, and the scene begins.<br/><br/>So while I think your examples of scene framing as railroading are (to use superlatives) Wrong Forever! ...\n<blockquote>This matter-of-taste makes  discussions of techniques to avoid railroading pointless.  What's a great decision for one group is a disaster for another, based on their taste.</blockquote>\n...THIS is interesting, the clause that "what is a great decision for one group is a disaster for another."<br/><br/>Again, MOST of the games I roll with play the way above, or even over time merged to such a form (everything from a long D&amp;D 3e game to With Great Power mini-campaigns). But I would be remiss if I did not add that these techniques are NOT for every group! They are for every group *I* want to be involved in, though.<br/>To point, I had a friend who basically shut a game down with feedback (we were doing 3e set in a kind of Conan setting IIRC, it was over 5-6 years ago) because he simply did not like it when I as the GM framed scenes while *looking for complicit approval*, or suggesting that the players frame scenes (It wasn't in the "PTA" sense, it was a little more than "what do you do now?" but a little less than PTA scenes. Like, "Tell me where you are, what you're doing there as Person X tries to talk to the king", stuff like that). Basically he saw it as wishy-washy, was afraid that it impugned on the sanctity of The Adventure (he thought I was working from pages of notes, but I was winging it), it was unnatural for the GM to be asking for Player approval all the time, and so on.<br/><br/>Now, cut to years later and he loves the scene framing now, does it all the time, totally a 180 from what he used to think, and so on. But say I was the New Guy in such a gaming group and insisted on scene framing to a group full of the above people, who were all having a lot of fun at the time... It WOULD have been disastrous!<br/><br/>In the end, though, for the real scene framing we talk about here (scene framing of all types), if you leave out that step of seeking approval from the other players (even as GM), then you portray a table of autistic sociopaths. I don't know any game that requires one person to dictate the scene while the others shut up, with the possible sole exception of Microscope.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329888/#Comment_329888" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T08:22:27+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:22AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 8:23AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>In the end, though, for the real scene framing we talk about here (scene framing of all types), if you leave out that step of seeking approval from the other players (even as GM), then you portray a table of autistic sociopaths</blockquote>\nNot at all - just people who want a particular thing. Let's stick with the PTA example. "The next scene will be in my trailer, blah blah blah" "No, wait, I wanted to do a different scene with my guy." "Oh, uh, okay, your guy isn't there." Now the question is, does the request to omit the boyfriend from the scene <i>improve</i> the scene requester's enjoyment or is it to their detriment? Maybe they're like, "yeah, this is a better idea" or "mm, either way is fine, so sure", but we have to take into consideration the possibility that the shift makes the scene worse or even pointless for one person while improving it for another. As you note, collaboration doesn't satisfy everyone, but not just the act of collaborating (as the guy you describe later found it distasteful), the result of collaborating itself may be unsatisfactory, or less satisfactory than someone's original thought. The scene requester in our example wouldn't give up nothing by giving in any more than the player of the boyfriend would give up nothing by giving in.  <br/><br/>Collaboration doesn't solve this problem - either the boyfriend is there or they're not, and someone may feel that one is clearly the best outcome, and that feeling, NOT the collaboration process or the rules of PTA2 or the decision of the scene requester, is determinative of whether the outcome is good or bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329896/#Comment_329896" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T08:45:30+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:45AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dont think someone feeling that the outcome could have been better if the scene went the way they preferred is indicative of railroading.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all comes back to social contract, was that breached in coming to the set up of that scene?

If you want to say that railroading is only railroading when it results in a bad outcome, that's fine, but then you give up the idea that railroading is something that can be classified strictly in terms of what the railroading player does ("techniques") - it only has that negative impact based on the collective goals/preferences/tastes of the group (or a singular player if the impact is predominantly on that player, "no, magic doesn't work like that").\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>Railroading is a useful term, as is scene framing, but it's not a simple term.

The identification of railroading "techniques" is problematic because in the most extreme of wrong circumstances, even "I say what my character says" could railroad someone.  ("I don't want to be in a lovey dovey mushy story, ughhh!!")  Furthermore, using a "railroading technique" is often a very good idea that produces cool outcomes for everyone.

In the Adventure Burner, that is what situation is, an extended conflict that will drive the campaign that cannot be easily solved and has no clear solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329917/#Comment_329917" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T09:44:23+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  9:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 9:44AM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only wish it were like boarding a train.  <br/>At least I'd know my destination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329921/#Comment_329921" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T09:55:49+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  9:55AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to join the Dogpile On Jason just because I've got what I feel is such a clever way of looking at it -<br/><br/>Railroading is a metaphor, right?

Like if I think the game is floundering and I yell "DAMMIT you are now at the DUKE'S GRAND BALL, what are you wearing?" but I was wrong and people actually were enjoying what was happening (stealing each other's boyfriends and getting in hair pulling fights with the stableboy?), even though I never planned in advance that I was going to have to (choose to) yell what I yelled, and even if the idea for going to the Duke's Grand Ball was not my idea at all, I still railroaded, right? I took away player choice and someone hated it.<br/><br/>PS Don't plenty of those "railroading techniques" in the other thread exist primarily as a response to player action, not as direct force?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329957/#Comment_329957" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T11:29:29+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 11:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Marshall">@Marshall</a>: I'm going to retcon my post and say that I "meant" edit/veto power on the social contract level, too.

JDCorley</cite>The difference is only that I say that this is still railroading (i.e. you are still forcing the game to a particular place and eliminating choices to do other things), but I don't see it as bad in any way.</blockquote>\nWell, as I said, I'm pretty certain that the term railroading has always been assumed to mean precisely the bad instances. So frankly, I find it confusing when people say "it's railroading...but it's not bad". Or to put it differently, I have no idea why you're saying that's railroading, since it's not bad, hence it's not railroading. Argh! Tautologies. \n<blockquote> If you want to say that railroading is only railroading when it results in a bad outcome</blockquote>\nSo, yep, that's very much what I'm saying. That's what railroading always meant to me. :shrug:\n<blockquote>that's fine, but then you give up the idea that railroading is something that can be classified strictly in terms of what the railroading player does ("techniques") - it only has that negative impact based on the collective goals/preferences/tastes of the group (or a singular player if the impact is predominantly on that player, "no, magic doesn't work like that").</blockquote>\nThat's a good point. But I understood Graham's thread more in the sense that we were to assume that he already was railroading (ie. he was out with the intent to block his players in a bad way, conscious or otherwise), and we were supplying practical manifestations of that, not the other way around (that the railroad would spontaneously emerge from the techniques themselves).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>Gregor,<br/>For that matter, Graham's thread is predicated on the understanding that he is looking for the most absurd, laugh-out-loud cruelty we can muster in the form of railroading. He's actually interjected a couple of times with "Aw, you guys are so honestly and earnestly answering my question! But I was really looking for your nastiest ideas." (to paraphrase)</blockquote>\nYes, yep!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329961/#Comment_329961" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T11:47:24+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 11:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, railroading isn't on the following scale:<br/><br/>Railroading &lt;-------------------------------------&gt;

Meaningful choices is the tricky part though, I think there's a hidden caveat that what each group finds meaningful is going to be different.   Like in one group where we are dungeon crawling it's not railroading to get the characters aimed at and heading towards a dungeon rather than freely wandering about and interacting with merchants and nobles and whoever else is in the city, there may be some force to it but it's not railroading if we're all fine with it.  If it gets to combat though and you start disallowing reasonable options so you can force a certain outcome, then we are firmly in railroad territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329982/#Comment_329982" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T12:39:42+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 12:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think embedding "it's bad!" in the definition of railroad is misguided, because that then requires a different term that means "exactly like railroading in every way, except that it's possible to like it". In the wider world railroads don't have negative connotations. Plenty of people enjoy model railroads. Some people want to "win the future" by building high speed rail projects.<br/><br/>Do people think the GM's turn in Mouse Guard is railroad-y? I do, and I also think it's a lot of fun (I often think of the GM's turn as railroad-y and the Players' turn as sandbox-y). The choices the players make during the GM's turn aren't <i>completely</i> constrained, but the sequence of events that the players experience is almost completely out of their hands. It allows the GM to craft a specific experience for the players. It wouldn't be right for every game, but it's fun in Mouse Guard. I had a few lackluster sessions of Mouse Guard because the GM was so afraid of "railroading" that he wasn't willing to push the events of the GM's turn and make it an adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329985/#Comment_329985" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T12:51:53+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 12:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>Do people think the GM's turn in Mouse Guard is railroad-y?

In a recent thread I had someone ask me to define "history". I've seen people argue over the definition of the word "he" and "is". <br><br>When I look up most words in online dictionaries, I'm often presented with multiple definitions and variations. Which is totally cool, usually context helps you pick the right definition. But the vagueness inherit in a lot of language can be used as a tactic. Usually these arguments are taken to extremes to serve some sort of agenda or political view point. It often doesn't actually have to do with defining what a word means. Context and intent are important.<br/><br/>What something is and what something feels like can be completely 2 different things. That doesn't make the definition of what something is illegitimate. <br/><br/>I'm a huge Robin Laws fan, but most of his attempts to show that railroading has so many meanings it is meaningless rings false to me. Many of his given definitions all have the same causes and stem from the same thing so they aren't actually, in my opinion, as varied as they seem at first. And I'm also a huge Ken Hite fan, but "railroading is a pejorative term for a game in which something is accomplished" sounds like politics to me.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330025/#Comment_330025" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T14:20:57+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  2:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like disagreeing with JD.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330026/#Comment_330026" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T14:30:51+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  2:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have two definitions for railroading: (1) when the GM limits your choices (perhaps down to zero, perhaps not); (2) when the GM limits your choices in a way that isn't okay (usually by a social contract definition of "okay").  I think we've pretty much proven that no one who uses either definition is just going to cede it to the other camp.  What I'd rather do is just distinguish the two from each other.  "Good Railroading" and "Bad Railroading" has worked surprisingly well for me.<br/><br/>Scene Framing is one of many techniques that tends to fall under "Good Railroading".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330028/#Comment_330028" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T14:38:46+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  2:38PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>I dont see how it matters whether the GM thinks he's railroading or not.  If the group are against it and see it as a breach of the social contract on how they agreed to play the game then it's railroading.   If the group is ok with it even if they dont really like it but are willing to put up with it because the GM is taking them to "Funky Town" then it's an acceptable use of force.   The term only makes sense in terms of the whole group in action through play.</blockquote>\nWell, it matters insofar as identifying "railroading techniques" was the premise of the other thread, which this view (which I more or less agree with) pretty much makes moot.  If we're all agreeing that the same technique can be used to do something bad (which you and Teatine want to call "railroading") or something good (which you want to call "acceptable use of force") depending on the group/situation/moment, then we really haven't successfully classified that technique.<br/><br/>To reverse what I just said, since you and Teatine are determined for "railroad" to always be perjorative, then a "railroading technique" would always be bad, and a view that says sometimes the very same technique used in the very same way, just for a different group, or in a different situation, can be an "acceptable use of force" would contradict this.<br/><br/>My own view of railroading, which is anything that removes player choice from the game via the use of rules-granted authority, does not require that the experience always be bad, and so for me, a railroading technique that is also an "acceptable use of force" is perfectly natural and railroading can often be a good thing, and is sometimes the best thing to do. But if people are determined that it always be bad, that's fine too, it's a free country.<br/><br/>Ninja Edit for David: Yep, exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330031/#Comment_330031" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T14:48:28+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  2:48PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I think that's totally fair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14483/scene-framing-railroading" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14483/scene-framing-railroading" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14483/scene-framing-railroading/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14483%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14483%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
