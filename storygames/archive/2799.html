It was a weird bit of a game that I bought back in highschool for the setting.  Demobilized and barely sane super-soldiers adventuring in Cyberpunk as reinvisioned after a sitdown between NWA, Public Enemy and Noam Chomsky.  Yeah, it was as wacky as it sounds.<br/>I have overcome my book-fetishism and gone through purges of my library twice since I picked it up.  I always kept it, knowing it would be useful later.  On the way back from the Nerdly Beach Party, a discussion with Ryan Macklin reminded me of the game and I pulled it out of the garage.  I read it through again, and I found a gem.  It wasn't the unwieldy mechanics nor the over-the-top setting.  It was their campaign design rules.  What do you want to change about the world?  Easily extracted from the rest of a game showing it's age, it's worth salvaging.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63553/#Comment_63553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T14:48:04+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  2:48PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Underground</i>!

The parameters each have a complete description in the book, but they are pretty self-explanitory.<br/><br/><code>An increase in:  Also Increases:   But reduces:<br/>Wealth              Safety                Government Purity<br/>Safety               Necessities         Quality of Life<br/>Gov't Purity       Take home pay    Safety<br/>Education          Wealth                Take Home pay<br/>Necessities        Quality of Life     Wealth<br/>Take Home pay  Education           Necessities<br/>Quality of Life    Gov't Purity        Education</code><br/><br/>20 Reward Points can increase or decrease one Parameter by one point, 60 points will change a parameter without changing the others.  The group decides at the beginning of play what changes would need to take place for their goals to be met.  So, as an example, ridding a neighborhood of it's gang problem would require an increase of Safety by 2 (cleaning up the streets), Quality of Life by 1 and Wealth by 1 (reducing the appeal of the gang to youth) and an increase of Gov't Purity by 1 (driving out the crooked cops that let the gang do business) with no reduction in other values.<br/><br/>So, if we were to strap on basic character creation and a conflict resolution system, we would have IMHO a decent long-form game.  Figure 1 reward point per sucessful conflict, and 10 for completing a story arc and we're off to the races.  Upping the reward points would speed the game.<br/><br/>So, to complete the salvage game, where should we salvage dice mechanics and characters from?  For the purposes of this exercise, 90's games are a plus and wacky is another plus.  Also, what setting should it be plugged into?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63622/#Comment_63622" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T07:45:24+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  7:45AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That chart is brilliant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63625/#Comment_63625" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T07:52:32+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  7:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a bunch of Underground stuff.
