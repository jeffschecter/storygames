I spoke of something I called the rumour system (or there abouts) and promised to share it with you. It has taken me a little while, but here it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rumor has it.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I looked at the RBH i fell in love with it, because here was finally the game-rules I needed to recreate that nostalgic dungeoncrawl I so dream of. I did some tweaking, and one of the things I did was to try to mechanically tie the time spent in the village into the dungeon crawl. The idea for this has long been simmering in my head, and there were two reasons why I wanted to do this<br/>\n<br/>\n1. If we are going to play a dungeon-crawl, why not just cut straight to the dungeon? Why play through the whole here is the village sequence.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I want the pre-dungeon village sequence, but I want it to have a bit more purpose than "just some roleplaying".<br/>\n<br/>\nI had remade all the classes into a set that fit my preference of setting (pseudo-european-sterotypical/old skool fantasy): Barbarian, Priest, Warrior, Mage, and Scoundrel. I restructured them a bit to get more granuality and to do something more than just changing the names of the orignals.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the bits I added to them where someting I called Domains. This is simply put a set of circumstances in which this character type excels in. In these circumstances the character gains a +2 bonus, and it is within these domains the characters can look for rumors. (the Barbarian for instance has the domain: The Wilderness.)<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich leads us to the meat of this post. The rumors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen in the village or town, prior to setting out for the dungeon, the adventurers may go looking for rumors and local legends surrounding the dungeon. You play this out, flavored by the Domain which the character has. At some point the player has to decide what the character is looking for:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A secret</b> - something concrete about the dungeon that is useful (location of secret doors or entrances, known traps ect.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tales of treasure</b> - this adds a new treasure to the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rumours and Tales</b> - a number of rumor tokens (works like awesome tokens) that when in use gives the bouns but requiers that the player adds details to the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player rolls and compares the result against the awesome token table. How to interpret the results varies a bit depending on which rumour the character is looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A Secret.</b><br/>\nThe player needs only win one token or more. The DM has to give the player a secret fact about the dungeon. this has to be true and helpfull. If there are no more secrets to uncover the DM has to tell the player before the character looks for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tales of treasure.</b><br/>\nThe value of treasure depends on the amount of tokens won. The DM needs to come up with a treasure on the fly, and create a short story for it. Alternatvily he can let the player describe this. The DM then needs to place this in the hands/room of one of the monsters. (negative tokens means that one of the treasures in the dungeon sinks in value).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rumours and Tales.</b><br/>\nThe player gets a bounch of tokens according to the table. This work like awesom tokens except the player has to describe how a detail form the dungeon aids the character or hinders his opponent. This detail only works once (the duration of the bonus) and the player has to come up with new details for every token.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there you have it. Nothing too fancy or revolutionary. But it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nK                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138347/#Comment_138347" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T16:13:29+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  4:13PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!<br><br>I did something else in adapting the rules, which might be fun to mention here.  I'll put it back into RBH terms, so that it makes sense to all.<br><br>The monster has more traits than usual, and some of the traits the Monster has come from places of power that the monster has 'tamed'.  To get an edge in the fight against the monster, the adventurers can find these places and botch up the connection the monster has.<br><br>Finding and botching up this stuff makes for little mini-quests that can be discrete unto themselves.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138377/#Comment_138377" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T22:44:57+00:00" title="April  5, 2008 10:44PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adapted ... or stolen which ever you prefer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138411/#Comment_138411" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T11:36:40+00:00" title="April  6, 2008 11:36AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff guys. <br><br>Kaare, I really like the way the dungeon is almost designed through the tales and rumours, and that the pre-dungeon tavern session now brims with purpose.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138428/#Comment_138428" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T15:42:07+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  3:42PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2008 3:42PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kaare,<br><br>I'm glad you finally posted this!<br><br>It's interesting to see the similarities and differences between your method and mine. (My Adventure Procedure for RBH can be found <a href="http://www.fudgerpg.info/guide/bin/view/Projects/RedBoxAdventure" rel="nofollow">here</a>, with the part most similar to yours <a href="http://www.fudgerpg.info/guide/bin/view/Projects/RedBoxAdventureCunning" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>It sounds like your procedure is designed to go with a premade dungeon, whereas mine is more of a procedure to make up an adventure on the fly. For instance, "reduce the value of one treasure in the dungeon" could be tricky if you hadn't thought about what treasure would be there to begin with.<br><br>When you played, how much prep had you done before playing?<br><br>Also, I really like the Domain idea. Gives each character yet another "niche" where they can excel.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>(Edited to fix links.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138429/#Comment_138429" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T15:52:09+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  3:52PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drawing the dungeon map and coming up with the various monsters is a part of the trip down nostaglia-lane I am looking for.
