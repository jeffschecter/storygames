It was semi-good-bordering-on-full-good. Some problems arose, I felt, mostly due to a lack of DM moves sheet. I should have prepared one, but basically I used the ones I could remember from the ApW book. I could really have printed that one off, but still. The lack of reminders of what I as a DM could do was troublesome, and I missed some good opportunities. My bad.<br/><br/>Character generation was excellent, with some good war stories and the foundation of the group. We had a Fighter, a Thief and a Cleric (evil). <br/><br/>I didn't have a dungeon in mind or anything, instead opting to see where the characters themselves took the action. As such, we started in the inn. You know, like all good war stories. The group was broke, and Kvast the Fighter was trying to get people to arm wrestle for pints. A guy steps up, and Kvast rolls hack &amp; slash. He gets a total of six. Shit. Anya the Thief steps in and aids Kvast by distracting the patron, pushing the roll to 7. Awesome, I get to trade harm for harm! The patron's fist slams into the table as Anya tickles him, and he instantly shouts "Cheaters!" Turns out he's a member of the Hand of Light, a rather pious church. After some sparring the guy flees, angry and shamed. <br/><br/>The group spends an inordinate long time getting out of the inn, after the barkeep asks them to sod off. This gives me time to line up the Hand of Light outside, torches aloft, ready to burn them some heretics. There's a fight, but as I was unsure how to deal with an opponent that was a group, it didn't really go that well. The players also had some issues with the fact that they rolled, and I didn't. Two of them kept waiting for my rolls in order to react. We also ended up, not only for this fight but all of them, with a lot of hack &amp; slash rolls. Maybe I should have taken some action to make them dodge and defy danger more, rather than hacking and slashing? They did take a fair bit of damage from 7 - 9 rolls.  <br/><br/>The king's guard shows up halfway through the fight, and everyone's arrested. Scene closed as the characters get knocked out and placed on horses. <br/>They come to in a prison, quickly bust their way out (bend bars lift gates, a total success), bypass a mongrel of a giant prison guard by figuring out that he fears fire (clever girl). They grasp a torch and scare him off. The group then finds the way to the locker room where they find their gear (I let them have it all back. why not?). The guard in the lockerroom's asleep, but the fighter decides to knock him out further. He rolls snake eyes, and I figure that it's time to throw some more complications into the mix. The guard's neck snaps, and he collapses into a heap on the floor. The group flees, and finds that they are no longer in the hamlet they started out in, but rather Riverland, the capital of this magical land. A quick thought from the cleric is that they should probably seek fortune elsewhere, and thus they want to hire onto a caravan as guards. Sure. This will be interesting, I think. <br/><br/>The caravan's destination is about 11 days travel through the wilderness, I decide in a triumphant guesstimation. They do have to travel through hostile territory (otherwise, why would they be guards?) and the undertake perilous journey roll fails massively. Snake eyes, again. I ask them if it's ok that I narrate something, and they agree. The caravan members have the pox, something that become apparent after three days travel. The PCs strike out into the wild, deciding that they can probably survive better if they don't, you know, die from said pox. After trucking through the wild for a day or three, spending all their food and such, they come upon a small cabin in the woods. They knock on the door, and a toothless hag opens up and invites them in. Inside they are given some stew. Anya the rogue discerns that the stew is alright for her to eat. The two others take her cue and gobble it up, only to find out that the stew contains...let's call it man herbs. The old hag sees her opportunity and in a fit of violence mounts the poor cleric (he fumbled his dodge roll, I gave him the opportunity to either take damage or let himself be...taken advantage of). The two other players watch in horror for a few minutes until they hear the cleric's ragged cry for help. They take action, and a quick fight ensues in which the fighter cleverly uses the boiling pot of stew as a missile weapon (check xp). The poor cleric, however, fails his defy danger (I interpret this as a saving throw) and is now cursed. They dispose of the hag, and prepare to leave. The cleric convenes with the dead hag, and finds out that he's been cursed and that he needs a church to clear the evil spirit from his body. But...where to go. After some heated debate (bonds fluctuate), they decide to go back to Riverland. The outstanding warrants roll fails, sadly. No warrants to play on for me <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> <br/><br/>Back in Riverland, the cleric seeks out the only church in town equipped for this kind of thing - Oh yeah, The Hand of Light. In this case it's a rather commercial church. They don't really want to treat him unless he converts to their ways, which would anger his god and general demeanor. A brilliant parley roll allows him to suss out that tracking down a lost child will convince the priest to heal him. So, off the group goes, into the sewers of Riverland. Traps and small fights ensue, but this is where my memory of the MC moves fail me. I disappoint myself a bit with the small dungeon, not picking up on opportunities to separate the group or anything. They end up in a nightmarish alchemy lab where a wizard has kidnapped several children and use their energy to sustain his nearly dead body. The group manages to rescue the child at hand, but Anya the Thief nearly dies in a rather dramatic battle sequence. The cleric also flees from the scene with the child he was sent to rescue in the middle of the fight, something they have to deal with later. <br/><br/>At this point it was getting late, so we wrapped up the session with some carouse rolls that all gave some good hooks for new adventures. That, and general drunkeness from the dwarf fighter (hello stereotypes). <br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>All in all it was a decent session. Not great, but decent. There was a decidedly great lack of direction for most of the session, but I can see that ironing itself out as the group develops adventure hooks to follow up on later down the line. My biggest concern is really how to provoke other responses than hack and slash when the fighting begins. Anyone have any good examples? <br/>Another problem I faced was how to deal with fighting when the PCs face an entire group of enemies that is too large to seamlessly pick apart into smaller bands. I'm sure that's somewhere in the rules set, but I'd welcome any pointers for that as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341567/#Comment_341567" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-04T17:07:40+00:00" title="September  4, 2011  5:07PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been trying to screw with my players in interesting ways during combat, to make them do interesting things besides slugging it out with monsters.  The monster-specific moves are a great way to do this, and you can also use all the regular DM moves during combat (separate them, signs of doom, opportunity, etc).  <br/><br/>I notice some of your hard moves took the game in a whole new direction (the caravan getting pox, for example), and that's fine, but less dramatic things might be smoother -- I used to wear myself GM'ing Apocalypse World until I realized that a hard move was just that, a metaphorical punch to the ribs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341713/#Comment_341713" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T07:35:11+00:00" title="September  6, 2011  7:35AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My sense is that DW works best if you skip most of the pre-game (so to speak) and jump straight into the group being actually in an actual dungeon in imminent danger of some kind.  This is true of Apocalypse World as well, which is why the session moves are so great (no matter if they succeed or fail, it's on now!).  It's a sandbox game, but that doesn't mean the players should have to figure out where the fun and story is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341801/#Comment_341801" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T22:50:10+00:00" title="September  6, 2011 10:50PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2011 10:52PM by Anarchangel.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you using the Red Book or the Adventurer's Guild playtest pdf? The latter has a page of rules for groups.<br/><br/>I agree with Jonathan's comment. When I ran DW at a con over the weekend, I started with the characters all sitting in a bar telling stories of fabulous wealth in exotic locations, then had them choose which one to do. The next scene was at the edge of the selected location, in this case, a blasted swamp around an ancient temple. Voila, there's the fun.<br/><br/>That said, I totally dig the travelling sandbox style you've described above, and I'll definitely do that when I run the game as a campaign, but first, I'll get the hang of it with the kind of instant action thing I described.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
