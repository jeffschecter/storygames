My X-Community College game has begun, we've had three sessions and it's going great. This new thread is because the old one is getting full and unwieldy. Here's what you need to know.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14096" rel="nofollow">The old thread.</a>  I didn't know what to name a game so that I could have super-fast-talking introductions like Glee, and still have it be hilarious like Glee's. We came up with Uncanny.<br/><br/>There are six people playing. Pathways took FOR FRICKIN EVER as a result.  Everything had to be connected to everything else. Also it's easier to build a cul-de-sac in a six-person Pathways game, which is not a good setup.  But whatever, we got it done, it can get smoothed out in game.  It's way too complicated to replicate or post. But the premise of the game is that the characters are the college-aged members of a West Coast X-men team in an approximation of the movie-verse (so that I can incorporate all kinds of nonsensical shit from the comics but I can put a new spin on it if I want, and I'm not married to continuity.)<br/><br/>I wrote a new ending step for Pathways because the characters aren't quite established heroes yet, but it reflects what brought them to Vistamar College, the "integrated" mutant-human experience that Xavier's Academy doesn't have.  <a href="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/gaming/cheatsheets/pwayssit1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Situation</a>.  Everyone more or less picked the College or Slacking Off situation.<br/><br/>We did a flashback to <a href="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/gaming/cooperflash.pdf" rel="nofollow">Afghanistan, 3 Years Ago</a> to help explain the background of one of the characters (a Feature who was kicked out of the Army on a thinly veiled Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell analogue), and introduce the game.  Feel free to use the characters and new Distinctions in your own game.  And there's a <a href="http://8tracks.com/jdcorley/afghanistan-3-years-ago" rel="nofollow">8tracks soundtrack</a> for it too.<br/><br/>I created an <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Mutant_Academy_Adventure_Generator" rel="nofollow">Adventure Generator</a> on Abulafia. It hasn't gotten a ton of use yet, because I haven't quite formed up the team yet.  And also I'd like for people to add in more entries, so come and help!<br/><br/>The theme song of the game is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WALk6njJiU" rel="nofollow">Born with Wood</a>, a mashup that combines the inclusiveness and pop-insanity of Lady Gaga with the classic sounds of the 60s-70s X-Men.<br/><br/>We spent some time in the last thread going over Features and helping me come up with those, that was really helpful. We'll do that here too as I come up with people. Actually a really Feature-heavy game helps with continuity.  This is not an episodic Smallville game, so I did some rules tinkering to help with Plot Point distribution and so on.<br/><br/>And now...drumroll please...the campaign website is up!<br/><br/><a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>Uncanny</b></a><br/><br/>Here are some of my favorite entries:<br/><br/><a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/post/7533630342/deceased-persons-of-absolutely-no-note" rel="nofollow">Deceased Persons of Absolutely No Note</a> - a player had never seen X3, and didn't know what Morlocks referred to in the X-Universe, so she needed to be brought up to speed on how the leadership of the Omegas/Morlocks in the X3 universe had all been killed when they joined up with Magneto. I started writing it in a character voice, and...turns out I really like the voice. So I made him into <a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/post/7540392484/run-on-omega-freak-poor-run-on-his-telepathy" rel="nofollow">a guy with bad clarivoyance problems</a>.<br/><br/>One of the characters has a band, Faux Pas.

How do you feel about maintaining this sort of effort for years?)</blockquote>\nFirst, thanks!!<br/><br/>Second, Smallville makes a lot of this really easy because of the lifepath character generation. I knew from the beginning that there would be a Morlock who falls in love with the physics girl, and she has an evil precognitive grandmother, and so on.  <br/><br/>There are lots of online tools to make setting up a site like this easy.  The reason I used tumblr rather than a blog or a wiki is: 1, I know I will be the only one (along with Addie's player) adding anything significant to the site so a wiki would be a waste of effort, and I wanted it to be more interrelated/connected than a more "linear" blog.  Tumblr has a lot of "grid layout" stuff.<br/><br/>So here's what I did:<br/><br/>I went to <a href="http://www.flickr.com" rel="nofollow">flickr</a> to get the NPC pictures. (If you use Chrome, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/idiemcijhbenngdhkdiipmpkafnkbkeg" rel="nofollow">DownFlickr</a> add-on is vitally important.)  I spent an afternoon or so just grabbing interesting-looking people of various ages.  Then I used the <a href="http://www.aviary.com/tools" rel="nofollow">Aviary image editor</a> free online program to put the lettering on.<br/><br/>Now, once I started doing this, I remembered something that helped a lot in my last game. I had index cards with the names of NPCs, and we'd put them in the middle of the table. This meant people would say the name of NPCs, and refer to them properly, instead of "the sheriff" or "the guy who gave us the clue".  I hoped this would be less prevalent in a more relationship-based game anyway, but what the hell, the banner ad at the top of this website I was at said Shutterfly would print out pictures for me for free.  So I used it.<br/><br/>Oh my god, when I got out the glossy <i>photograph</i> of Carol Cooper in her military uniform, the place went nuts. They love them.<br/><br/>So now, pretty much for the price of shipping, I have free photographs of all the NPCs, immediate visual aids, and everyone gets to remember the names.<br/><br/>All right, so that's why this is not as hard as it looks.  (Also note that I haven't filled in the stats for many of the NPCs, heh.)<br/><br/>And the nice thing is that with a 3-4 hour session every week, I'm only going to be introducing a few NPCs, locations or situations each week.  So what I have to do is pretty minimal.<br/><br/>I hope that I can keep it up, that's an issue, yeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339164/#Comment_339164" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T00:40:36+00:00" title="August 17, 2011 12:40AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 12:42AM by Cneph.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Oh my god, when I got out the glossy<i>photograph</i>of Carol Cooper in her military uniform, the place went nuts.

I think I figured it out. It's because the adaptation of existing characters into Smallville and the adaptation of existing comic book characters into a movie proceed (when done best) along parallel tracks.<br/><br/>First, you identify the core of the character. Just the basic concept. Comic book characters are GREAT at this.  They are iconic, broadly drawn.  The whole idea is that many writers and many creators over a long period of time will see these characters in different ways, but Superman is always Superman.<br/><br/>Example for this game: Marie-Ange Colbert, "Tarot", a tarot-card-focused mutant exchange student, a minor-at-best character who existed doing very little for several years (1990s X-comics, yeah!) before being killed for no real reason.<br/><br/>In the actual comics, she had a jumble of powers relating to psionic constructs made from the Major Arcana. But to me the core of her character was: She was French, she used Tarot cards to focus her powers, she did not make it onto an X-Team and ended up being eternally the softest-hearted one on a villainous team.<br/><br/>Second, you take that core character and you now apply it to the relationships and issues developed by the main characters.  (The movies, WHEN THEY WORK, do this with its dynamic or point-of-view characters, normally Wolverine and Rogue, but sometimes others.)<br/><br/>Example: So one of the player characters in Uncanny, <a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/post/6476107175/adelaide-hale-dont-let-me-falter-dont-let-me" rel="nofollow">Adelaide</a> was raised by her precognitive grandmother and believes her plans to be evil.  She has a huge hangup about precognitives and free will and the future.  So naturally I focused Marie-Ange's powers on her precognition and brought the grandmother in to teach her how to use them.<br/><br/>Third, now that you have situated the character within the relationships and issues developed in the game, you extrapolate from that position backwards to what they believe and how they got there.<br/><br/>Example: So why is she so focused on Tarot cards?  In the X-Universe, limitations on powers are always related to personal hangups, so I decided that Marie-Ange's precognition had uncontrollably manifested, putting her in dangerous situations and threatening her, until she connected with an older tradition that allowed her to focus.  Grateful to this tradition, she is somewhat conservative in outlook, believing that "old ways" are going to contain the answers to the problems of her life.  She's also interested in the occult and somewhat goth-y.  This is good because it will cause her conflict with the more traditional traditionalists?<br/><br/>The great thing about this third step is that Smallville requires you to do it.  You have to be able to write six things that every character believes.  <br/><br/>For NPCs, you don't necessarily have to do this before you start, but you won't find them changing until you understand why they are the way they are.<br/><br/>Result: <a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/post/6219454711/marie-ange-colbert-she-was-recruited-and" rel="nofollow">Tarot</a>, and her confrontation with Addie in last week's game that had everyone staring at  the Addie as she lost her shit at a party.   "Was eet zomething I said?" I said, in my very best high school French accent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341131/#Comment_341131" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T18:24:20+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  6:24PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New Twitter brainstorm/contest underway <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/JDCorley/status/108299276769169409" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>In my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23SmallvilleRPG&amp;Mode=like">#SmallvilleRPG</a> game, an anti-mutant pop/rock band has several songs: "Only Human", "Unevolved &amp; Proud"...they need some more.

It also helps if you don't have perfectionists who think "absolutely everything must be absolutely perfect".<br/><br/>The cul-de-sac issue became pretty extreme in a couple of cases.  With a smaller Pathways, the step that requires you to connect two things on the map OTHER than player characters tends to draw things in closely enough.  With 6 people it's possible (and it actually happened) that one or two characters that seemed pretty interesting turned out only to be connected to one player and thus things that happen with them are only really going to directly impact that character.<br/><br/>I didn't do anything in Pathways to fix this, instead what I did was I had those cul-de-sac characters take action/head in the direction that would bring them into other characters' bailiwicks.<br/><br/>For example, a PC's father is a bit of a conservative guy, and doesn't know his kid is a mutant.  So I'm going to have him join up with a "neighborhood mutant watch" group more or less of scared people, who are being misused by the Friends of Humanity to help pick their targets, which will bring him directly into conflict with the rest of the player characters.  That way connections can be drawn in play even if it wasn't a really great setup.<br/><br/>Jon, I love your suggestions (and you can see why I turned to Twitter instead of to Google, god bless you for delving into that cesspit for my silly game), but the Friends of Humanity take at least some pains to make themselves seem normal/palatable/not psychos, so some of those wouldn't work.  But "Stronger" and "Mutant Town" are really good, and I can use the rest for the more extremist groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344763/#Comment_344763" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T16:25:27+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  4:25PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I've just had a character in the game world live-tweet a Mutant Brotherhood attack.<br/><br/><a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/post/10996035192/40-oz-facelift-livetweets-the-charity-concert" rel="nofollow">Enjoy.</a><br/><br/>And of course, the "straight" <a href="http://uncannyvillerpg.tumblr.com/post/10981014824/charity-concert-target-of-mutant-brotherhood" rel="nofollow">news story.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345191/#Comment_345191" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T08:36:27+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  8:36AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2011 8:37AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone in the group wanted to learn Gumshoe, so I created a Mutant City Blues scenario in the same universe.

Smallville is a game where your capabilities are not defined in the sense of "how much can Superman lift".  Instead your capabilities are defined as "what can you accomplish when you're fighting for this, under these pressures".  They simply didn't like a system that gave equal weight to being a great planner and being a blabbermouth, but because both of those are traits that can be rolled in various situations, they felt that the system was not rewarding them for "skilled play".  In other words, they weren't feeling rewarded for outwitting the opposition because they might have just blundered through it with (hand on heart) the power of ~Friendship~.  And even if they did as much as they could to stack the systemic deck in their direction, in the end it would always be about what they felt instead of what they knew.<br/><br/>I adored, absolutely adored, the system exactly for this reason, because it really reflected what I was after in the X-canon. What are X-comics about? Why is their history so convoluted? Well, because people in these comics, in their bigger-than-life ways, are tormented by their beliefs. They switch sides because they've come to see their values in a different way. And when the chips are down, it <i>really is</i> the power of friendship (or love, or brotherhood, or loyalty) that wins the day.  I could throw them against a powerful mutant superterrorist without pulling any punches, because the conflict system was all about what the terrorist wanted, and what they wanted, and who was going to get what they wanted, not who had the best plan to nail the other side.  Nothing in X-comics makes any sense at all <i>except</i> the emotions.<br/><br/>There were some other weird things - people didn't like doing "their own thing", which the advancement system required. They felt it was artificial and stupid. (Again, I didn't, I loved it.)  But the dynamic of the group was such that people felt resentment and nervousness when people had the spotlight and used it in ways they didn't see as productive. There is a lot of that in a system where relationships are a major part of what's on your character sheet.<br/><br/>I feel Smallville helped me write better NPCs.  You literally must write six things each important NPC believes about the key values in your game.  This is so, so perfect.<br/><br/>In the end, on my end of the table it was a great success.  2 other players agreed with me, they loved it. 2 more hated it. Another was meh.  So that's 3 out of 6 that weren't psyched about it after 6 months of play.  I let them rescue the anti-mutant politicians from the Mutant Brotherhood on national TV and called it a night. I'm still up for other questions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385018/#Comment_385018" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-13T01:59:59+00:00" title="July 13, 2012  1:59AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to get a Smallville game up and running, and I'd be interested to know how, if at all, you streamline making Features.

She granted it.<br/><br/>On November 9, a message on Geraldine \u201cJer\u201d Parchman\u2019s answering machine at the Santa Monica Pier from Eric indicated that he was looking into events in Wheeler Springs, a Friendly Town approximately two hours northeast of Los Angeles. These events were connected to the apparently accidental death of Lori E. Phillips, a church official, which had taken place earlier that year.<br/><br/>On November 10, Jer tried to call him back.
