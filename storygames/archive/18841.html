From this, you got XP and gp, so you could go down in other dungeons and hack bigger monsters for bigger loot.<br/><br/>This kind of reward system has somehow rubbed itself off on everything. It seems to me like a standard solution is to throw a reward on something to make it more appealing. Now why should you do that? Why should you give a +2 bonus for a skillful attempt to roleplay a seduction? Why should you give 1 XP for following your key? Why should you get a die when someone thinks you did something good?<br/><br/>The thing is, getting XP for using the game mechanics by rolling dice is sound. It makes sense that: if you do something, you can then do some more.<br/><br/>Getting XP for following a key isn't. I didn't use any game mechanics - I just created a situation. Yet I still getting XP. That's a bribe.<br/><br/>I'm getting FATE points for using negative aspects. That's a bribe.<br/><br/>If the game wants me to do something, it should make me do it because I want to. Otherwise, I should play another game. A game shouldn't have to bribe me. A game should tell me what to do. Negative aspects should be as fun to activate as positive ones without getting negative response from the system. Keys should be followed up in new scenes with similar themes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421949/#Comment_421949" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T13:55:07+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  1:55PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2013 1:56PM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that's a bribe is activating aspects in a positive way.<br/><br/>Another kind of bribe is having different skill values.<br/><br/>What these tells us is "Use me, because I'm giving you a bigger bonus". "Use me, and here is your reward." What you get is a bribe.<br/><br/>We can talk about rewards, but rewards are nothing more than a kind of reinforcements. Reinforcements are important. They give you a feedback on what you've done. The thing is that reinforcement should be related to the task. A player that chooses a key tells the others what the player wants the session to be about. Using game mechanics by hacking monsters, then the reward should be something related to game mechanics (XP and gp). By activating a key, what should the proper reinforcement be? By playing out a seduction scene, what should the proper reinforcement be? When someone thinks you did something cool, what could the proper reinforcement be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421950/#Comment_421950" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T14:06:39+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  2:06PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Care to talk about rewards/bribes/recognition and the impact they have on the social level and ongoing play?<br/><br/>I have some not-fully-formed thoughts on that stuff, but I'm curious where you might take that concept first, Rickard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421953/#Comment_421953" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T14:10:13+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  2:10PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2013 2:16PM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I'm talking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect#Controversy" rel="nofollow">overjustification effect</a> and how bribes can (not automatically will) decrease the joy of going through with a task, I'm not talking about it as that some magical effect that automatically takes place.

Fascinating stuff and worth chewing on.<br/><br/>I'll offer a slightly different take, however, on the fanmail thingie.<br/><br/>You get fan mail by participating <b>and</b> by doing something in-fiction that the other players [notice + enjoy].<br/><br/>If you get fan mail, later, in circumstances where it might be useful, when there is a delicately balanced situation where things can swing one of two ways, you can spend your fanmail to produce a slight edge that things are more likely to go in your preferred direction.<br/><br/>Um, that seems pretty directly linked together in my mind. Your fellow players have recognized that you add great stuff, stuff they enjoy, into play. In a tight balance situation, you have resources to swing things in a direction you prefer, but that's good because your friends have already told you they think you add good stuff to play.<br/><br/>So fan mail, just a temporary tie-breaker vote that isn't entirely guaranteed, right? One that you only would receive from fellow players, who only give it optionally and voluntarily as recognition for things you did as a player to increase everyone else's fun.<br/><br/>Seems pretty directly linked at least the player level if not quite at the fiction level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421960/#Comment_421960" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T14:30:01+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  2:30PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we're talking about the fan mail in PTA, can you give me a brief overview of how it works.

Let's say it's a really great characterization. Someone else loves that, thinks it's the bees-knees, and slips you a fan mail counter.<br/><br/>Later on, there's another scene and there's a conflict that engages the card mechanics. Basically, you will receive X number of cards for your side of the conflict. Expend a fan mail counter for an extra card. Now you have the possibility of winning the conflict raise slightly.<br/><br/>That's it in a nutshell. Of course, the only reason you can do that is because someone earlier thought you did something they liked and was worth recognition.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421968/#Comment_421968" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T15:03:30+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  3:03PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2013 4:01PM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's the kind of reward mechanism I really dislike.

If you know that you're on the board of being judged by the other participants, two negative things can happen:<br/>1) You wont participate because of your worry of the other people's judgement.<br/>2) You start describing what the other people wants to hear, instead of describing what you think is fun.<br/><br/>Not to say that one person will probably end up with the less amount of fan mail as the others, so the people are giving them away out of pity instead.

Social fear (#1) is a real thing, just as other kinds of fears. Sometimes you just have to plunge ahead on that stuff. I'm not sure anything can be done about that if the fear truly locks down a person's responses. I've heard parachuting is massively exhilarating, but I hate heights. Terrible, terrible fear of them. I avoid parachuting for this reason. I'm missing out on that exhilaration. You really can't make something for absolutely everyone.<br/><br/>On the second issue, the opposite side of the coin may be that groups start to gel better, and a period when people are feeling one another out is inevitable, no matter what. That period will indeed be a period of figuring out what people like to hear, and also taking chances, but hopefully everyone is doing that at the same time, so everyone is in the same boat. I assume that's why most of these kinds of mechanics are built with rewarding the positive, but no mention is made of the negative ( You suck, don't do that again!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421975/#Comment_421975" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T16:06:02+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  4:06PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the hobby is clearly social, through and through. It's gonna be hard to avoid those moments of fear, if that's your personality type. On the other hand, hard-wiring positive reinforcement into the system gives incentive for people to come out of their shells and engage the group.

If you get another cake for eating a cake, then you can both eat the cake and keep it. If you're getting money for eating a cake, then it's a bribe.

Everyone in the game has this stat. The vast majority have a 2 in it. But the players know that this is a huge, huge level of abstraction -- they know in real life people who are great public speakers but incompetent at flirting, people who are awkward around children but great fun at parties, people who are amazingly attractive but kind of annoying when you sit next to them on a long car trip. That game explicitly does not support that kind of specialization: if you want it (and let's say for the sake of argument that you do), you have to create it yourself, so your Don Juan-a-like gets a +2 on his skillful seduction not entirely because you want to reward him for being seductive, but because you want him flirting with the heiress to be clearly <i>different</i> from him trying to convince his grandfather to loan him fifty dollars.<br/><br/>(And I'm not saying that's the only motivation, obviously, but it's definitely one of them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ThatOtherDan" title="ThatOtherDan"><img alt="ThatOtherDan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ThatOtherDan">ThatOtherDan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421986/#Comment_421986" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T18:55:53+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  6:55PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rickard?

And dealing with and handling those other situations can be part of the joy of the game.  <br/><br/>Or, in the case of aspects/keys, they may be a bribe (I have used them as such in the past).

Maybe. But I'm still not quite sure. I mean, we accept that characters have strengths and weaknesses, right? Is it really the system "luring" you? Or is it that the player has raised a flag for what they want to see and do, using the system? To me, skill ratings are reinforcements, not bribes. They say "you want your character to be good athletically? Okay, here's how we guarantee that: you have good athletic skill ratings."<br/><br/>I agree that a system <i>can</i> bribe you into certain behaviors. I don't think that's bad, personally- it's why I choose one game over another, because it's going to reinforce the playstyle I'm after. I'm very very curious where you draw the lines between the concepts of reinforcement, reward, and bribery. Are you <i>really</i> saying we should<i> never</i> give mechanical weight to a character's fictional abilities?

Right?</blockquote>\nI feel like adding an additional wrinkle to this:<br/><br/>Sometimes players make characters who are exceptionally good at a particular thing not because they want that thing, but because they think that thing will happen no matter what, and they want to get it over with quickly and cleanly.<br/><br/>Imagine a Western game in a system where a master gunslinger can end a fight before it even begins: if you think that gunfights will be inevitable AND you don't want to spend a lot of actual, real-life time playing out gunfights, you might choose to play a master gunslinger in order to <i>minimize</i> your play's focus on shooting people. In that case, it's less of a flag saying "I want everything to be about guns," and more a flag that says, "If we have to have guns, I want to make it an automatic victory for me so that we can move on to more interesting things right away." Likewise, someone who really wanted to spend a lot of time in gunfights might keep their shootin' skills in a low-to-medium range, so that the fights will last much longer and give them more to do.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is, it pays to ask a lot of questions about why a character is good at something, and to not just assume that +10 Gunplay means a player wants a steady diet of high-noon showdowns and a monomaniacal emphasis on guns. We've all misread the situation before: a high skill can sometimes mean "I don't care about this," and a low skill can sometimes mean "I want to have to deal with this all the time," and vice versa. If you're not 100% sure which is which for that person and that character and that game, then it's not a very useful flag, is it? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422000/#Comment_422000" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T22:42:55+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 10:42PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In my Gunplay example, I was saying "the player putting more points in Gunplay means they clearly want to use it.

Also, if you want to use gunplay a lot, you don't need the system to make you.

It has a key-like system, but each player is responsible for a different player's key, and the key goes through a development arc (which is not scripted) as it gets triggered, ending in the character having to face it (I think they are always problematic?) and can overcome it, succumb to it or accept it.</blockquote>\nI like these ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422004/#Comment_422004" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T03:37:37+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  3:37AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hey Rickard?

They feel like they are good at this difficult system and getting better at it. In which case arcane and baroque mechanics that have a clear feedback loop for improved skill may be one route to training the player in intrinsic motivation. Of course, human social feedback can also fulfil that role.\n<blockquote>To me, we communicate. Using game mechanics or talking to each other are different kinds of communication.

I think it gets a bit tricky. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory" rel="nofollow">Self Determination Theory</a>, for example, places intrinsic motivation within the three needs of competence, relatedness, and autonomy. Social rewards, such as verbal praise and positive feedback can fulfil the need for relatedness and increase the sense of autonomy. So if we have a token that's explicitly an encapsulation of social approval, with no mechanical benefit, its a part of that communication.<br/><br/>Most mechanical benefits increase what the character is allowed to do in the fiction. Increased choice benefits autonomy, so insofar as the reward improves the player's sense of choice and makes them feel like they have more options should improve the player's intrinsic motivation.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that all mechanical rewards will have this effect; a Monty Hall campaign breaks the link between competence and reward and thus destroys the intrinsic motivation to improve the character. Likewise, it suggests that a social reward that doesn't reflect competence (too-easy social recognition?) will also decrease the player's intrinsic motivation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422009/#Comment_422009" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T05:52:22+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  5:52AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But that's a big assumption, and saying that how good my character is at a skill is always the same as how much I want to use the skill seems weird to me.</blockquote>\nIt depends on how safe you want to play your character really.

Instead of "your character benefits", maybe something more like "your fictional input gets more attention and players have their fictional input interact more with yours".<br/><br/>Damn. That phrasing is even worse! Sigh.<br/><br/>Okay, I play because of what I think you, Rickard, have called <i>modeling</i>. Other people ( famously Ron Edwards, although the phrases have gotten out into general use and changed a bit) have referred to it as <i>Right to Dream/Celebration of Source Material.</i><br/><br/>Briefly: Some source material ( film, book, TV show, comic, genre, situation) inspires me. I want to play around with it, and I want to get together with other people who share that interest to play around with it.<br/><br/>In playing around with it, there are two main tensions: <br/>1) Getting the thing exactly right in an expected way (reinforcement and knowledge/mastery of source material), and<br/>2) Going outside of the source material at points to input something unexpected that then has to be approached by <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, thus between the players producing something new but still clearly in the family of a love for the source material.<br/><br/>So somewhere in here, we would think  to give rewards that acknowledge success with those two items ( in all of the forms they take). Those rewards then feed up, in some fashion, to the next level.<br/><br/>The next level up is the social level. If this wallowing in source material is fun, I want to do it again. I want to do it with people that I think are especially good at it. This is where social reinforcement and awards come together. It's also where things get a bit muddy.<br/><br/>As set up, most games are there to reward in-fiction success of the only thing you have to use: your character. Succeed ( or at least participate) and your character gets better and is more likely to succeed. The encouragement here is to come back to play again to see that happen.<br/><br/>On the social level though, it really is like that old phrase, <i>It isn't whether you won or lost, it's how you played the game</i>. If you play in a way that makes the play more memorable and enjoyable for the bulk of the other players, you get invited back to play ( or have people take time to show up next time you're organizing a game rather than opting to do, well, anything else).<br/><br/>For me, it's the second one that's interesting, the one on the social level.<br/><br/>Now the Fan-mail, and where this fits in.<br/><br/>You and I are playing PTA. At some point you do something I think is either a) dead right with the source material inspirations or b) a really cool twist that plays with expectations from that source material.<br/><br/>Either way, I like it. I give you a piece of fan-mail.<br/><br/><b>I didn't give you fan-mail so you could make your character more powerful. I don't really give a crap about that.</b><br/><br/>I gave it to you because I think you did something that just made play more fun, with my priorities in mind. I want to acknowledge that. And generally, I'm going to tell you what that thing was exactly that you did.<br/><br/>Later on, when there's resolution mechanics being used and it comes down to choosing a fork in the road of the plot, I've already said I kinda trust your instincts about what's fun in this game. That's what the fan-mail means. You could use it to slightly tilt the odds in favor of fork A (which you prefer) over course B. Which is fine: You're using a physical symbol of my enjoyment of your fiction and my trust in it to possibly produce more stuff that I'll enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422025/#Comment_422025" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T09:13:37+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  9:13AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really interesting and I think I've got a clearer idea of what you're getting at Rickard. Thanks for answering my questions.<br/><br/>One thing that sticks out to me: in your first post, you mention "getting xp for using the game mechanics by rolling dice is sound... getting fate points for negative aspects is a bribe." I see what you're getting at here, but I'm not sure I agree entirely. Activating Aspects and spending/gaining xp is <i>part of the game mechanics</i>. "Roll the dice when you attempt a risky action" and "players get a Fate point for calling on their negative aspects" are both rules in the book, and both vital to how Fate works.

This only works when you play the game over very long time periods, right? How long does it take to transcend if you push the system? Can you do it in one session? Can you do it in Lady Blackbird (which uses keys but is short, right?)?

But I can't really use them as examples on these forums, since very few people here have played Matin\xe9 (which uses keys) or Prosopop\xe9e (which uses fanmail).

Colliding challenges are like "Take the $100.000 loot and let the bad guy get away, or do your duty as a cop". The money are the bribe in this case, but you could also have a colliding challenge that says "Will you follow your drive to keep your mum safe or will you follow your duty? The bad guy is your mum! Now what do you do?". The important part in this kind of challenge is the player making a decision.

A lot of examples I've seen so far in this thread are from a perspective - a play style - that uses numbers, and assumes that you need to succeed. I'm not talking about throwing away the rules. Just that you probably don't need the workaround with the bribe. Be more honest about what you want the players to do. Chess doesn't suggest things or try to bribe the player.

I guess I should have specified "rpg" instead of just "game," because Chess is too far removed from this genre to be an apt comparison. I meant "how does a mechanically heavy RPG, with dice and numeric statistics, operate without systemic bribery?" Is it possible? Can you reward fictional positioning without making it a bribe? In Archipelago, if your character has set up a situation where failure is not an option, then you will simply succeed. That's not bribery or luring.

Few games emphasize this and few games reinforce or otherwise promote this kind of play.<br/><br/>  Think about a situation where a player has their character do something that ruins the game because they were playing their character "in character." This is fun for them, they made that character that way. But now a simple "meet the king, get a quest" scene has becomes  "get chased by the guards, get arrested, have a trial" scenes...<br/><br/>  How would Keys work as a game mechanic in your ideal game? I am not trying to antagonize you, just asking. I have a Key on my character sheet, Key of Compassion. What happens when I feel like playing my character in a compassionate way? Or what happens when other players throw me a plot hook tat has the potential for my character to act compassionately? You are right, regardless of the mechanics, when that happens, I have fun. How do other players help me have fun. What helps keep me playing the character I made and not the way I feel that day? I think these are problems that occur in gaming. They are not big, earth-shattering problems like table-flipping, but this is a problem that I think we can solve.<br/>  Any ideas?<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422052/#Comment_422052" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T15:43:21+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  3:43PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think flatly describing in-play rewards as "bribes" off the bat goes a bit far and agree that they <i>can be</i> bribes. I reacted to them very badly when I first saw them in the old <i>Deadlands</i> game. Of course, I'd come to it from <i>GURPS</i>, where the incentive (bribe/pay) was all up front and you were on your honour after that; and such systems are a bit infamous for the flexibility of players' honour after chargen.<br/><br/>I think the difference between bribe or sincere, non-manipulative reward turns on acknowledgment, as others have implied, and just want to contribute my two bits from the workplace. I'm reasonably well-paid in a field with pay that should let anyone with a modicum of sense live comfortably. I've gotten bonuses related to company and team performance a bunch of times in my career. And at some times I've hated it, and at others I've loved it. It's always been about whether I hear I'm getting this bonus because my manager fought for it because he understood (and demonstrated to me) my and my team's contribution. If I get that, I'm proud and happy, and also enjoy the money. I'd enjoy the praise regardless, and the money makes it concrete. If I get a form letter about my "hard work" and clear demonstration that the issuer has no clear idea what I even do, I actually resent it. I'll still buy stuff with it that I want or need, but it's a lot less fun.<br/><br/>I am emphatically not saying system doesn't matter! I prefer Keys to vague guidelines about "rewarding roleplaying." They give me clear guidelines about what to contribute to the game fiction (something I have picked because it's fun anyway), how to signal that I've hit the Key, and what bonus I get back. The Key is a little game itself, a simple yet powerful lever. I think Aspects are more vague, but succeed in similar ways.<br/><br/>There may be better ways to structure Keys, Aspects, and such ilk; I noodle on ideas for them sometimes. They also may just not work for players who will never like such things or who've had lousy times with similar-looking systems that are poorly implemented, either in the text or at the table. I hope this thread can teach me more about how to make the reward something everyone can enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422057/#Comment_422057" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T18:25:17+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  6:25PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a LOT going on in this thread. I've read through this labyrinth twice and still find <br/>a lot of branches to explore. There will probably be more by the time I post this so (just <br/>for my own clarity, if no-one else's), could we use the following very loose definitions as <br/>a common ground? :<br/><br/>A Bribe is something beneficial offered for something you don't want to do (Rickard is <br/>offered Xp for Keying off his "I Love Dog-candy" Key).<br/><br/>A Reward is something offered for something that you (in general) enjoy doing (Rickard is <br/>offered Xp as a Reward for returning a lost thread (dog) to it's poster (owner) which he <br/>immediately cashes in for a +1 Thread Retrieval bonus - cake begets cake!).<br/><br/>An Award (my own fray in the thread) is unexpectedly offered for something you would have <br/>done anyway (Rickard is Awarded the Xp Citation for Exploring Known Waters to Unknown Depths <br/>and immediately hawks it for high-fives... and Xp!). <br/><br/>I raise the last point because some systems are up front with the "something offered" and <br/>others much less so. We know how much a Key is worth, it's written on the character sheet; <br/>not so much the value of defeating a trap in D&amp;D. I cite this <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnD_DMG_XPFinal.asp" rel="nofollow">link </a>to D&amp;D's Xp system. Note <br/>how calculated the Xp is for killing monsters but how hand-wavey story/roleplaying is <br/>treated. If Xp is the player's motivation for playing then we can guess what they will do in <br/>D&amp;D to get that Xp (and it won't be exploring the plight of underprivileged goblins).<br/><br/>If killing and looting isn't your "thing" then Xp in D&amp;D is a Bribe. You want to role-play? <br/>Then ya gotta kill and loot to maintain the ability/strength to survive in order to <br/>Role-Play. Ya can't play-act your way out of the Tomb of Horrors.<br/><br/>XP for killing and looting in order to power-up to be better at killing and looting is a <br/>closed loop cycle, regardless of whether it's a bribe or a reward. It's also the reason many <br/>of us left it behind. You get cake for eating cake. But sometimes I want pie for eating <br/>cake. Hell, give me money (Fate points, tokens, narrative control) and I'll BUY what I want.<br/><br/>This leads to the disconnect between compelling an Aspect for Fate points/gaining Xp for <br/>Keys/getting Pie for eating Cake. <br/><br/>Rickard: "The thing is, getting XP for using the game mechanics by rolling dice is sound. It <br/>makes sense that: if you do something, you can then do some more.<br/>Getting XP for following a key isn't. I didn't use any game mechanics - I just created a <br/>situation. Yet I still getting XP. That's a bribe.<br/>I'm getting FATE points for using negative aspects. That's a bribe."<br/><br/>That's a bit of a Simulationist perspective (to use the vernacular). I do something, I get <br/>better at it = good, real-life observation/simulation. I do something, I get better at <br/>something else = bad, disconnected meta-gaming.<br/><br/>But what if I want to emulate the fiction rather than simulate the genre? What if the <br/>connection exists in the fiction rather than the physics? What if I want my character to <br/>have a weakness/flaw/terrible secret? and NOT be punished for it?<br/><br/>- I'm a farm boy who inherits my father's sword and goes of to rescue the princess from the <br/>dark lord. All good so far. But then I learn that the Princess is really my sister and the <br/>dark lord is really my father. And my father wants me to turn to the dark side. And he says <br/>that if I won't join him, maybe my sister will. Cue man-boy whiney "Nooooooo!" and I unleash <br/>my dark anger on him. <br/><br/>The game just compelled my ASS(pect); the game just Keyed me in the nuts! <br/>Used my sister/girlfriend against me to force(bribe?) a confrontation with the Dark Lord/Side. I <br/>WANT THAT! That's <i>WHY </i>I chose it. But what's more, I want that shiny Fate Point it dangled in front of me to help deal with the situation. Do I use that Fate Point to resist the Dark Side? Beat the Dark Lord? Resolve the tingly feelings I have for my sister and friend-zone her to settle the weird love triangle between me, her and my best buddy? <br/><br/>If I WANT that problem/secret/flaw/weakness and I WANT the Fate Point that results from it, <br/>how is that a Bribe? And if the use of that Fate point is connected to some aspect of the <br/>flaw/problem/etc, then that's a closed loop too; just a fictional/story closure. I'm not <br/>saying that's how every version of Fate works but it certainly could work that way.<br/><br/>And what about Xp for keys? WOULDN'T resisting the Dark Side, defeating the Dark Lord or <br/>resolving the icky,sticky relationship I have with my disturbingly attractive sibling make <br/>me a better Jedi? How would it not? And so, I spend that Xp on improving my Jedi Mind Tricks <br/>and gaining a +1 to my photon sword skill and BECOME a better Jedi. From Xp gained by not <br/>doinking my twin and not letting dad have a go at her. No bribe needed.<br/><br/>Rickard: "If the game wants me to do something, it should make me do it because I want to. Otherwise, I should play another game. A game shouldn't have to bribe me. A game should tell me what to do. Negative aspects should be as fun to activate as positive ones without getting negative response from the system. Keys should be followed up in new scenes with similar themes.<br/><br/>I don't really subscribe to this theory (or fully understand it). The game should do what <b>I </b> want. I should make it do what I want because I want it. It shouldn't coerce me into a narrow vision of what it wants me to play (I know, I know, I just pissed off all those "focused game design" types). BUT resolving one Key SHOULD suggest the next Key or expand the scope of the current Key. "Now everyone knows the Princess is my sister and that makes her a target. If my silence can no longer protect her then my light sabre will - until I can teach her to protect herself."<br/><br/>THAT'S my new weakness/flaw/problem. <b>I </b> chose it, not the game. No bribe needed. <br/><br/>And this is just <i>one small part </i> of what this thread touches upon. How about: "If ya wanna know what a game is <i>about</i>, look at its Reward system". Then there's that whole business of guns vs swords.  I'm working on a system that has no modifiers, no skill numbers. Every character is a Hero in the story because they all can affect the story in their own unique ways. Your swash-buckling swordsmanship does not numerically equate to my roguish charm. Can anyone think of a system where-in every member of the Fellowship of the Ring is equally viable? Where Sam is as effective (not powerful, but story-effective) as Gandalf? Or where Moonglum might be more interesting to play than Elric?  Where the Reward is playing the character you want to play, doing the things your character is good, lucky or even bad at and still be effective and meaningful?  There's NOTHING magical about a +2 sword... unless your game Rewards you for buying into that.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422062/#Comment_422062" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T21:48:24+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  9:48PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since this thread is about rewards, I thought I'd share this video about motivational theory: <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-u6XAPnuFjJc?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/u6XAPnuFjJc/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span> (about 10 minutes, and well presented).  It's about research designed to motivate workers, so they talk about money as the reward, but it's also really fascinating how counterintuitive the outcomes were:<br/>- for tasks that don't require cognition, eg manual labour, increasing the reward increases the productivity<br/>- for tasks that <i>do</i> require cognition, even a little bit, increasing the reward <i>decreases</i> the productivity.<br/>And that's across the board, from well heeled to low heeled, and in different cultures.  So it's possible that focusing a game too much on reward systems might actually decrease player abilities to nut through a logic/strategy puzzle like winning a combat.  (But so long as everyone's having fun, there's no problem with that.)<br/><br/>What they do recommend is that for high level thinking activities the strategy of offering more and more money isn't as helpful as offering enough so that the person doesn't have to worry about it and giving them less tangible incentives, like a pleasant workspace, a good team dynamic, and opportunities to be creative and autonomous.  I know for me that the latter strategy is true - my main goal for straight money rewards is to have enough so I can get what I need and some of what I want, and any extra goes in my rainy day account so I won't have to worry if something random happens in the future.  I mean, it's <i>nice</i> to get a payrise, but my working conditions are a much bigger deal to me.  Ditto for roleplaying - I won't stay in a group with a poor social vibe, and I find games that require me to keep paying attention to my character sheet (like Monster of the Week and I guess other AW-family games where you have to keep marking experience frequently) pull me out of the fiction, and I don't roleplay as well.  In the very light weight version of Fate that my long term group uses - we don't actually keep track of Fate points between sessions, or bother messing around with skills, we just figure our GM will be reasonable in assessing what our character will be good at - I'm much happier.  We invoke Aspects a lot to influence dice rolls, and enjoy making up silly names for the rolls we're making.  And when Fate points do come up, it's normally a signifier that the issue is important - people will often take an Aspect invocation that puts their character in a 'worse' situation, because it's going to make things interesting for everyone.  It's a system that probably wouldn't work well for everyone, but it's a good fit for the way we happen to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422064/#Comment_422064" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T22:23:11+00:00" title="September 26, 2013 10:23PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Can anyone think of a system where-in every member of the Fellowship of the Ring is equally viable?

I've used conflicting bribes in order to create tension, that is reward behavior I don't want people to engage in too much. If you want to incentivize playing a hero with a dark side, I know of no more effective way than to reward them for doing bad things. If you just say "hero with a dark side", I find a lot of people play up the dark side angle too much and end up with a psycho killer. But if you reward them for playing up their dark side, they'll do it less. Playing up the dark side is now "dirty" and means taking a bribe. Of course, it won't work if you don't want people to do it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422066/#Comment_422066" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T22:58:54+00:00" title="September 26, 2013 10:58PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jargon Alert:<br/><br/><i>Bribe = A vestigial gamist award mechanic in a game either designed for other priorities or played by a group with non-gamist priorities.</i><br/><br/>I know, GNS is thought of badly these days, but I needed to shorthand the concept.<br/><br/>Am I about right here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422069/#Comment_422069" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T00:21:14+00:00" title="September 27, 2013 12:21AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me.

Playing TSOY it is a matter of player and group culture how long it takes - I can't recall anyone doing it in a single session, although there is no mechanical brake preventing you from doing it.

For me, one of the purposes of a game is to put everybody on the same side of how to play the game. For example, <b>Once Upon a Time</b> has a gaming element and a storytelling element. When the people focusing on the game element are taking control, it usually results in bad stories but can be a strategic game. When people focusing on the storytelling, the stories are usually good but it's a bad strategic game. Those two elements in that game contradicts each other, and I would think Once Upon a Time would be a better game if it were better at explaining ONE way of playing it.\n<blockquote>How would Keys work as a game mechanic in your ideal game? </blockquote>\n<b>Jason </b>can take this in too.<br/><br/>A game should have a clear direction. Lets say that the game is about your character transcending - we don't care in this example about how. Just that the character will transcend. That's why we play this game, possibly sprinkled with some feelings that may come along. If you don't buy into this concept, then don't play the game.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games are played out in scenes. You can't really avoid that. Let the Keys take a part in how the scenes are created or give directions (but not telling the outcome) in where the scene will go. Force the participants to make them part of the game by using them in the structure of play. If we take American Psycho, as an example. What's the direction of that movie, and what keys are triggered on the way? Each scene will reveal something, escalate into something more, or show a decision along the way to the end. Each scene take part of the end result in some way.<br/><br/>So while playing, you got two things to think about, given from the game itself (the participants will add more). The goal of the game, i.e. where the game wants to take you, and the direction in each scene on the way to the goal. I know this is really abstract but I think this is more concrete than trying to bribe the player to go this way. In the end, the result will be the same - but in my proposition the participant is aware of what's going on and I feel in the other, with the bribes, it creates a false feeling of choice.<br/><br/>The game is giving you keys to use - keys that make things happen in the game - but the game is also making you choose if you want to activate a key or not. Why? That's a false choice. The game wants you to activate keys. Is the game fun if you refuse the use of all keys? This goes with all kinds of bribes. Getting artha, getting XP for keys, bonus dice and much more. Getting +2 to do something (like acting out a seduction) is a false choice, because the game obviously wants you to do it. So why not do it? It's still your choice to choose fight or seduce. It's still your choice which keys that you want to use. The game can't force you to do that, unless it's as narrow as <b>Lady Blackbird</b>. But the game can, and will ... and should, offer different kinds of ways of playing out a situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422086/#Comment_422086" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T08:21:28+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  8:21AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the game can give you the choice of <i>when</i> to activate your keys, and the "requirement" rules have a harder time doing that, I think.

I think it gets a bit tricky. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory" rel="nofollow">Self Determination Theory</a>, for example, places intrinsic motivation within the three needs of competence, relatedness, and autonomy. Social rewards, such as verbal praise and positive feedback can fulfil the need for relatedness and increase the sense of autonomy.<b> So if we have a token that's explicitly an encapsulation of social approval, with no mechanical benefit, its a part of that communication.</b><br/><br/>Most mechanical benefits increase what the character is allowed to do in the fiction. Increased choice benefits autonomy, so insofar as the reward improves the player's sense of choice and makes them feel like they have more options should improve the player's intrinsic motivation.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that all mechanical rewards will have this effect; a Monty Hall campaign breaks the link between competence and reward and thus destroys the intrinsic motivation to improve the character. Likewise, it suggests that a social reward that doesn't reflect competence (too-easy social recognition?) will also decrease the player's intrinsic motivation.</blockquote>\nIt wasn't a short article to read. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Good point about how social approval can increase the intrinsic reward. It's complicated to talk about rewards. We haven't touched the subject of the size of the reward. A minor one will perhaps insult the participant, a major one will make the participant do the task for the reward itself. We haven't brought up how <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html" rel="nofollow">often and how regularly the rewards</a> should be given. But I'm grateful that we haven't because that's not the topic here - it's just one part of the reward we're talking about. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I hope that everybody agrees on that the intrinsic awards are what we're looking for, i.e. the good feeling you get when you complete, or while doing, a task. I wouldn't blow up the effect of the overjustification effect, where the Wikipedia article states: "...intrinsic motivation is diminished by expected, tangible rewards in both children and adults, especially when the reward is given for simply performing a task, regardless of the results. Nontangible rewards, such as verbal praise, and unexpected rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation."<br/><br/>Getting fan mail isn't something you can expect. What bothers me, however, is that the game isn't clear of what it expect of it's players. Why are you given XP for doing a task that may not be related to what you just done? I can understand if you are given XP for combat to raise combat skills. In best case scenario, fan mail is what the group is expecting of the participant. But that's something I think the game should take care of. It should build social relations. It should build a communication between the participants. Roleplaying games today are bad at doing that. The design philosophy that created bribes is one cause to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422090/#Comment_422090" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T08:37:24+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  8:37AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2013 8:38AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But the game can give you the choice of <i>when</i> to activate your keys, and the "requirement" rules have a harder time doing that, I think.

I interpret "making it a requirement" to be something like "every scene should focus on a key" and that's pretty blunt. But if the game just states "you have these keys and they should be in some scenes", you risk the players forgetting about them because they don't really do anything. Flawed as the XP reward is (or is argued to be), the fact that something mechanically relevant happens when you make the choice can aid focus. Every time you ping a key the group is reminded that it's a thing they want to get into the story.<br/><br/>Here's an alternative I've thought of using in my current project Anatman: Every character has one or two themes. A theme is a bit like a key, so it's a "love theme" or a "revenge theme" or whatever. After each scene, you look at your themes and see if they were touched upon in the scene. If a theme was present and relevant to the scene, you check off a box. After a certain number of checks you reach a point on the sheet where there's a bigger box. This means the theme has been touched upon enough so that's an important element. As a reward, the theme gets an entire scene dedicated to it, and some sort of development should happen. The theme escalates. After some more pings, the theme reaches a point where it should climax and either disappear or change into a different theme. The love theme could change into a theme of jealousy, for example. This would work as a story pacing mechanism, but also on a social level you could go "Haha! Another check on my love theme!" and remind and focus the group.<br/><br/>Here's a different idea for a bribeless skill mechanic: Most of your skills are pretty normal and just color, but there are two types of special skills: strong and weak skills. A strong skill is something your character does well. You want to include it in the story because you get to show off your character's awesome. A weak skill is something they do badly and you want to include it in the story because you get to show off your character's humanity or whatever. A strong skill has a number of checks, and you can use one of these in a conflict to win it by using your awesome skill. A weak skill can be used similarly to lose a conflict automatically. After a number of checks, you unlock a bigger box. This box does the opposite. For once, your character's awesome skill fails them. For once, your character overcomes their weakness. This, too, becomes a story arc and pacing thing. You could even include some randomness and roll a die for the skill.

A good, active GM will then offer you opportunities to check boxes for that.

Sometimes you've got an idea for a great scene and it doesn't touch on any theme. In some games it might be ok, but I'd be wary. It's like the games that stipulate that you need a (mechanical) conflict in every scene. That's "blunt" to me. I could say "inflexible". Rolling a certain number of dice in a conflict is of course also "inflexible", and it causes problems sometimes, as well, with conflicts generating outcomes that are bad for the story. But I think conflicts are more of a blunt problem. If you're in a conflict and rolling dice, there aren't that many ways to go. But with scenes the possibilities are endless. Of course, placing restrictions on that can be great; we do need restrictions. I just reacted to your statement that "If you want people to do it, you should make it a requirement". That's not always a good solution, and I wanted to give some counterexamples.<br/><br/>CarpeGuitarrem: With the definitions of "bribe" that Rickard uses in this thread, I don't think you could see my first system as a bribe. The system rewards pinging the themes by making them important. The reward is related to the thing and enhances it. It's only a bribe (again, according to the definition of this thread) if the reward is disconnected from the activity that triggers it. I'm not 100% convinced that's a meaningful distinction, however, so do criticize it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422102/#Comment_422102" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T12:04:49+00:00" title="September 27, 2013 12:04PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scrape: I'm sure you could get around that problem, too.

And I know Rickard loves synergy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here's another system: Every player has a couple of markers. Once I develop my theme a bit, I place the marker by that theme. That marker is now up for grabs. Another player can ping my theme and claim the marker. They can then reuse that marker to develop their own themes. This way, if you're out of markers, it's a signal to you that you need to start pinging the other players' themes; you've been too selfish! If you've got too many markers, that's a signal that you've been neglecting your own themes. This way the markers again work to focus the group and enhance communication. But in this system, the reward (the marker) is recieved for one activity (pinging someone else's theme) but it feeds into a different activity (developing your own themes). It seems to me that this system would count as a "bribe" by Rickard's definition.<br/><br/>(The point of this post isn't the system in itself, whether or not it's good or bad, but whether or not it fits Rickard's definition of a "bribe".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422109/#Comment_422109" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T13:10:00+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  1:10PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry. Wall of text slightly out of phase with the current topic.<br/><br/>I'm only peripherally aware of Prime Time Adventures (reviews, forum talk) but Fan Mail <br/>sounds kinda like Awesome Points from Old School Hack. Awesome Points are to be handed out <br/>freely and often by the GM and other players when someone does something "awesome" (rolls <br/>high, rolls low, makes a good joke, brings popcorn, - it's really left up to the group to <br/>decide what constitutes "awesome", in game or out). <br/><br/>BUT it carries a mechanical benefit, so there's really no need to ever be without them. <br/>There's no stringent "economy" to them. "Hey buddy, I see you're out of Awesome Points. <br/>That's AWESOME! Here, have a point". ANd yet, comments and actual play reports on the site <br/>indicate that people like them ( "Great game last night and the Awesome Points were flying <br/>around the table!"). I don't get it, myself, but there it is. Different strokes, I guess.<br/><br/>Now, you (Rickard) mention "the need to succeed". I assume you mean winning and losing. If I <br/>want my character to fail and he fails, that's a success. I got what I wanted by losing. <br/>This can work in a story game where goals aren't always about coming out on top. In an old <br/>school dungeon crawl it doesn't work so well. Let's stick to a story game for now. <br/><br/>That being the case, let's also see if we are of a similar mind:<br/>A mechanical bonus is about "winning". A +2 sword is desirable because it increases your <br/>combat prowess. It helps you win. Stormbringer is a powerful sword and will help you "win" a <br/>fight but it comes at a great cost: it's a cursed weapon. It will cause more grief than it <br/>is worth AND ultimately kill you. If you use (are used by) Stormbringer, you WILL "lose". <br/>That's no good in a tactical game of dungeon crawling but perfect for a story game. It also <br/>requires no numbers, just a good idea of what it's about - how it will affect the fiction.<br/><br/>Cool. Let's focus on what a game like this might look like. Interesting(?) side point: I also <br/>came up with the notion of ticking off boxes (as per Simon's post) as I thought about this. <br/>The reason being that I don't actually like passing tokens (Fate/Awesome points, poker <br/>chips, glass beads, even dice) around the table. Regardless of what they represent, I would <br/>rather have my character resources (sheet, cards, even tokens) in front of me or off to the <br/>side. I don't know if it's an "immersion" thing but I find it distracting. Perhaps there IS <br/>a feeling of being bribed by the physical act of handing something to someone in return for <br/>something. Maybe I just don't like my character resources being touched.<br/><br/>If we disavow the notion of numbers, modifiers and "winning", we must still resolve <br/>situations. Let's imagine a character sheet that contains situations.  Each of these <br/>situations tells us something about the character and the problems you (the player) want to <br/>face. These are Story Arcs and they have unchecked boxes beside them. The number of boxes <br/>represents how important that story Arc is to you - more boxes = more important. <br/><br/>Every time you confront a situation, you resolve what happens by describing the result. You <br/>create fictional details about it and tick a box. It doesn't matter if your character wins <br/>or loses or merely complicates things; it only matters that you confront the situation to <br/>progress the story Arc and tick a box. The Arc won't be resolved until you check off all <br/>the boxes. Good (that is to say, well-chosen) situations will involve other Characters so <br/>that you may each tick a box in a scene. Or you may just be there to help another character <br/>resolve a portion (box) of their story Arc. The fiction you create provides the guidelines <br/>(rules) to what is possible. You can't resolve one of my boxes unless I accept your fiction <br/>and want that to happen, and vice-versa. Thus, I control my character's story and you <br/>control your's but hopefully they will cross/collide and involve us in each other's Arcs.<br/><br/>Let's join a game in progress. My character has already resolved "Coming to terms with my <br/>human half" and have evolved this to "Loyalty to my crew and friends". I must also still <br/>deal with my "Adherence to logic". Your character must deal with his nemesis and perhaps <br/>come to terms with his own mortality. Frankly, those are your problems, I have my own <br/>character to worry about. The ship and all hands will be lost unless I do something. I enter <br/>the warp core chamber and manually operate the matter/antimatter mixture. It's lethal but I <br/>can't die yet; I haven't resolved my story Arcs.<br/><br/>Me - "Ship..out of danger?"<br/><br/>You - "Yes." ("Loyalty"- second to last tick). You may consider if/how that affects your <br/>"Nemesis".<br/><br/>Me -  "Don't grieve, Captain. It is logical. The needs of the many out-weigh.."<br/><br/>You - "The needs of the few."<br/><br/>Me -  "Or the one". ("Logic" - tick and done.) "I have been and always shall be your friend. <br/>Live long and prosper" (final tick on "Loyalty". All Arcs resolved. My character can die <br/>now).<br/><br/>If you didn't confront your own "Mortality" at some point during this, you may be playing <br/>"wrong" ; )  Of course, you may also have other plans such as "Can't get past the death of my <br/>friend". Until that Arc plays out, I'll just play Lt.Savik.<br/><br/>There is no "win/lose"; only "Resolution" to what's important to my character. We share the fiction but I control my story Arcs and pacing. You have no power over my character and nothing to bribe me with. At worst, anything you add will merely be irrelevant to me. Hopefully it will add to my story Arcs and I will add to yours. There's no need for a GM and there are goals/definitive end states but they can be added as the fiction progresses or neatly resolved at about the same time (perhaps in a two hour time-limit). Issues of shared fiction are probably best left to another thread.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422110/#Comment_422110" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T13:23:23+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  1:23PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a>: That game structure is reminding me substantially of Chuubo's Marvellous Wish-Granting Engine.

If a character played by me fails, it's still interesting, and I still get to play. <br/><br/>I have a whole host of characters to take up if the first character is destroyed/written out of the story.<br/><br/>The characters I get to play don't have to be important or powerful or wise or notably good/notably evil.<br/><br/>Even if I have no character at all in a given moment, I have a ton of things I can be doing related to play. Even just sitting quietly and actively listening and observing is part of play for me.<br/><br/>Oh heck, I can think of a bunch of others if I really wanted to.<br/><br/>I think, perhaps, if that type of GMing experience is mostly one's RPG experience ( even when later applied to GM-less games), then character rewards or similar seem a bit silly and primitive to chase after.<br/><br/>I think those gamist-ish rewards make more sense if you're approaching this from mainly being a character player in a traditional/classic style of rpg ( particularly in a long-term/campaign style of play rather than one-shots or short campaigns).<br/><br/>I know at one point, I had a thread going on this site about a game concept I was working on that was very loosey-goosey and largely GM-less, and one of the active participants in the discussion floored me by interjecting how it was really important to them that they see how their character was becoming more powerful. It floored me because I simply found that foreign conceptually to anything related to what I was talking about. It just wasn't important to me at all.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422149/#Comment_422149" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-28T09:26:30+00:00" title="September 28, 2013  9:26AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            komradebob: Ha, yeah.

Then why does the mechanic need to make the character more powerful? Couldn't you just use M&amp;M's instead? I wonder if the discussion is fruitful if people that don't care about the power increase of the character is answering with "I give it because of showing the appreciation, and not the reward itself." I get why fan mail exist - I just think it's misguided in it's implementation.</blockquote>\nBecause M&amp;Ms have nothing to do with the game.<br/><br/>It helps create a cohesive space. Remember there's a theme at work here--we're writing a TV show. We're getting fan feedback. We're trying to give the fans what they want. I give you fan-mail because the game tells me to give you fan-mail when I'm excited about what your character is doing. You can then use that fan-mail to help your character succeed. There are other cool things you could do with fan-mail depending on what you want to say about the relationship between the writers of the show and the audience is ... but I don't think "the fans-like the character so let's give the character what they (the character) want so the fans are happy" is a bad thing to say about that relationship.<br/><br/>Talking about bribes vs. rewards ... I don't know this smacks of Platonic Forms, to me and I don't like Platonic Forms. I love the FATE economy. I think aspects are smashing. I think the evoke a wonderful feeling in play and they do a number of different jobs without forcing the players to learn too many different mechanics. Rather than list off the things I feel the FATE economy does, I'll say this: I don't always know what I want as a player or as a GM. I'm not always charismatic enough or clever enough to make something cool and interesting and rewarding happen. The abstractions of the game can allow me to feel rewarded even when the story slows down part-way through a session--I can enjoy the beats of the system and the rewards and the dice even if I don't explicitly enjoy this particular battle we're having. These bribes/rewards also give my character sovereignty in some systems; Wren might be much more fond of killing people than I am and she's that way because I <i>wanted</i> her to be, because I wanted to see what would happen to her in this world we built ... but my first feeling in a scene wouldn't have been to fling lightning around and damn anyone who got in my way if I hadn't made it so mechanically rewarding through skill selections and Aspects. The system isn't bribing me--I'm bribing myself and I'm bribing the GM and the GM is bribing me and we're all trying to get cool interesting things to happen even when we're not quite clever enough or practiced enough to do it without systems of abstraction and, yes, bribery.<br/><br/>If you don't like the bribes in a system and what they encourage you to do ... I'd posit that the system could be quite fine. It's just not the right system for you. Me? I like being bribed in certain ways. I like feeling the pressure in Apocalypse World between wondering whether Proust would lie to the priest, whether it's a good idea, whether I want him to at a meta-level, what my various stats and the results of various moves say is likely to happen, and which stat is highlighted. Highlighted stats throw in that Imp of the Peverse both meta-fictionally and in-fiction--they cause your characters to surprise you and each other and they create novel play-states. FATE's aspects rest in the <i>other</i> palm; they sometimes encourage you to surprise others and surprise yourself with your character but more often they drag your character toward their destiny when you wouldn't have otherwise thought to engage with the character's identity over engaging with the table and the dice.<br/><br/>All of this bribery, and the crossing of the 4th wall ... sure it's often not directly related to the action at hand. But that's ok. Because it ties the whole table--players, characters, world--together and keeps the various parts communicating with each other to create a coherent experience. Games don't need to have bribes, but I'm genuinely surprised to see comments <i>against</i> things like FATE's aspects and Keys with experience points as design features rather than simply as a matter of preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422172/#Comment_422172" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-29T23:40:58+00:00" title="September 29, 2013 11:40PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I feel like, if you know what story you want to tell and how to tell it, you don't need system.

So I don't really know where to begin. And more, I already tried to clarify most of what you said in this thread already. The only thing I could find was the thing below.\n<blockquote>Because M&amp;Ms have nothing to do with the game.</blockquote>\nMy point being: fan mail as a mechanical reward has nothing to do with the <i>situation</i>. M&amp;M has as much to do with player appreciation as fan mail, which was what I was talking about with <b>komradebob</b>, who didn't care about if fan mail was a mechanical reward or not.<br/><br/>That said, I was all into aspects and FATE points before, but over these last two years, I have started to reconsider. Those thoughts are what I was trying to share. Bribes do work, but I feel they work for the wrong reasons. Either you understand what the reward really is trying to achieve, and ignore the mechanical reward, or you will do it for the reward and not because the task itself (a non-mechanical task) is fun to do. Bribes such as keys (and not fan mail) also ring a sense of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422083#Comment_422083" rel="nofollow">false choice</a> to me.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>To talk about something entirely else.

Beyond that, pretty much everything is up for grabs approach-wise, within the realm of things that fit the category "games".<br/><br/>Or, to put it another way, if a bunch of people got together to create a story and there was some sense of structure and goals ( whether written, evolved through play, or simply based on ad hoc methods brought in from participants' prior experience), we are in fact within the realm of "game".<br/><br/>As a fan of multiple different sorts of games, I've come to detest comments that run something like " That isn't really a game because [reasons]. Why don't you just go do [something looked down upon as not-as-good]".<br/><br/>I've watched war gamers bash one another's games with it. Watched war gamers bash classic RPGs with it. Watched classic RPGers bash LARP and freeform and White Wolf games and story-games, oh really just goes on and on. It's one thing to say you don't like a particular style of game and give reasons for that. That I can live with and might even learn something from. Simple dismissal on the basis that "X method isn't <i>really</i> a game" is just tiresome and more about tribalism and gate-keeping than exploring ideas about play.<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Rickard: I was mostly getting at the idea that fan-mail, or something like it might be written with in-game mechanical effects in mind. On the other hand, their more useful function is probably better looked at in the impact it has on the players and play-group as a whole. It could impact a single session game. It could impact multiple sessions. It might not even be in the same game/campaign world. That's the level I'm interested in.<br/><br/>( Also, for the record, I've been deeply impressed with PTA in general, even if I haven't had a chance to play it nearly enough.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422199/#Comment_422199" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T08:56:27+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  8:56AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>komradebob: Ha, yeah.

But I'd like to note that the social psychology research on intrinsic and extrinsic rewards is complicated, and it's definitely more complicated than Wikipedia lets on. There's a lot of meta-analysises that often come up with contradictory positions on whether extrinsic rewards consistently diminish intrinsic rewards (all major players agree that extrinsic rewards can both help and hurt intrinsic rewards depending on situations), and the major theories (like CET and Self-Determination, which have already been mentioned here) also hold very diverse positions on this.<br/><br/>A meta-meta-analysis that feels pretty solid to me is here: <a href="http://ceo.usc.edu/pdf/Ledford_Fang_Gerhart_2013_Intrinsic_Rew_WaWJ.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ceo.usc.edu/pdf/Ledford_Fang_Gerhart_2013_Intrinsic_Rew_WaWJ.pdf</a> , which should at least complicate the idea that social psychology has consistent views on this topic, let alone whether it's easy to apply these conclusions to a specific area, like reward mechanics in indie games.<br/><br/>(By the way, you could totally attack that meta-meta-analysis as being incorrect or focused on the wrong things! The literature reviews that are mentioned in there have a response framework: they mostly refer to and build upon and criticize the previous ones. I'm not actually here to resolve this one way or another, just to sort of add a big heap of caution and warning flag to anything that starts "Science says...")<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422202/#Comment_422202" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T10:23:34+00:00" title="September 30, 2013 10:23AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2013 10:27AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I hope this isn't pulling things too far from Rickard's main points,</blockquote>\nGo nuts and let the the original topic mutate into something else, because I think the first discussion has come to it's end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422205/#Comment_422205" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T11:37:15+00:00" title="September 30, 2013 11:37AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2013 11:40AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Giving someone a fate point in response to an Aspect is not a bribe in any way whatsoever, and any analysis that proceeds from the idea that it is a bribe will inevitably reach an incorrect conclusion about FATE; like when you were young, and did an algebra problem, and made a mistake on line 2, and did the next two pages perfectly, you got a wrong answer.<br/><br/>Fan mail in PTA is also not a bribe - it is compensation for a performance.

In the hack, players started to make meta-jokes about putting their characters in trouble and claiming a fate point for it. It kinda defeated the purpose of the mechanic and some roleplaying moments which would otherwise be cool, became a joke that broke the inmersion a bit. Yet, in PF, all players care was about making good scenes or drop one-liners here and there to create amazing roleplaying moments; and then the same currency was used to create more of those moments by twisting the rules a bit and allowing us to do cool stuff beyond the system limitations,<i> because it made the scene really cool</i>.<br/><br/>In conclussion: It all depends on how you see it. Think of it as a bribe, it will feel as a bribe and you'll start to treat it like that and spread that sensation to the other players. If you treat it like applause, give it proper respect and link it to awesome moments of the game, it will start to shine and acquire a value of it's own.<br/><br/>Another viewpoint about the same issue: some people (like me) feel a bit uncomfortable with praise, either giving or receiving it. This mechanic actually makes it more comfortable to give praise, in the same way a roll on a social trait feels more comfortable than roleplaying the entire interaction, for a player with poor social skills. If your group is totally comfortable with praise, it's easier to see that you'll probably see it as something totally unnecessary that will create more problems than solutions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18841/bribes-and-judgement" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18841/bribes-and-judgement" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18841/bribes-and-judgement/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18841%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18841%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
