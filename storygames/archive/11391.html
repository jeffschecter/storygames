Many of my meetings at work are less than perfect due to the behaviour of the participants - needing to comment without having anything of substance to add, refusal to take responsibility for decision making, aimless digressions from the purpose of the meeting, and so on, and very few of them would fit the standard classification of geek. 'How over why' is pretty common in my experience, as is favouring complexity over simple descriptions - especially in conversations relating to business jargon.<br/><br/>There's an ideal standard, most of the time we fall short, but I'm not convinced this is to do with being geeks as much as it is just a common feature of any human interactions.

For example, using technical terms is universal among geeks - but the types of technical terms vary widely.  Theater geeks will talk about particular plays or stage direction terms - fashion geeks will drop the names of brands or designers as if they expect you to know them, etc.  Similarly, obsessiveness is basically definitional to geeks, and geeks will always favor detail within their domain of geekery.  Music geeks will want to know which symphony you went to hear and who was conducting, etc.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, numerical responses and technology evangelizing are typical of technical geeks (duh).  Other geeks evangelize other things, like geeky sports fans who evangelize for their favorite team.  Lack of interest in outside appearances is usual in a number of geek branches that aren't appearance related.  <br/><br/>Geeks generally tend to get along well with other geeks of overlapping interests, but can seem off-putting or cliquish to those that don't share their obsessions.  In games, I find that sometimes one needs to mediate between those with different social standards.  So, for example, sometimes there is a problem in a geeky crowd with a non-geeky player who comes to the game and just wants to hang out and chat about non-game-related things, whereas others want to focus on the game.  No one is inherently right or wrong here, but there are different priorities.  I don't like to go into detail with meta-discussion that can go around in circles - I think it's better to find a quick compromise a the time, and later talk things out a little more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253633/#Comment_253633" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T03:28:35+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  3:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>The first time I went to a convention (last year), I was really surprised that the facilitator/GM of most games didn't introduce themselves or facilitate a group "say your name and go around the circle" standard kind of first social interaction.

A couple of us did a kind of informal introduction before the GM turned up, but no GM-as-facilitator moment of introduction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253636/#Comment_253636" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T03:57:10+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  3:57AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2010 4:03AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see this article rewritten from a geek perspective, as an analysis of "non-geeks" supposed conversational and social failings.<br/><br/>Obesessed with pointless turn-taking<br/><br/>A slipshod attitude to correctness and completeness<br/><br/>A complete lack of numeracy<br/><br/>Using technical terms incorrectly, or not at all, when talking about technical subjects<br/><br/>Lack of attention to detail<br/><br/>Over-simplifying projects<br/><br/>Brushing over important facts<br/><br/>Obssesed with outward appearance rather than substance<br/><br/>Use time and money-wasting technology                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253637/#Comment_253637" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T04:07:23+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  4:07AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2010 4:10AM by droog.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My old group were abashed RPers.

The unspoken assumption is that non-geek forms of communication are inherently superior. Is this really true? Geek methods of conversation work well for scientific and engineering meetings. Geek conversations drive the development of the technology that generates our society's wealth. Geek conversations have value.<br/><br/>I think that the problem you are trying to address is one of creating a bridge across the gap of how geeks communicate with geeks and how non-geeks communicate with non-geeks. It is not useful to address this gap from only one side. Throw the geeks a rope, instead of being insulting, and maybe folks from both sides can build that bridge.<br/><br/>Thanks for the thought-povoking article, and for reading this reply.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253719/#Comment_253719" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T09:40:05+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  9:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Put me in the old-fashioned camp where "geek" is definitely a perjorative, and geeky behavior serves only to reinforce your affinity with other geeks while widening the gap with Everyone Else.<br/><br/>IMO "anti-geek" is as honorable and correct a position as "anti-racist."

Adhering to your subculture widens the gap between you and the mainstream.  <br/><br/>The difference seems to be in values.  You imply that conforming to the mainstream is a positive thing, whereas I see it as a mostly neutral thing - potentially negative if someone's self-esteem is harmed.  <br/><br/>Anti-Semitic sentiment generally has to do with perception of genetic essence rather than of culture, so it's not a great parallel.  To avoid entanglement with racism, I suspect the best parallels would be of minority European or American cultures.  An issue I see some here in northern California is sometimes encouraging certain parents to have their kids watch junky television and play video games so that they can fit in better with the mainstream.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253748/#Comment_253748" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T10:37:06+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 10:37AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>I was really surprised that the facilitator/GM of most games didn't introduce themselves or facilitate a group "say your name and go around the circle" standard kind of first social interaction.

You saved me some reading--I have little use for someone whose "advice" is "err on the side of shallowness" and "they're not in the least bit interested."

I know that I don't go around introducing people.  I suppose it's a failing on my part, but mostly don't care about peoples names until I do, and I can get buy on "Hey, you" for quite some time.  It's like playing an MMO.  I don't need to know the real names behind the avatars I interact with because the interaction isn't meaningful enough to warrant it.  And honestly, I don't really consider gaming at a convention table a "social" encounter.

Do you just mean someone who doesn't accept, say, invitations to go out to a bar or baseball game?  <br/><br/>I'd say there are a variety of people who live their lives primarily in small communities or in subcultures within a larger one.  (The Amish come to mind - though really someone who just mainly lives her whole life in the same small town is a similar though less extreme example.)  I don't consider staying in a small community to be a bad thing in itself, though obviously those in small cultures can do bad things just as those within larger cultures can.  <br/><br/>All subcultures have some degree of isolation, or they wouldn't be subcultures.

However, I think most of this is good to keep in mind when in mixed or entirely non-geek company. It's just that, as with anything like this, you have to take it as a grain of salt.

The behaviors he's describing are not binary. They're on a scale, and there are some people who desperately need a nudge in the "normal" direction. I am a pretty geeky guy and I am sure I demonstrate some of these behaviors, but listening to some of my friends tell stories while constantly interrupting one another to make sure details are included or are accurate that <i>do not matter to me one bit as the listener</i> drives me insane. I have two friends who are brothers and who watch movies together regularly. Getting them to give me a movie summary in, say, two minutes is impossible because there is this absurd back-and-forth that occurs when one misses or is incorrect on the most minute of facts regarding the movie. There are geeks all along the spectrum, and I am sure that if anyone who is offended by the article went to a gaming convention, chances are you would bump into one or two people who you wish would read and reflect on this article. I got cornered by a guy at a convention once who wanted to go on, at length, about all his Vampire character concepts including a Brujah with a five in all of his physical attributes and a Malkavian who worshipped duct tape.<br/><br/>I have tried over the years to scale back some of my behavior that other people find off-putting. It's not selling out on my identity or acquiescing to the unreasonable demands of "normal people," it's wanting to make other people feel comfortable and at ease in their interactions with me. It's wanting to make sure that I don't inflict the behaviors I find socially frustrating on others. It's wanting to be self-aware and making sure I am doing things in the way that I want to do them. It's wanting to cultivate a kind of <i>social generosity</i>. Oh and it's also about wanting to meet tons of babes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254742/#Comment_254742" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T09:12:59+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  9:12AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>(For instance, I'm certainly not going to stop using large but non-technical words around non-geeks.

But when I try to speak French "casually" or "naturally," I am all-but-tongue-tied. Why? Because my natural vocabulary--the one with which I think (and, no, I don't think in French, yet)--is larger than my French vocabulary. By probably an order of magnitude (I can't say "order of magnitude" in French). The result? I don't speak French to French people. I know some, even. But having to constantly self-edit, just so I can find a French word I know, is remarkably, REMARKABLY tiring and tedious. So much so that I don't even try.<br/><br/>Much like I almost never try to constrain my diction in a "mixed" crowd. I say what I mean, with the best, most-nuanced words at my command. And when folks don't understand a word, 9 times out of 10 they don't ask what it means (I am always impressed when someone does) but rather rely on context, word parts, and guesswork to "keep up with me." So... how do I know that I'm "speaking over someone's head," barring obvious visual cues like eyes glassing over or dropping the subject?<br/><br/>(This all sets aside the very common situation in which another person is not listen to you but listening for key words on which to hang their own statements. Dueling Monologues pretending to be conversation.<br/>It also sets aside the obvious question of "Why should I bother to dumb down my conversation, when it's likely I won't want further conversation with that person at that lower level?" Or "why should I not be myself, to accommodate someone else, in a purely social situation?")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254744/#Comment_254744" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T09:17:22+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  9:17AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

I think you're cool.<br/><br/>But that bit really jumped out at me. It looks, to me, like the<i>definition</i>of anti-social. Why is it their problem if they don't understand you? Why intentionally alienate people with choice of words? I don't get it.<br/><br/>Okay, so all of these other things I look at and I go - hey, this isn't how normal people communicate. I should make an effort to emulate normal communication when talking with non-geeks. Awesome. None of these other things, like using lists or numerical answers or avoiding eye contact, are things that I'm really passionate about. They're just tendencies that I may or may not have to watch in myself, as a geek, to varying degrees.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to vocabulary... I am passionate about the English language. Deeply passionate. To me, it's not a matter of desiring precision when I describe something as "irridescent" instead of "sparkly". It's a matter of loving that we speak a language that is capable of making such distinctions. One of the coolest things I've learned recently is that "struthious" means "of or pertaining to ostriches". Awesome!<br/><br/>These geek social behaviors that other people interpret as weird and off-putting, most of them aren't me. They're just things I do. But my vocabulary of unusual and obscure words, that's me! One of the reasons I married my husband is because he was the first person I met who had a vocabulary bigger than I do! I decided a long time ago that I had to draw a line as to where my shame would end. I don't talk about my love NPR, my deep obsession with books, my love of roleplaying, my forays into game design, or any of the deeply geeky things that I truly love. But damned if I'm going to apologize for my vocabulary and my passion for big and awesome words.<br/><br/>I realize that's anti-social on some level. And I'm willing to conform in all other regards to social norms. (I bathe, I groom myself well, I'm working on improving eye contact, I am very good at small talk and conversing, thank you very much...) Just not on this front, because it feels so disingenuous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

I say what I mean, with the best, most-nuanced words at my command. And when folks don't understand a word, 9 times out of 10 they don't ask what it means (I am always impressed when someone does) but rather rely on context, word parts, and guesswork to "keep up with me." So... how do I know that I'm "speaking over someone's head," barring obvious visual cues like eyes glassing over or dropping the subject?</blockquote>\nI imagine you know when you find out through a third party that one of the people you were talking to thinks you're full of yourself.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I find that sometimes the best, most-nuanced words at my command are different from the best, most-nuanced words <i>for that conversation</i>; in fact, that difference is what makes a conversation fun for me.  Finding the words that really connect with someone else and make them excited and happy to be talking with me is just an entertaining way to play with language.  It's not about dumbing things down (far from it, I love weird and obscure words too much to <i>not</i> use them when I can), it's about getting into the proper groove with someone else and finding a natural conversational style in common, so that at the end of the dialogue we're both pleased by how it went.<br/><br/>In fact, it's so much fun that my most common linguistic sin is doing it inappropriately -- I've been dinged by more than a few professors and supervisors for being too colloquial and casual when giving "serious" presentations, because even when I know I should be adhering strictly to the best vocabulary available, I keep searching for the best vocabulary for different audiences (even audiences who are not actually there).  Sometimes it comes across as me having an irrepressible urge to drag down high-minded proper discourse with slang, profanity, and wordplay, and gives the impression that I am not serious about what I am saying.<br/><br/>But then, I think that's fun, too.  It doesn't work out so well on the internet, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254848/#Comment_254848" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T15:13:52+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  3:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the tricky thing about interactions is the tendency to find fault with one side or the other, or assign responsibility.  <br/><br/>For example, if someone who doesn't speak English well shows up at an established English-speaking game wanting to join, how obligated are the people who were there previously to adjust to make them comfortable?  I don't think that there is a single right answer to this question.  I think the group could respectfully say that they're not going to majorly adjust how they communicate for the new player, or alternately they could shift to use simpler words and more diagrams and miniatures.  <br/><br/>I don't like the idea that one side or the other is wrong and needs to adjust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254853/#Comment_254853" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T16:04:22+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  4:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anna: I totally get where you're coming from now.
