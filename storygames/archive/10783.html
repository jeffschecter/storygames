Basically, interactions should have a chance of making friends or making enemies.  Factions form.  Etc.<br/><br/>What systems do a decent job of modeling relationships dynamically?  If you can give an example, that would be keen.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm not interested in purchase-based relationship systems or side-effect relationship systems.  For instance, I can buy a relationship with resource points in Burning Wheel.  I can get relationships as fallout in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, but that's a side effect. (It's not the only way in either of these systems, I'm just using these as examples of a method). I'm more interested in these interactions being important in game, with mechanical effects, as in <i>Bliss Stage</i> or <i>Breaking the Ice</i>.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Drake                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239165/#Comment_239165" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T11:44:32+00:00" title="October 26, 2009 11:44AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2009 1:57PM by Nathan_H.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday get's kinda close to this...it certainly stares at it...intently.<br/>The relationship thing is somewhat of a side effect, but a really important one.<br/>So, in the Shadow of Yesterday you buy these things called Keys, they're a reward mechanic.<br/>Use them and you get rewarded.<br/>Also, and more importantly they inform the other players what that character is all about.<br/>It's like shorthand.<br/>I've not played Bliss Stage nor Breaking the Ice, so I'll just assume were generally talking about the same thing.<br/>There's a bunch of games that do the relationship thing, but many of them do it rather implicitly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
