A million years from now, humanity has spread across the galaxy and taken countless forms. Vast empires have come and gone like the cresting of waves. But some strange voyagers chose to remain outside the churn of civilizations, pursuing a greater purpose. When a new force comes to the galaxy, will these eternal wanderers remain who they are--or, at long last, change?"<br/><br/>Earlier this year, some of you fine folks offered feedback on an early version of the game, and others may have played a prerelease version at Go Play NW, or at KublaCon, BigBadCon, or DunDraCon in the Bay Area. Thanks again for all the feedback!<br/><br/>I'll be launching a Kickstarter soon for a full version of the game with more art, examples, and play aids, but the basic rules are up now: feedback, reactions, and reviews are always welcome. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/239486/Archives-of-the-Sky-Free-Version" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/239486/Archives-of-the-Sky-Free-Version</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
