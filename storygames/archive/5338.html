The galaxy-spanning Imperium of Man is beset on all sides by ravaging aliens and threatened from within by malevolent creatures and heretic rebels.  Only the strength of the Immortal Emperor of Terra stand between humanity and its annihilation. Mortally wounded by the traitorous Warmaster Horus, the first Space Marine Primarch to devote himself to the foul Chaos Gods, the Emperor has reigned on the life-preserving Golden Throne, neither alive nor dead, for ten thousand years, sustained by the soul-sacrifice of countless millions. His penetrating mind tears through the void of space, powering the Astronomicon alongside a choir of ten thousand psykers, allowing the starships of man to harness the energies of the warp and travel faster than light.<br/><br/>Dedicated to his service are the incorruptible Adeptus Custodes, the Golden Throne Guard, who watch over the God-Emperor's physical shell.  To ensure the Emperor's continuing lucidity and to preserve their own minds from the dark energies of the warp, the Custodes have begun reciting from memory the great Liber Militaris, chronicling 10,000 years of humanity's campaigns against aliens, demons, traitors, and heretics. In between passages, they consult with one another, endeavor to discern the ineffable will of the Emperor, and take part in the high politics that only the Custodes and the High Lords of Terra know.<br/><br/>During recitation from the Liber Militaris, place one gem (d6) on the table to represent each character mentioned.  Whenever a character you control shoots another character, 1) make sure your opponent's gem is within range (24" for standard bolters) and line of sight and 2) roll your gem and try to get under your character's Ballistic Skill (BS). If the attack is successful, the player in charge of the defending character should roll their gem.  Normal Space Marines have a 3+ armor save, but remember that Terminator armor saves on a 2+ and has a 5+ invulnerable save vs. things that ignore armor.  If your opponent fails their save, add that die to your pool and narrate the defending character's gruesome demise.<br/><br/>At the end of each story, split the dice you've won between the following three categories:<br/><br/>DEATH OOO (Don't get this; it means the Emperor strikes you dead.)<br/>WARP OOOOO (Don't get this either; it means the warp is driving you insane.)<br/>POLITICS OOOOOOO (Pursue this; it's your status within the realm of high politics; if you get all 7 dots, you "win.")<br/><br/>P.S.  I will be eternally grateful if anyone comes up with an equipment list for the Adeptus Custodes.  Y'know, so we can describe what they are wearing before we begin play.  I want a chainsword, a powerfist, and a lascannon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christoph" title="Christoph"><img alt="Christoph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/226/n0VY365S2UKM3.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120171/#Comment_120171" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T13:35:04+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  1:35PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jon,<br/>\n<br/>\nNeat setting for <i>1001 Nights</i>!

The book that the Adeptus Custodes read from, then, could be <i>The Night of the Thousand Sons</i> and be full of djinn-like Tzeench demons seducing the Emperor's servents.  Also, that way, you'd only have to use Space Marine and Chaos Space Marine models, which basically use the same rules, plus some demons. You could still have Tyranids attack, I suppose, but surely only heretical Custodes tell stories of xenomorphs, so you might risk being killed outright.<br/><br/>We've also been thinking about using actual models to mark character position instead of gems, and just rolling gems during combat.  Dev also wants to have hand-to-hand combat, so he can use chainswords, so we may go with simplifying the 40K combat rules down to a single attack/defend roll that also determines who gets the mini if they die.  It could be that minis are just assumed to attack each other, unless there's a betrayal going on, and so either one or both could die in any given combat.  Something like that.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about playing your spoils on other players' categories.

While all our stories were about the fall of the Thousand Sons, it seemed like that was not necessary.  We could have had random Tyranid attacks and it would have worked just fine.  It's just a question of how many minis you want to have on hand for the game.  Limiting the stories to specific kinds of characters would be one way of only having to prepare a couple of army types.  I would definitely have loved to be able to drop a big mini with multiple wounds on the table, like a Carnifex or Demon Prince.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121659/#Comment_121659" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T07:12:31+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  7:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You evil people.<br/>\n<br/>\nMust I buy 1001 nights now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Visacard curses you all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121668/#Comment_121668" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T08:33:56+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  8:33AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hopefully Adam Flynn will drop in and comment too.  His characterization and storytelling ability was, as always, super impressive.  It was definitely a loss when he had to hand off the lead genestealer to me in his story, since I had no idea what direction he was trying to take it in.  That alone led us to improvise some rules for narrator characters, to be used in future sessions.<br><br>Parts of the inner stories that stood out for me:\n<ul>\n<li>In my story, about a small world on the edge of the Eye of Terror, right when it first appeared like a scar in the sky... Adam's psyker captain bravely leading a dozen Imperial psykers, all riding in a Land Raider APC, into the dark side of the planet, to send a psykic beacon to the Emperor, informing him about the Eye.  The Emperor, in return, had the entire population killed.</li>\n<li>In Dev's story, about a Chaplain who had come to convert a pair of as-yet undecided Thousand Sons commanders back to the worship of the Emperor... There were two brothers who commanded this unit and I was the one who had been critically injured and was actually a Dreadnaught.  It was very Fullmetal Alchemist.  And I dove in front of my brother when an Imperial assassin attempted to snipe him from afar.  I survived, but the chaplain, thinking I was attacking him, shot me as well, blowing me up.</li>\n<li>In Nathan's story, about yet another Imperial assassin attempting to kill a Thousand Sons commander who had already turned to Chaos... I played the assassin and was unable to talk my way past the two Terminators (hilariously played by Dev and Adam), who would only allow someone's "smoking remains" to come before the commander.  I then became determined to cut off my own limbs, except for one, so that my "smoking remains" might be brought before the commander, but eventually instead borrowed the armor of a Baron and snuck in that way.  I was slightly disappointed, but the story was still pretty awesome.  Dev was terrific as the Baron.</li>\n<li>In Adam's story, about three Imperial agents meeting with a genestealer aboard a space hulk, acquiring crucial information... Nathan's evil female gene-demon seduced my marine off to his doom (our first non-shooting death, I think), but he returned in a horribly mutated form and attempted to push Dev's character off a balcony (we actually used a lot of scenery in this story, which made it way better, I think).  Every character in this story ended up dead, giving us a lot of gems to roll in an attempt to avoid our dark fates.  Still, as Nathan said, his outer character was the only one to ultimately survive.</li>\n</ul>\nYeah, this hack made me want to buy 40K minis more than any 40K game I've ever watched or played in.  Part of it was that the characters actually had personalities and we got to revel in all the absurd 40K fluff.  Also, it was a small-scale skirmish game, basically.  We got to play out a bunch of little small-scale conflicts with, at most, a half-dozen minis involved in each one.  If we threw in some very light tactics and differentiation between the combat abilities of individual pieces (to give a little more individual character to them), it would actually be fairly rewarding as a rules lite miniature skirmish game, not to mention the roleplaying and storytelling aspects.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121680/#Comment_121680" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T09:19:24+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  9:19AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the character sheet I just worked up:<br><br><img alt="image" src="http://thouandone.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/1k1sheet.jpg"/> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121682/#Comment_121682" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T09:36:49+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  9:36AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other (meta)characters:<br/><br/><b>Albraxas, Grand Apothecary of the Liver</b> (Jon)<br/>I can heal anything except my warp-mutated eyes.<br/>Though merely an apothecary, I obey only the voice of the Emperor.<br/>I carry the acrid, vinegar smell of the Lord's bowels.<br/>I drink machine oil, for my insides are rotten.<br/>I stroke my long, slimy beard incessantly.<br/>Envy: Trentnor: His blood is pure &amp; delicious.<br/>Envy: Chamfor: He sports a hat made from a wild snow tiger killed by his own hands.

Indeed, most of us ended up with Death and more than a little Warp. (In part because our rules were slightly tuned against us, with the two negative progress tracks and relatively lower "gem" earnings.) My knowledge of the WH40K canon was slightly threadbare before; it's a bit more awesome right now.<br/><br/>In between stories, we described how we furthered our heresies / moved closer to death / were driven mad by the Warp; we added in that increased Warp lead to twisting your original senses attributes, which was fun. (One of Jon's was that the Emperor's liver actually exploded, so he was thereafter in charge of its mausoleum. Grisly.)<br/><br/>Ruleswise, I think we stayed pretty close to the standard rules this time around. The key changes were:\n<ul>\n<li>Each player could have multiple characters.</li>\n<li>A lightweight combat resolution system (take turns trying to roll 5+ to kill a character; in terms of the original rules, I saw this as merely adding an optional step before resolving questions of whether a named character died).</li>\n<li>There wasn't an explicit asking of questions/what-ifs to build up "gems". Rather, if a character you represented was killed, the "body" went to either the GM or the player (depending on the odds/evens on the killing die), and those bodies were treated as "gems" in the in-between phase. In other words: the main "question" you could put down a gem for is: "This character I control; how are they gonna die?" And, indeed, you want people to kill as many characters as possible.</li>\n</ul>\nI think that's about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121714/#Comment_121714" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T11:45:34+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 11:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2008 11:46AM by Flynn.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was definitely a lot of fun.  I can't decide if I enjoyed the meta-character interactions in the council room more, or jumping between constantly dying characters in the narratives.  I profited greatly from going last in the game, as Dev, Jon, and Nathan provided some awesome examples to base my story on.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to highlight a couple of thoughts I had during and post-play:<br/>\n<br/>\n-During the meta-play (e.g. council meetings of the High lords) the stories were actually given the pre-text of anecdotes told by the narrator to convince the council of a course of action.  It worked well as context but I struggled to shape my story into something that matched the point I was trying to prove.  The random nature of death for the characters in the narrative meant that I couldn't be certain how the story would play out.  I wonder if the "pre-text" should just be discarded for the future or the course of action the narrator was pushing for only decided after the story completes (i.e. assign meaning to the story retroactively).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Something I'm divided about is whether the stories should be "History" or "Moralistic Fairy-Tale".<br/>\n<br/>\nWith history, any cast of characters or subject matter is potentially viable, but there are fewer guidelines for group agreement about what should happen (e.g. players assigned characters in the narrative may be unsure what to do).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the case of a scifi "Aesop Fable" I think it presents players with a more easily grasped concept - I think we all have almost instinctual moral sense about how such a tale usually plays out.  Add in the idea of strong archetypes (e.g. The Psycher, The Chaplain, The Blood-Angel, The Demon, The Genestealer, The Commander, The Mutant, etc), which we can play to or subvert in the tale, and it seems a convenient short-hand to get everyone playing on the same page.  But this is inherently limiting choice.  Even more damning to my theory, the play at the table didn't entirely bear this out (I think the other players struggled most for guidance during my "fairy-tale" as opposed to the more historical stories Dev, Jon, and Nathan told).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-I really want the meta-character traits to figure more significantly in the game mechanically.  We had all this cool description about these wacky characters and no way to actualize it through play.  I'm thinking that the Senses should be important when assigning narrative characters and possibly figure into how the narrative character's actions play out.  Maybe this is an inappropriate change from "1001 Nights" but it seems to me to be an untapped opportunity.  Like maybe these tales are so old that there is some disagreement on the exact events - providing the opportunity for the Senses of the meta-characters to affect the narrative characters (e.g. giving a better die roll threshold in appropriate circumstance perhaps).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, those are just my initial reactions on a single play of the game.  I definitely had fun with it in it's current form so I'm certain that radical change is not called for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122177/#Comment_122177" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T09:55:54+00:00" title="January 27, 2008  9:55AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are multiple meta-frames that could be used for this version of the game. I mean, what we were doing was a one-to-one map with stock 1001 Nights, but what if we all played military commanders and each round was reviewing Auspex data from your commands latest battle? <br/><br/>That would be cool. Then we would be basically fighting out a campaign-length series of battles, and each story is zooming in on the turning points, say, or the battles most important to each commander, and the results of each story guide the course of the campaign.<br/><br/>Or, we could play it as Orks, and be bragging about past Waaaaaaaaghs! Or Eldar, having some kind of spiritual conclave and channeling events past. Or Precog Psykers, trying to show the Imperial forces the things that are to come. The possibilities are endless!<br/><br/>The only factions I can think of that wouldn't make sense to port in are Necrons (cuz they're all machines) and maybe Tau (cuz I have no idea what their society is supposed to be like - Jon?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122186/#Comment_122186" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T10:52:54+00:00" title="January 27, 2008 10:52AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'll let Jared handle the Necron implementation.

I was also thinking recently about unit differentiation, and I was thinking that we could simplify the 40K minis rules based on the general unit organization types: HQ + Retinue, Elites, Troops, Fast Attack, Heavy Support, and Armor.  Each of those types of units could have their own slightly different rules for movement, shooting, etc., but you wouldn't have to use all the special rules for all the different types of units that exist in 40K.  I mean, if you're gonna do that, you might as well just play 40K.  In fact, HQ and Armor could just be modifiers that you place on the other types of units, so you could have HQ + Fast Attack, for a commander in a Speeder or Armor + Heavy Support for some Imperial Guard artillery tank.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122196/#Comment_122196" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T13:13:16+00:00" title="January 27, 2008  1:13PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Tau are all idealistic and for the greater good.
