It sounds really cool... There are some great AP reports out there. I think this may be next on my list.<br/><br/>A few questions I couldn't find answered:<br/>1) How many players can it hold? Is there a recommended "sweet spot" number?<br/><br/>2) How long does it typically take for a single session?<br/><br/>3) How does it play with RPG/story newbies?<br/><br/>4) How does it play with players experienced with traditional RPGs, but not with story games?<br/><br/>5) What kind of prep work (besides printing playbooks and, of course, reading the rules) is required?<br/><br/>6) Would you recommend it for a group that will primarily play one-off sessions instead of ongoing campaigns?<br/><br/>Any other insight you can share would be appreciated.

MC + 2-4 players. I am pretty sure this number appears in the book itself, too. Although others have run games with 5 or more player-characters, I think this is folly and I wonder how they manage screen-time and ensure that everyone is entangled in the same complicated relationship web(s).<br/><br/>2.) I tend to take about an hour doing character creation and set-up, and then spend 2.5-3 hours actually playing. In that time, some plots will boil up and get their climactic shining moment, whereas other plots will remain as loose threads at the end of the session. (For sessions that aren't the first, obviously there's no character creation time, and play itself runs 3-3.5 hours)<br/><br/>3.) I've had lots of luck with new players. The key is to not dump all the rules &amp; explanation on them at once. Guide them through the rules incrementally, and teach only what's needed to make solid choices at any stage of character creation or play. Be forgiving. Use examples. Be permissive.<br/><br/>4.) Some traditional players hate it. You literally play horny teenage monsters with emotional problems. There are multiple core moves that revolve around standing around feeling angsty and looking pouty. So, some people decide that the game isn't for them, before even giving it a chance. And those who give it a reluctant chance: some love it, some hate it, some are intrigued and can't figure out what they think.<br/><br/>5.) None. Watch an episode of The Vampire Diaries, watch an episode of Gossip Girl, and drudge up some lingering sensory experiences from your teenage days. That's it. Between sessions in a campaign, you may want to create Menaces, but most of the plot will emerge from the catty &amp; dysfunctional interactions of the PCs.<br/><br/>6.) Yes, if: the group tends to make quick decisions during character creation, the group tends to push hard towards dramatic climactic moments in play, and you've got the reference sheets on hand for everybody.<br/><br/>7.) A great resource that Jenskot has been creating is this set of moves reference cards: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17119/monsterhearts-cards/p1" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'd recommend printing off a set and using them to make the game feel more accessible for new players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391182/#Comment_391182" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T00:18:49+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 12:18AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played once and run once, but for what it's worth-<br/>1. 2-4 players plus MC.  Three would be the sweet spot, IMO.  When I played at Kapcon, we had about 6, which was too many- spotlight was in short supply, and we were almost two separate groups of three with not much overlap.<br/>2. As any 'typical' rpg, really.  3-4 hours would be typical from my POV.<br/>3. I've run it for people who've maybe played one or two sessions of any rpg before. It runs very well.<br/>4. The session also had experienced LARPers and storygamers, and they enjoyed it too.  There probably were some mostly 'trad' gamers in the con game, and I think all had fun.  It's very well structured game, but does need players to take initiative if it is to really sing.<br/>5. No pre-game prep, in my case, beyond what you describe.  In preparing for session two, after a long hiatus, I had to refamiliarise myself with the situation, and work up some Threats.<br/>6. We had a lot of fun at Kapcon, and the one-shot led to a lot of enthusiasm to continue the game.<br/><br/>In short, I think it's an excellent game and very well worth running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391183/#Comment_391183" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T00:20:51+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 12:20AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

I think I shall be purchasing this tonight or tomorrow.<br/><br/>One last question: Last night, while Googling various AP/session reports, I came across a "one on one" write-up (MC + exactly 1 player). It seemed like the experience went very well for the players. I know the game is supposed to be MC + 2-4 players, but has anyone else tried playing MC + 1 player? Any special concessions that need to be made for that type of game?<br/><br/>Also, if anyone is looking for players for online games of this (play by forum, Google Hangouts, Skype), please let me know!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391253/#Comment_391253" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T17:47:35+00:00" title="September 24, 2012  5:47PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I know the game is supposed to be MC + 2-4 players, but has anyone else tried playing MC + 1 player?

The Chosen is interesting because they hurt their friends, but this is less interesting if her friends are disposable NPCs. So skip including the Chosen if playing with 1 player. The Queen similarly becomes uninteresting in a 1-player game.<br/><br/>The best skins to put on the table for a 1-player game are probably: The Fae, The Ghoul, The Infernal, The Vampire, The Werewolf, The Witch, and <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/The-Serpentine.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Serpentine</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391264/#Comment_391264" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T20:41:07+00:00" title="September 24, 2012  8:41PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense.
