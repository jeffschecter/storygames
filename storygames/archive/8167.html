I'd like to bottle what I love about it and share it with others, but figuring out what exactly I love about it isn't always easy.<br/><br/>When I play other games from the same period, like Lufia 2, they don't do a thing for me.  When I play later Final Fantasy games, or similar games, same deal.  So clearly my love isn't bound up in magic systems, item management, a hundred levels, active time battles, mecha, airships, or magic-as-nature metaphors.  When I play games like Oblivion, with far more content, I don't get the same investment in the character, the guy who goes everywhere and does everything isn't nearly as interesting to me.  <br/><br/>I love multiple protagonists crossing paths in the world's most pivotal moments.  I love how those stories lead to confrontation (in the form of boss fights), but there was always something more brewing, another character whose past hadn't come to light, another evil that hadn't been vanquished.  The very best part of the game was the small cutscenes in an ancient city - hardly relevant to the main plot at all - where you got to play Raiden (in this case, a bad-ass knight) in the fall of his city a thousand years before.  Thinking about that, it hit me.<br/><br/>I wanted to play General Leo conquering three cities, or Emperor Gestahl breaching the Esper world.  I wanted to play Mage Knights in the ancient war, or the stories of individual Espers.  I wanted to play the kids at Terra's orphanage, scrabbling to protect each other from monsters.<br/><br/>So yeah, In A Wicked Age scratches a very, very old itch for me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lemon" title="lemon"><img alt="lemon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lemon">lemon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179740/#Comment_179740" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T06:55:31+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  6:55AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ignoring the non-question of what is the best game ever, I wholly agree with this post.<br/><br/>You might enjoy Eternal Darkness for the GameCube, a Lovecraftian survival horror game where you play different characters from different time periods in every chapter, or level.

That is, there is one clear Main Character who has only a very sketchy personality to act as a better avatar to the player. So much so that they don't speak, responding to the other characters only in a limited set of gestures/expressions. Most of the direction comes from the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>FF6, by contrast, has a large ensemble cast; early on in the game, Terra seems something like a Main Character, but after the end of the world, she has no greater role in the story than anyone else.<br/><br/>I feel like FF6 is a lot darker and more mature in its story too, at least if you dig under the surface dialogue. Abuse of government power in Chrono Trigger was played somewhat for laughs, but the depredations of occupying armies and war crimes figured prominently and unflinchingly in FF6. Chrono Trigger had you stop the end of the world (though you saw what would otherwise happen, hundreds of years later), but FF6 made you live through it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181091/#Comment_181091" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T15:50:42+00:00" title="December  1, 2008  3:50PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2008 3:57PM by Tulpa.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall,<br/>I liked Unlimited Saga!

Hamauza is actually a genuinely good composer and not quite as video gamey as his co composers, so a game entirely composed of his solo work makes listening to it worth playing alone. For me anyway.<br/><br/>P.P.S. I admit it's a sloppy game, but I just have a soft spot for just how interesting many of its ideas were.
