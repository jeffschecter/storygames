I'm choosing him as an example because I like him and he's tough and knows I mean well, I'm sure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I don't see how a great deal of D&amp;D play (which includes the way I play D&amp;D, by the way) fits with the definition.  Indeed much D&amp;D play is largely indistinguishable from many types of board/card games.  In fact there are card games (such as Dungeoneer) that try to replicate the experience in a more streamlined manner.<br/></blockquote>\nI've seen several comments like this, and every time, I scratch my head and think, "What the fuck are these people talking about?" I particularly think this in regards to older editions of D&amp;D. D&amp;D 4E, ok, I can buy this, even if I think it's kind of ridiculous. 4E has a reasonably good tactical combat engine that could power a board game inside of it, and if you want to play it that way, go ahead. But classic D&amp;D? Really?<br/><br/>Here's the case. First, it would be shitty as a card or board game. There's barely any rules, no real constraints, and no way to objectively judge what's going on in the game.<br/><br/>Next, how can it not be about ethical choices? (Note to lurkers wanting to say I hate D&amp;D or something: I love D&amp;D more than you do.) The whole game is choices. Do I take the left tunnel or the right? I want treasure badly, but I know there's something down there that might kill me, and might kill my friends. How much do I prepare for that? Can I outsmart it? What should I do with this artifact? Should I stab these slavers in the face?<br/><br/>I'll grant you that the answers are often obvious. Who isn't going to stab these slavers in the face, right? But they are questions involving your survival and the survival of others, questions with real consequences. When you're third level with 9 hit points, there's a big consequence to going down into the dungeon hole.<br/><br/>So, I'm actually interested and don't want to totally make fun of others, so let me know: how are you playing this game that it's not about ethical choices? I can't figure out how that would work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227304/#Comment_227304" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T14:13:43+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  2:13PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>how are you playing this game that it's not about ethical choices?

Regardless of which side you come down on...that seems pretty indisputably ethical to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your second example the ethical issue is "why are trying to inflict massive amounts of damage on other living creatures in the first place."  Or potentially, "given that both spells have an area of effect component, what is so important that you're willing to risk collateral damage to friends or innocents to cast that spell in this environment".<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because there may not be a player in the world who has those thoughts before casting the spell doesn't mean they aren't making an ethical decision.  It just means they're ignoring the ethical decision in favor of the tactical / greed motivation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;some District 9 Spoilers&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo return to my District 9 as an RPG kick:  I think there are few people who weren't squirming at least a little bit by the MNU roasting the alien eggs nursery and describing their destruction as popping like popcorn.  Clearly that is presented as a tactically optimized even necessary decision (population control) of "questionable" ethics in the movie.  Its also the sort of thing that happens all the time in classic RPGs.  How is it any less of an ethical quandary when we describe ourselves doing it in a game context vs. when we watch others do it in a movie context.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my take anyway.  Approaching the taking of life from an entirely amoral stance and justifying it as "just a game" is itself an exploration of ethics...whether the people doing so are aware of it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit to add:  Paul, IMO players don't get to duck the ethical questions of their actions in a game just by claiming they "don't give a shit about the fictional situation".  Note:  I'm NOT NOT NOT saying those people are evil bastards engaging in badwrongfun.  I'm saying you can't escape the essential ethical question just by choosing not to engage with it.  The question is there and its being answered by your actions whether you choose to acknowledge it or not.  I'm also saying that choosing to not acknowledge it is itself and interesting ethical question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227334/#Comment_227334" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T14:48:50+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  2:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Paul, and explain how it can be not about the ethical questions, while it can't.<br><br>The narrative addresses an ethical question.

We had to figure out how the game worked in isolation from the rest of "gamer" culture.  Overtime we graduated to AD&amp;D 1st Ed.  My mother really, really enjoyed making maps and populating them with all kinds of details.  Basically, she was a video game level designer slightly ahead of her time.<br><br>When we showed up to play there always some guy waiting to pay us to go do something or other for him.  One of my absolute favorites was a guy who inherited a house from his crazy ex-thief uncle who rigged the place with traps and monsters.  The guy only got to keep his fortune if he could actually find all of it hidden in the house in under 48 hours.  So he hired us to do it for him.<br><br>We literally had to keep track of every six square we moved because that cost us "6 seconds of time" (the length of a first edition D&amp;D round).  We had to account for every copper piece of treasure.  Every search check mattered.  I remember the final room of the house was completely empty except for a chest.  In the chest we actually found a large bulk of the fortune.  We were about to leave when my little 12 year old brain had a thought.  I said, "I push the chest, aside and search UNDER it."  Sure enough I found a loose brick.  And UNDER that loose brick I found ONE copper piece.  We then booked it to the exit counting every square on the map as we went.  We got out with something like 5 *rounds* to spare.<br><br>Given everything we did in that adventure there's no reason you couldn't package the whole thing up and sell it as a board game.  "Crazy Old McPhere's WILL"  Can you locate your uncle's inheritance before time runs out?  Search for traps!  Fight Monsters!  But watch the clock and count your pennies.  Miss a single coin and it's GAME OVER.

"Orc" in some applications of D&amp;D has no ethical value.  It might as well be called monster type <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23212&amp;Mode=like">#212</a>.  The aliens in District 9 have ethical value because of the narrative context in which they are presented.  Orcs in my D&amp;D games have not ethical value because I deliberately setup ethically void situations when running D&amp;D.  "Orc" is just a label for that red dot on the game board that 5's squares away from you and needs to have 10 points of damage done to it before it does 5 points of damage to you or you lose.  Does it matter if you call Green Land in Magic: The Gathering, Swamp or Grasslands?

It's assumed you want treasure and you are willing to go down into a dungeon, kill things and take their stuff.  When playing D&amp;D; in that fashion we question whether you get the treasure, how much you get, what you do to get it but we dont question why you want it or whether going into the dungeon and killing things is a moral act.<br/>\nThis may have ethical implications as Ralph points out when we look at it from the outside but if it's not being questioned in play it's not an ethical question for the character.

A group deciding, together, to play a game in which you kill everything and take their stuff without anyone ever considering the implications of such things if they really happened in a really real world is an ethical decision. Afterwards, while playing the game, killing something and taking its stuff without ever considering the implications of such an act if it happened in a really real world is not. Maybe it points back at the original ethical decision, but at that point it has nothing to do with ethics. And if there never was an original decision, then the in-the-moment killing can have ethical overtones if a) the group is answering the original question as "yes, we want to consider implications", or b) the killing <i>helps answer</i> the original question. But if the question's been answered (such as when playing <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=227164" rel="nofollow">Descent the Board Game</a>), then each individual killing decision has no ethical overtones.

One might say that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ComYu6OiUp4" rel="nofollow">Bugsy &amp; Mugsy's</a> moral statement is "It's okay to get jewelry robbers to try to kill each other with an axe, and blow them up with dynamite."  Maybe it is, but the moral statement is not the point of the show and it's misleading to describe it that way. <br/><br/>The role of violence in fiction in general is a very interesting subject, but it's a lot broader than just "I portray this violence, thus I am permissive of it or claim it is legitimate". The fact that the violence is not in fact happening is crucial to talking about the subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227379/#Comment_227379" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T18:48:40+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  6:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Funny, I actually had the opposite thought.

I must say, first, that I had a sort of culture shock learning (by other accounts) that in the USA there is a big percentage of people who play that way. Even in the "good old days" that was considered badwrong play (it was called "pawn pushing"), often by the exact same people who during play killed bystanders saying "well, they are only NPC..."). Today I think I am less prone to onetruewayism but I think that there is something cultural in this different approach to tole-playing...  <br/><br/>Anyway, I wanted to ask if it was conceivable, during the game, letting a character die to get his share of the treasure.

Let me get back to Clinton's original post.<br/><br/>When I was eight years old my mother bought Red Box D&amp;D from Toys R. Us.  We had to figure out how the game worked in isolation from the rest of "gamer" culture.  Overtime we graduated to AD&amp;D 1st Ed.  My mother really, really enjoyed making maps and populating them with all kinds of details.  Basically, she was a video game level designer slightly ahead of her time.<br/><br/>When we showed up to play there always some guy waiting to pay us to go do something or other for him.  One of my absolute favorites was a guy who inherited a house from his crazy ex-thief uncle who rigged the place with traps and monsters.  The guy only got to keep his fortune if he could actually find all of it hidden in the house in under 48 hours.  So he hired us to do it for him.<br/><br/>We literally had to keep track of every six square we moved because that cost us "6 seconds of time" (the length of a first edition D&amp;D round).  We had to account for every copper piece of treasure.  Every search check mattered.  I remember the final room of the house was completely empty except for a chest.  In the chest we actually found a large bulk of the fortune.  We were about to leave when my little 12 year old brain had a thought.  I said, "I push the chest, aside and search UNDER it."  Sure enough I found a loose brick.  And UNDER that loose brick I found ONE copper piece.  We then booked it to the exit counting every square on the map as we went.  We got out with something like 5 *rounds* to spare.<br/><br/>Given everything we did in that adventure there's no reason you couldn't package the whole thing up and sell it as a board game.  "Crazy Old McPhere's WILL"  Can you locate your uncle's inheritance before time runs out?  Search for traps!  Fight Monsters!  But watch the clock and count your pennies.  Miss a single coin and it's GAME OVER.  The exciting new board game from Parker Brothers.<br/><br/>Jesse</blockquote>\nDammnnn! That sounds awesome. I normally hated all the book keeping with AD&amp;D, and houseruled most of it out (well not really houseruled, we just ignored a lot of things), but I would totally be down for it with that kind of adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227383/#Comment_227383" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T19:17:03+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Next, how can it not be about ethical choices? </blockquote>\nMost of my experience with early D&amp;D play wasn't about ethical choices, it was about survival.  Raw efficient survival.  <br/><br/>See, we came to the game seeing a guy taking on a dragon on the cover, but after spending time calculating encumberance and noting down saving throws to have 90% of the party die from a carrion crawler and a few rats, suddenly the game wasn't about being heroic.  The game was simply a) not dying and b) getting gold to level up to get to a point when you didn't have to worry about dying from rats.<br/><br/>Of course, it didn't help that a lot of the modules were sprinkled with senseless death traps and ubermonsters among the other ones- which meant that play then was about paranoia as a means to survival.<br/><br/>"Moral choices" only came up when I played with groups who had parties with open alignment options, which then devolved into "How do you have a functional group when some people think it's ok to steal and kill the others?" (answer: you don't).<br/><br/>But let's step back a little further- the key point you're resting on is choices.  Real, meaningful choices.  Had I been introduced to Moldvay Red Box instead of the other Red Box, I'd have seen a section which explicitly tells the DM to take fictional choices and create rolls/mechanics on the fly taking plausibility choices as priority above the mechanics presented ("I throw the curtain over it's head!" "OK, it's blinded and can't use it's ray against you" vs. "Roll vs. Death - oops you're dead").<br/><br/>The fact is, many editions of D&amp;D simply said, "make up rules" but didn't put in the instructions that the DM was supposed to put fictional choices as the priority in doing so.  Which, you know is, basically what makes rpgs completely different than every other type of game people are used to.<br/><br/>So yeah, I imagine without that, there's not much room for choice, and by extension, it narrows it to a survival game against the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227388/#Comment_227388" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T19:29:51+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:29PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I guess I don't get it.<br/><br/>There are several posters on this thread talking about value-neutral roleplaying -- pushing pawns, whatever.<br/><br/>And there are several posters saying it's simply impossible to roleplay this way. Ralph, I guess I'm putting you on the spot here. Your position sounds a bit like the folks tut-tutting fans of the board game Puerto Rico (to bring my example back up from earlier) for not recognizing that the little brown chits they're pushing around represent slaves ... sometimes with the implication that, by playing Puerto Rico, you're somehow condoning slavery. I mean, is that true? The game establishes a situation (you run plantations and make money by deploying slaves into your fields) but at no point does it feel like ethics ever enters into the equation. The goal is to win via Victory Points, therefore your only play motivation is to achieve as many Victory Points as possible.<br/><br/>And, again, I'm confused by the notion that even when roleplayers are motivated by nothing other than mechanical inducements (particularly when they perceive no dimension to their play beyond mechanical inducements), they're <i>still</i> somehow engaged in ethical play.<br/><br/>Is ethics-neutral game play of any sort ever possible? Do you have to revert to the most abstract pattern-recognition games to get there? Even Chess is "about" war and Go is "about" land acquisition. (Or something....I know Go is "about" something.)<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227391/#Comment_227391" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T19:40:06+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This suddenly came to me and I think it explains how a lot of what's being said is going by each other and not really connecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's take the district 9 example and specifically the scene where Wikus finds the Prawn egg sacs and gleefully burns them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Wikus as the character this isnt an ethical question.

They're definitely possible, but not required.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227460/#Comment_227460" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T04:54:37+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  4:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 5:19AM by James_Nostack.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanna make sure we're talking about the same thing., Luke, Clinton and those guys are positing a definition of Ethics: people interacting with their environment = Situation, right?  If you accept the definition, the relationship between ethics and RPG's is tautological because Situation is a required element of RPG's.  People may not accept the definition of ethics, but that's a horribly tedious discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd part of the hang-up is that "ethical choices" != "ethical dilemmas" ?<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited to add some content: It's not that choosing to turn Right or Left in the dungeon is an ethical choice in itself.  It's that it becomes so based on what we already know of the dungeon/our prior imaginings.  Why turn Right or Left at all, when there's all this wonderful loot for the taking back at the Keep on the Borderlands if we're just devious enough to recover it?  The act of role-playing invests even the most trivial Situation with some degree of ethical (in this particular sense) dimension.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Classic D&amp;D; simply cannot avoid this because, as Clinton says, there simply isn't much <i>game</i> there.  The system is practically freeform and the setting (rooms and caves underground, populated by weird things) is so abstract that the players have to imagine a broader context to do any role-playing at all.  And once you've got that broader context, WHAMMO, an ethic exists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227464/#Comment_227464" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T05:20:15+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  5:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still think you're mistaking dilema for question Jarvis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your first example you indicate that the audience injects ethics into a situation that the participants hadn't intended to be there.  Ummm, right.  Ethics is highly influenced by cultural and subcultural mores.  So people from different backgrounds are quite likely to notice different ethical issues.  That supports my point not disproves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for gelatinous cubes, why drill down to such a narrow slice of play.  Your fighter was also breathing while they were in the dungeon...is that an ethical choice?  Better to scale your question up.  Why was your fighter in the dungeon to begin with?  If the fighter knows the cube isn't evil, why choose to kill it rather than avoid it?  These are all questions where one can analyse the ethics of the fighter's decisions.  Whether or not the fighter analyses them is immaterial.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the real world a professional claiming they had no doubt that their choice was right or that they "didn't really have a choice" isn't going to help them much when they're dragged in front of the ethical review board.  Again, the fact that you were unaware of the ethical issue at stake, or were aware but chose not to engage in it, is completely irrelevant to the binary condition of was there an ethical issue or wasn't there.  And that will be primarily decided for you by others.  And different others will often reach different conclusions about what the issue was.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut too much electronic ink has been spent on this topic anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227474/#Comment_227474" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T06:06:41+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  6:06AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>But too much electronic ink has been spent on this topic anyway.</blockquote>\nThat's where you're wrong, Ralph.

There's a huge point to collecting XP. XP leads to characters increasing in power.  Which leads to being able to have more tactical options during play. And it also purposefully leads to facing more difficult tactical opposition, and thus increases the variety in play. Gathering XP is like slowly taking the training wheels off your bike, or slowly earning back your handicapping stones in Go. Without gathering of XP, the group would be playing 1st level characters for a very long time: there is opportunity for variety in play there, as well, and honing of tactical skills, but not much in the way of leading to facing more difficult opposition because at some point the opposition becomes powerful enough that your group of 1st level characters have little hope of survival.<br><br>PC survival and gathering of XP after a session can represent a "win", but not all games have a zero-sum win as their ending (or pausing) condition.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
