Freaking amazing. I loved the rulebook, but the actual gameplay was more meaningful and evocative than I had expected. I'm really, really impressed. We played with four people, and the map ended up being really interesting and complex.<br/><br/>I have a few questions, though:<br/><br/>1) Has anyone played with a different number than four people? Does it work well with five or six? How does it play with just two?<br/><br/>2) One of our players started a project every time he could, effectively trying to end scarcities at all times. How can we encourage people to diversify the game experience? Is it even necessary to do that?<br/><br/>3) Do people introduce a lot of individual characters? At the end of the game, I think we only had like 3-4, and I introduced most of them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405380/#Comment_405380" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T11:22:35+00:00" title="February  4, 2013 11:22AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) I played with three people and it worked well, so far as I could see.<br/><br/>2) I'm not sure if it's necessary - there are many paths through the game.<br/><br/>3) We had a tonne of different characters by the end, many of whom faded into the background after their introduction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405381/#Comment_405381" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T11:24:14+00:00" title="February  4, 2013 11:24AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.) I've played with 2, 3, 4, and 5. For me, the two-player game feels really personal. There's space to learn what the player sitting opposite you really cares about and wants in a community. Playing with three or four feels similar to me: moments of discovery and surprise, factions slowly emerging, truces hard-won, a map full of weird ideas. Playing with five feels unfocused to me, with too much downtime. That's why I list the game as 2-4 players: because I find 5-6 boring at the table.<br/><br/>2.) I think the second question you ask here is the important one: is it even necessary to worry about this? If it didn't hamper your experience, then don't worry about it. If it felt like a flat note and a detraction, then the easiest way is to pause the game and say, "Hey, I notice you're only starting projects. That's an okay thing to do, but remember that this isn't a puzzle to solve, it's a community to explore" Or pause and re-read a section of the rules that seems relevant (like the part on domesticating the situation).<br/><br/>3.) Usually I see 8-12 named characters by the end, and 3-4 tend to have developed personalities and represent larger trends/factions in the community. Your game sounds like it definitely sat on the low-end of characterization, but that's also totally fine. Did you find yourself wishing for more humanization/personalization? Did issues that the community faced lack traction? Named characters primarily serve to make the community's issues seem more real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405398/#Comment_405398" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T13:02:19+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  1:02PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.<br/>It plays great with three.<br/><br/>I've played with six, and followed Mcdaldno's advice in a previous thread: taught them all the rules at the start, and then split into two groups of three players. At the end of summer, we swapped a player between the groups and had them take a faction of their community with them over to the other group.<br/><br/>2.<br/>I think it's possible and reasonable to 'play to win' with the Quiet Year - to try and get the best outcome for your community. I've certainly had a community hit 'win' - in that I've felt they've done as much as possible to prepare for the coming of winter and the Frost Shepherds as they could. Starting projects to end scarcities seems like a reasonable response.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want to play like that all the time - I think I prefer exploring a different facet of how communities work in each game I play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405404/#Comment_405404" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T14:18:29+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  2:18PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the guy is skilled enough to consistently introduce projects that don't cause problems despite the pressures of the cards, good on him, that's what scarcities seem to be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405409/#Comment_405409" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T15:46:27+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  3:46PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I prefer not to name characters, beyond what the cards demand -- usually they will produce 4-6 people who could potentially be named.
