Several times for RPG virgins. Its such an easy game to run for people who haven't role played before because they get it straight away and are off; whereas old-hands can be confused by the fact that it doesn't work the way they have come to expect and look like they are waiting for more framework to make it a respectable game that it's valid to play and without which we are all just making stuff up.<br/><br/>But conversely I have found that the experienced players cooperatively restrain themselves so that they don't describe things that jar with the other peoples expectations - they sort of play within a genre. Whereas the new players (who were younger - but not all <i>that</i> young) seemed unrestrained and uncooperative to the extent that I struggled to maintain suspension of disbelief because their approaches jarred to the extent that characters and events seemed to come from a different style stories. Imagine two authors mixing say The Crow with Daffy Duck in the same story with no effort to establish a shared level of reality.<br/><br/>The Pool is very much a game without built in boundaries. In traditional games the GM enforces boundaries by vetoing actions. In The Pool the GMs job is not to stomp on the players ideas. For good reason the GM lacks powers to veto actions or narration - even on the grounds that they are inappropriate for the setting or style of presentation. The experienced players seemed to know that boundaries made for satisfying consistency, so they respected them even though they were not enforced by the rules.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span><br/><br/>Is that other peoples experience: Experienced players may struggle with the lack of rules but they have a (perhaps unconscious) understanding that you find a common flavour of play and all play to it. And that its not immediately obvious to new players that you need to do this or how its done.<br/><br/>What should the GM do to try to encourage a group to arrive at a consensus on the style of play and then respect its boundaries?<br/><br/>How can this be done without boring new players who just want to leap in and play and for who the game is just fun not a hobby to be dissected or analysed?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81733/#Comment_81733" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:12:28+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:12AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Play more with them.</p>\n<p>I don't mean this to dismiss your question!

"You're disagreeing here because you aren't looking to get the same things from playing. Is there an agreement that'll make both of you happy?" You do this about five times and people will start to anticipate that question when problems come up in the future, and be prepared for it; you do it about 25 times, and people will start asking the question before the game starts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81745/#Comment_81745" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:31:16+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:31AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like The Pool.  It's an often overlooked and underrated little system.  Here's how I approached things with my group.<br/><br/>1) I basically came to the group with a style sheet.  I had an idea for a religious themed superhero setting called Eden Falls.  Originally I conceived of it as X-Men with the tone of Batman and religious issues instead of prejudice/political issues.  In practice it turned out to be bit more like a Sandman by way of Raymond Chandler tribute but that's okay.  It was a lot of fun.  But the main point was that as the GM I came to the table with a preformed setting idea expressed in about a single page of largely atmospheric notes.<br/><br/>2) I made it clear that Monologues of Victory did not have to be paragraphs of purple prose with massive story altering effects.  In practice, most people used Monologues of Victory to insure certain details were established in the outcome of conflicts.  For example players would use a Monologue of Victory to ensure that during a fight sequence no by standers were hurt, or that the villain was disarmed or in an argument that it was clear that failure resulted in the losers public embarrassment and so forth.<br/><br/>3) I strictly enforced the notion that die failure = character failure and not simply which side of the table decides success or failure.  Then I made sure that ALL fictional conflicts were resolved via a die roll.<br/><br/>We played two story arcs in this setting.  The first was a straight up supernaturally charged murder mystery/crime drama.  The second was a political battle between not only the people of Eden Falls but the among the Gods themselves.  L.A. Confidential meets Greek Myth.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickHollingsworth" title="NickHollingsworth"><img alt="NickHollingsworth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/nKFHDCZ1ID18X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickHollingsworth">NickHollingsworth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81747/#Comment_81747" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:37:06+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:37AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps as you imply its a matter of youth rather than rpg experience.

When we played it, as a group who were relatively new to each other, everyone stuck to the genre laid out in my one sheet. But many months later, when we playtested a game of my own design that gives players similar open narrative power, we'd gone na[rra]tive and had lost our good gamer manners of suspending our interests to the GM's authorial mojo, and so the game went a bit genre incoherent.<br/><br/>In a subsequent conversation with Ron, we arrived at shared language for describing the issue: <em>you can't teach genre through play</em>.<br/><br/>Well...screw that. Here's a snip of design marginalia from the <em>Acts of Evil</em> ashcan, about an as-yet-not-playtested mechanic called Concomitance that I'm hoping solves this problem:\n<ul>One of the great unsolved challenges of RPG design is how to teach a game's genre in play to players who aren't familiar with its inspirations. This problem plagues Acts of Evil. The occultist characters are increasingly cosmic-scale villains in a discontinuous narrative. Their scenes should thrill and shock us with cinematic special effects. But players who haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t seen Hellraiser, Hellboy, or similar films, always seem to get themselves trapped in small, squalid scenes.<br/><br/>Concomitance is built on my thinking that a collective understanding of genre will develop from a structure of giving and taking suggestions...[snip]</ul>\nWe shall see.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
