Four people have taken refuge from the zombie apocalypse in a shopping mall. This game <i>(Mall of the Dead</i> is one of the scenarios in <i>Mall Jongg</i>) is played with Mah Jongg tiles.<br/><br/>In addition to skills, there are four scores: Hope, Atrocity, Escape, and Doom. These go up (never down) based on the things that you do, and the things which are done to you. They tell you how the game will end.<br/><br/>Roger, the Bastard, is a loan agent a lot of money and very little empathy. As he's coming down the escalator from a supply run, he sees a throng of zombies heading towards him. One of the security guards, who isn't part of the group, but who's been kind to them, tries to help. Roger pulls a "Backstab Time" and leaves the man to die, using his agonizing death to cover his own escape. He doesn't tell the others about this, or about the extra food that he squirreled away (only bringing some of the canned goods to them).<br/><br/>Adam, the Scientist, is trying to restore order -- first, they need to see how many of the infected there are, so he's trying to get the lights on. Using the "My Hypothesis" skill, he manages to get the power up and running.<br/><br/>Dex, the Survivor, was a down-on-his-luck soldier with a bad mortgage before the outbreak. Now, he's trying to avoid the infected, like everyone else. He's taken refuge in a shopping mall with Roger (the Bastard), a self-centered loan agent that talked Dex into signing the papers that ruined his life. Roger doesn't give a damn about Dex or his problems. Roger will kill a basket of puppies to save his own hide, and Dex doesn't care for people like that.<br/><br/>Bif, the Honcho, is a former quarterback who think he's the team leader, and refuses to listen to reason. His pal, Adam (the Scientist), is trying to find Bella. Bella is Adam's sister, and Bif's girlfriend. And she's infected.<br/><br/>They don't know this, at first. They scour the mall, looking for her -- the group got split up when they were attacked by a bunch of zombies, and no one's seen Bella since.<br/><br/>The gang's taken refuge in a Spencer's, and they're searching the Thalhimer for supplies, clothing, anything they can find.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/mall-cover.jpg"/><br/><br/><b>The fight</b><br/><br/>Adam manages to get the power on, but the noise attracts commotion. A lot of it. A group of zombies swarms them. Bella is one of the infected.<br/><br/>Bif doesn't want to kill her -- "She can be cured!" he bellows.<br/><br/>Dex won't hear of it. She's infected, she has to die, so he tries to bust her skull open with a length of rebar.<br/><br/>Big moment: Bif fights Dex.<br/><br/>Bif's player puts down a Mah Jongg tile and describes trying to push Dex away. Dex's player puts a Mah Jongg tile face-down and describes trying to get past Bif. They both flip their tiles over. They both have played the number 9. We try again.<br/><br/>Bif puts down a tile. He's got Dex in a bear hug. Dex puts down a tile. He says he's going to start swinging wild. They both flip their tiles over. They both have 9s. This is insane.<br/><br/>It then happens again. Another pair of 9s. (There are now six 9s on the table, out of the twelve that come with a Mah Jongg game). The fight continues -- Dex is trying to smash Bella's face in, Bif keeps trying to stop him. Dex doesn't want to hurt his friend, but if Bella gets any closer, one of them is going to get bitten. Bif is screaming that please, they've lost enough people, she doesn't have to die, they can get her to the CDC.<br/><br/>In the fifth round, the both play their highest tiles as Bif tries to yank the length of rebar out of Dex's hands -- but he plays a 6, and Dex plays a 7, and that means Dex wins. The player narrates: Dex swings hard at Bella, misses, and cracks Bif right in the face. Bif goes down, blood all over his face.<br/><br/><b>The freakout</b><br/><br/>Roger (the Bastard) is backing away from the carnage, when a zombie reaches through the barricade and sinks its claws into his shoulder. He tries to wriggle free, but can't. <br/><br/>Earlier, in an Opportunity scene, he'd picked up a bunch of canned goods at the Chinese restaurant in the food court -- where he also grabbed a large kitchen knife. He uses the knife now to carve away part of his shoulder, escaping the zombie (and the horde that are now heading towards the Spencer's gifts).<br/><br/>Wounded, but relentless, Roger pushes through the door at the back of the store and makes his way into the maintenance corridor.<br/><br/>Roger picks up the unconscious Bif and tries them both away from Bella. At the front of the store, the zombies have knocked over the barricade and stormed the Spencer's Gifts. Rubik's Cubes and pet rocks and lava lamps roll across the carpeted floor as they shuffle towards the group. And Bella's still in close range. Roger tries to keep her away with that rebar, but she's getting closer. Roger panics and the player opts to use "Disaster/Betrayal" -- which means that something dreadful happens to another player. In this case, it's the unconscious Bif. Bella lunges at them, and she draws blood. At the pain, Bif regains consciousness, and finds blood all over his lower back. He's been scratched, or possibly bitten -- in the chaos, no one knows.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/malltable.jpg"/><br/><br/><b>The evacuation</b><br/><br/>Adam hits "Panic Button," meaning that he uses the adrenaline from his freakout to do something heroic. He helps Bif and Dex get to safety. Bella lurches after them, and she's not alone.<br/><br/>With dozens of zombies shambling inexorably behind them, Adam and Bif and Dex follow Roger into the corridors. There, they discover two things: there's an open delivery door at the loading dock; and something got inside -- a new breed of infected, one that's fast-moving and aggressive.<br/><br/>Roger tries to attack, but suffer a horrible injury to his eye. The zombie goes after him. Adam and Dex sprint past. Bif, still screaming about the woman he loved, staggers along after them.<br/><br/>Roger picks up a fire extinguisher and bludgeons the zombie to death.<br/><br/>My kitchen timer goes off. That means it's over. Time to see what happened.<br/><br/><b>The end credits</b><br/><br/>Kate tells us that Adam's high score was Hope -- he managed to get out the maintenance door, where he found a parked truck. He climbed in, revved up the engine, and got out of that hellish place. It wasn't much of a life out there in the world, but Adam continued to try to make his way, avoiding the infected and helping other people.<br/><br/>Roger, Matt's character, had a high Atrocity score. Matt explained that at one point, earlier in the game, when he'd been exposed to someone else's blood, he'd worried about contracting the infection -- but that wasn't the case. Instead, he contracted syphilis. As the months passed, he survived on his own, hiding in basements, going out for quick supply runs, always paranoid -- as his body became covered in lesions and his lymph nodes swelled.<br/><br/>Mason says that Bif's high score was Doom. He tried to catch up to the others, but his muscles wouldn't cooperate. Looking at his hands, he saw that they were covered with lesions, the blood in his veins darkening from some hideous infection. As he stood there, eyes slowly blackening from burst blood vessels, Bella shuffled around the corner. Bif, now one the infected, wraps his arms around Bella as his humanity leaves him.<br/><br/>Kerra's character, Dex, has a high Escape score, so she tells us that though nothing terrible happens to Dex, there's no hope in his future. He rides off with Adam, but eventually goes solo, always moving from place to place, surviving without actually living, living day to day without any illusions about what the future holds.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396053/#Comment_396053" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T10:10:53+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 10:10AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WHEN IS THIS GOING ON SALE?!?<br/>Kelley has been wanting a copy since Nerdly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396066/#Comment_396066" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T11:40:52+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 11:40AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that was the last playtest, and it went smooth like butter, so I'm going to release the external playtest in a few days, and we'll see how it works when it's out there in the world.

Mah Jongg playing cards are under ten dollars on Amazon. And there are rules for using traditional playing cards, if you want to take that approach.<br/><br/>But the thing is, the game's already more or less finished. The rules are written in outline form, and I need to type them up and release the playtest doc. The cover art's done, the interior art (which is so fun!) has been finished. So I'm not sure what the Kickstarter would be for. I mean, the print version will be at Lulu, and maybe Amazon, so no need to cover printing costs. In all likelihood, I'll just playtest this over the winter, and release it next year when it's ready.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396192/#Comment_396192" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T11:03:37+00:00" title="November  4, 2012 11:03AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I didn't meant to sound so negative.
