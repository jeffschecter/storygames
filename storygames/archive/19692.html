Unfortunately, the following is the only article about the game that we've translated so far! Still, i love talking about the game! In the coming weeks I will translate more articles to give you some more preview, but keep in mind that we started translation just a week ago... I can't ask the translator to help me with reviews and such because the translation of the handbook at this stage is more important and my english is not that good! <br/><br/><b>I'm trying my best, but I'm mostly using google translate! XD</b><br/><br/>Anyway, on with some info about the game:<br/><b>The dark menace is definitely one of the focal points!</b> In the manual you will find a lot of images of Dark menaces (e.g. a dragon) and after reading the game you'll probably see them with different, more vigilant eyes.<br/><br/>One of the special features of this game is that the system is made so that: "even the GM doesn't know exactly what is happening!". It 's something that you'll discover going through the game together. Being GM in \u201cMy fantasy\u201d is very different from both DW or D&amp;D, and extremely fun (I think I'll post the chapters that explain the GM and players roles shortly, since it's the first chapter of the game)!<br/><br/><b>Second relevant point, My fantasy is different from other Fantasy games as it is focused primarily on Mysteries and strong Choices.</b> The characters are indeed very strong Heroes and you may find yourself facing a dragon, but you'll also have to face your feelings! The characters that you are going to create are mostly a collection of bonds with their Past and Present and you'll be making tough choices through them all the time!<br/>Imagine that you are sitting comfortably in a chair in front of a house, you hear a loud noise coming from the mountains! A friend come to you and warns you with a nervous voice: "Have you noticed how the birds are flying away? Something awful must be happening!" you'll soon be forced to depart and investigate! You are the only ones who can take care of your village (the others just seem not to care and don't believe your stories).<br/><br/>But what will you leave behind? \u201cI leave my wife, my son John, but also the peace of an afternoon spent watching the mountains in the chill air under the porch". These are all Bonds to the past and are one of the most important resources in the game. Of course you'll also have reasons to push you forward. In this case the first will probably be that \u201cyou'd never leave your best friend alone in the investigation\u201d and another might be \u201cthe need of someone facing the danger!\u201d<br/>During the course of your adventure you're likely to risk death and as a result you may never see your wife and son again! This happens mechanically using your Bonds to the past and present to improve your chances of success in performing difficult actions, but then in the "recovery" scenes you'll be forced to bring into play your fears pushing you to keep choosing wether to continue and to move forward in your travel or to return home!<br/><br/><b>Third revelant point</b>, after the game setup there'll be no stop, since every scene holds a mechanical weight, also the rest around the fire and the journey by cart from one location to another (recovery scenes). During these scenes the characters explore themselves, find new motivation to keep going on with their adventure and sometimes choose to go back! In this game you wont be able to throw yourself at the huge monster without fear of losing something and the choice of returning home means you'll only be able to save one of your bonds... tough choice, isn't it?<br/><br/><b>Forth revelant point</b>, another interesting mechanic is the "heroic act": you may choose to sacrifice yourself to save your friends, getting a big bonus but going out of the game for a scene after using that advantage! This is intriguing because from heroism will come, as you may realize, the danger of dying and losing something that you love: your bonds! In the final scene when you'll be facing the menace itself, the same mechanic might let you save the world! But this time the price to pay will be death! What will you and your companions do? Returning home victorious is never a big party when you've lost some traveling companion! The game will often push you to make this kind of choices.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>My fantasy is also pretty versatile:</b> it's indeed focused on Fantasy, but you'll soon realize that it's easy to play with many other types of settings (main ispiration is Mass Effect)! It's one of those games where you'll say: "Tonight we play at my fantasy!\u201d And you wont have to prepare anything beforehand. Concerning the mechanics they are archetypes and bonds... The resolution system is based on pools of d6s, and will help you to put in game your archetype and sentimental bonds with the past and the present. This game is definitely immediate!<br/><br/><i>I've played \u201cmy fantasy\u201d with all kind of audiences, also with a group of children aged around 8 years, without any problem: we played in the world of "Epic-Secret world". Honestly, I didn't think it would have worked that well, as i thought it was playable only by adults, instead I gladly changed my mind! Obviously the issues were different but it was a really pleasant experience! I love playing with kids, even it it's difficult to keep their attention for long (I also developed games for this specific target audience as Cartooner, also in english, or Furball RPG). I think the novelty and Mistery contribute much and learning the mechanics went without problems, as they learnt quickly and effectively to apply them.</i><br/><br/>Just yesterday I finished a game in a beautiful Fantasy-Steampunk setting. The two heroes have chosen to return home, because one of the two (Emily) had hidden the other that she was pregnant with his son! When he found out, the two have chosen to save themselves! Emily saved her son but he lost his family! Jonas, the other hero and husband of Emily, saved his family but lost his best friend and his home.<br/><br/>The ending might be sad, but there's always the possibility to continue the saga... The game is not designed to play campaigns, but leaves open the opportunity to continue with the children of the protagonists of the last campaign or with the same protagonists now aged.<br/><br/>I still get goose bumps when reading the actual plays from which some of these examples are extracted, and every other session we played have left an incredible memory. You can read the AP i've uploaded yesterday, with google translate, if you like:<br/><a href="http://quanteidee.blogspot.it/2014/08/il-mio-fantasy-quando-laffetto-supera.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://quanteidee.blogspot.it/2014/08/il-mio-fantasy-quando-laffetto-supera.html</a><br/><br/>I hope to be able to give you some more information soon!<br/><br/>Thanks again for the interest!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437658/#Comment_437658" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-23T09:59:14+00:00" title="August 23, 2014  9:59AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I updated the last post (now i think is more readable)!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438055/#Comment_438055" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-02T09:06:12+00:00" title="September  2, 2014  9:06AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2014 3:06PM by vasquas.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1 - Introduction<br/>A hidden menace awakens!<br/>You recognized the signs. A glacial grip around your heart. An echo of cries so dreadful they make the mountains shiver! You glimpsed its gruesome figure in the darkness, where even light gives way to ice and obscurity. Suddenly, everything is clear to you: No one is safe anymore, and no one believes you.<br/>But as you began to doubt yourself, you felt a call in your heart. You are heroes, the only hope for a world about to face its greatest foe. When the last hour comes, you know you cannot stand by and watch.<br/>Draw your swords and lace your boots, Heroes.  Your journey begins now. Before you, the opponent. Behind you, your loved ones, your land, and your home. Will you have the courage to reach the end without turning back?<br/><br/><br/>My Fantasy is a role-playing game of tough choices, heroism, exploration and grand battles. An epic adventure for three to five players. One player will have the special role of Game Master (GM).<br/><br/>1.1 The dice<br/>To play My Fantasy you need at least twenty six-sided dice of one color and at least three of another color or different size.<br/><br/>2. Roles in the game<br/>Welcome players. Your journey is about to begin. Before unsheathing your imaginary swords and invoking the power of magic, it's important that you read this book. Among these pages is enclosed immense power, all the rules needed to play My Fantasy, the only way to defeat the menace hanging over us.<br/>The first thing you need to know is your role in the game. When you and your friends sit around the table as ready as knights can be for battle, one of you will play as the GM, all the others will be player characters.<br/> <br/>2.1 The Game Master<br/>When you are the GM, you hold an immense power over the story, so you must treat the player characters like protagonists in a heroic movie. You can use all your resources to give them a life full of adventure. You should rejoice in their successes and mourn their failures.<br/>It's your duty to listen to the players\u2019 input. They will often suggest elements on their own while asking you what their characters can see and hear from the world around them. Your job is to say yes, taking advantage of what they introduce as a basis for setting interesting obstacles and threats.<br/>Playing My Fantasy is almost like having a conversation. Every time you say something and introduce any element, ask them "what do you do?" in order to pass the ball in their hands and build a lively conversation. Also ask them "why are you doing this?", It's important to know the reason for their actions. You are their fan, and it's up to you to be sure that the characters have something to sink their teeth into.<br/>If you think they are in trouble, use all you can from their character sheet to help. Pester their bonds, offer opportunities to use their skills and make sure they have a chance to shine. Use each of their contributions to help them move their characters around the world but also to advance the menace at the same time. Closer. Always closer.<br/>One of your tasks is also to portray all the non-player characters (NPCs). Create them with deep, complex lives, but always at all times that they are nothing more than extras. They real protagonists are the player characters (PCs).<br/><br/>A Different Role<br/>You'll notice that My Fantasy works in a peculiar way for the GM. It's not up to you to direct players to a definite decision nor tell them everything they see and hear in the world. The players have the freedom to steer the story through their actions and choices and the power to add elements to the game world without having to ask.<br/>Using a metaphor from the musical world: As GM you're not a conductor or a composer. It's not your role to decide the beginning of action and its ending. Think of yourself as a bass player. You are there to perform the background track so the other players can play their melodies and express themselves freely.<br/> <br/>2.2 The players<br/>You are the heroes. You have the daunting task of defeating the menace to protect everything you love and believe in. Each of you will create and roleplay one of these heroes, outlining their past and guiding them into battle, exploration and mystery solving.<br/>As players you have authority over your character: what they do, think and want. The GM will ask "why are you doing this?" (e.g. if you say that you look out the window, the GM will ask: "why are you doing this?", you might answer that you want to check the house of the governor to keep an eye on who enters and exits). As players you have authority on the past story of your hero, the GM can not intrude in it.<br/>Unlike other games My Fantasy allows you to introduce environmental elements and NPCs, but you'll always need to ask the GM (e.g. you can decide that you want a knight to appear before you. The GM will usually tell \u201cyes, and...\u201d and will probably ask you who he is and how you know him as well as adding more details. The GM\u2019s task is to use the elements you introduce as a basis for setting new challenges and obstacles.<br/>Your main resource, as players, are the \u201cHero points\u201d. Using one Hero point you can force the GM to accept an element you described. But remember that you're not playing against the GM. Your task is to play to explore the limits of your character, in order to see him suffer and rejoice, fight, win and fall; to see him defeat the nearing enemy, or perhaps, to see him run home with the defeat in its heart.<br/>My Fantasy is not a tactical game. Play for the aesthetic of the story and you'll be playing well.  <br/><br/>Act in freedom, fight without mercy.<br/>Just like with the GM, your role differs when compared to other RPGs. You are not here to follow the story created by the GM but you have the freedom to set the scenes and to influence the scenarios with your ideas and your choices. All this power must not be wasted: the best way in which you can do it is play in a heartfelt way. Don't wait for the GM to give you a mission to accomplish, set it yourself. Create items that you care about and like, bring the story where you want it to go and don't be afraid of letting your hero act in the most passionate way. My Fantasy features active, brave heroes,. It works thanks to proactive and creative players.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438084/#Comment_438084" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-03T10:41:47+00:00" title="September  3, 2014 10:41AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to publish the role of the players!

Each of you will create and roleplay one of these heroes, outlining their past and guiding them into battle, exploration and mystery solving.<br/>As players you have authority over your character: what they do, think and want. The GM will ask "why are you doing this?" (e.g. if you say that you look out the window, the GM will ask: "why are you doing this?", you might answer that you want to check the house of the governor to keep an eye on who enters and exits). As players you have authority on the past story of your hero, the GM can not intrude in it.<br/>Unlike other games \u201cMy Fantasy\u201d allows you to introduce environmental elements and NPCs, but you'll always need to ask the GM (e.g. you can decide that you want a knight to appear before you. The GM will usually tell \u201cyes, and...\u201d and will probably ask you who he is and how you know him as well as adding more details. The GM's task is to use the elements you introduce as a basis for setting new challenges and obstacles.<br/><br/>Your main resource, as players, are the \u201cHero points\u201d. Using 1 Hero point you can force the GM to accept an element you described. But remember that you're not playing against the GM. Your task is to play to explore the limits of your character, in order to see him suffer and rejoice, fight, win and fall; to see him defeat the nearing enemy, or perhaps, to see him run home with the defeat in its heart.<br/>\u201cMy Fantasy\u201d is not a tactical game. Play for the aesthetic of the story and you'll be playing well.\xa0<br/><br/>*Act in freedom, fight without mercy*<br/>Just like with the GM, your role differs when compared to other RPGs. You are not here to follow the story created by the GM but you have the freedom to set the scenes and to influence the scenarios with your ideas and your choices. All this power must not be wasted: the best way in which you can do it is play in a heartfelt way. Don't wait for the GM to give you a mission to accomplish, set it yourself. Create items that you care about and like, bring the story where you want it to go and don't be afraid of letting your hero act in the most passionate way. \u201cMy Fantasy\u201d deals with active and brave heroes, and works thanks to proactive and creative players.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438186/#Comment_438186" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T03:09:29+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  3:09AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very happy!

Giovanni has read the entire manual and wants to be the GM for this evening of heroic endeavors. The Players have prepared 18 6-sided dice, 2 Hero character sheets, 3 6-sided dice of a different color, some white paper and pencils. [page 9 of the manual to read about the Roles in the Game] <br/><br/>SETUP OF THE GAME <br/>Giovanni, the GM, asks the players, starting from Daniele: <br/>\u201cWhat kind of Fantasy setting would you like to play, something inspired by the Lord of the Rings or something Steampunk Style? <br/><br/>GM &lt;&lt; Try to describe two elements that you would like to see in the game! &gt;&gt;. <br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I would like to see Medieval Fantasy and a lot of different races &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Luca, what about you instead? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Luca &lt;&lt; A Fantasy light on Magic is fine by me, and I would prefer to see only humans at first &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Ok Luca, is having a just a few races really important to you? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Yes, i would like it better if we started with only humans! &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Daniele, do you want to change something in what Luca said? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; Fine by me, maybe we could introduce new races later in the game? &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Very well, then your characters will be Humans in a Fantasy world low on magic, but during the game we could introduce new races never discovered untill now! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>CHOICE OF THE ARCHETYPE <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Ok, everyone take a Character sheet, and choose your archetype between Warrior, Magician and Explorer. Don't worry if you choose the same archetype, the important is that you like it! &gt;&gt;.<br/><br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I want to be a Magician! &gt;&gt;. <br/>Magician <br/>You spent so much time on those books that now an arcane power vibrates in your eyes, in your flesh, in your soul. The sky opens at your command, the rules of reality disappear and blinding thunders dart from the tip of your fingers. <br/>As a magician there is no one as good as you in the ways of magic, in spell casting, and so accustomed as you to the arcane mysteries. <br/><br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I want to be a Warrior! &gt;&gt;. <br/>Warrior <br/>You are a master of combat. The battlefield feels like home, and the warm blood gushing from your enemies is your life reason. Doesn't matter if you are a brawny barbarian or an agile swordsman, the battle flows in your veins.<br/>As a warrior there is no one as good as you in combat, in dealing with weapons and in war tactics. <br/><br/>CHOOSE OF THE KNACKS<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Okay, now that you have chosen your archetype, you can customize it, to do so you have to choose two Knacks of your character! See them as special abilities, unique characteristics of your Character! The best way to create them is to tie them to your archetype, if you are a Magician you could specify your strength in Fire Magic! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I like it! I want my Mage to be expert with Fire Magic, and also would like to use \u201cCold Strategist\u201d from the manual, which should define my character's personality! &gt;&gt; <br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Brute Force intrigues me, I like the idea of a strong warrior. As a second Knack i'll choose Smug! Yes, my character is at best a little full of himself! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>GM &lt;&lt; All right, you can write it all on your characters sheets &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>DEFINING THE CHARACTER <br/>[Reference: 3.4 Define your Character - page 18] <br/><br/>GM &lt;&lt;Daniele, tell us a bit about your character, use what your character can do as a base for his story! For starters, Why is that he can use Fire Magic like that? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; It was the first Dark magic that I was able to master, since then I've been studying flames with passion and am now a skilled connoisseur of that particular discipline&gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Ok, that's fine! What about him being a Cold Strategist? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; At the academy, when I was studying, we were taught to be calm and disciplined while searching the solution to every kind of threat! &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Could you describe him physically? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; He's thin and slightly hunched from too much time spent on books! He has lively blue eyes and graying hair! His hair is grey even though he is young, a peculiarity of his family! He usually wears a grey tunic with a red line in the middle from the Wizard Academy &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>GM &lt;&lt; Luca, now it's your turn! &gt;&gt;. <br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Brute Force is a something I am endowed since i was really young! My father said that our grandfather was also like that since birth! I'm Smug because since childhood I could rely on that gift and therfore i could easily prevail in most games and always wanted to be considered the number one! I'm always dressed in common leather clothes: even if practical all my clothes are well finished and i always appear good! My hair is jet-black and i got piercing green eyes and a sarcastic smile always on my face! &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Okay, that's enough for now &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>THE MENACE <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Daniele, while doing something you gained awareness of something dark, a luring Menace about to plunge on your town. How did you come to know about this Menace? Where were you? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I was in the tower of magic and I was looking at a crystal ball, until now I was never able to read anything into it, but suddenly I felt a trembling sensation into my whole body, and I could see the color of flames beyond the high peaks shrouded in mist! &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Ok, stop there, would you go on Luca? Where were you? What did you see? Try to add something to what Daniele said! &gt;&gt;. <br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I was on patrol under the mountain! During my normal shift, suddenly I heard a dreadful scream and blood froze in my veins clearing the smile that smile that's always on my face! Only then, I saw flames coming from one of the peaks of the Frozen Mountain! &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Ok, we've added enough details &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>CREATING BONDS <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Guys, we now have to define the Past and Present Bonds. Past Bonds are something that strongly binds you to your cities, to your work, your family, your loved ones. The Present Bonds are something that strongly binds you to the Menace, a reason to go and fight it! You will need to create three Past Bonds and two Present Bonds, and for the Present ones at least one must be a Bond between the two of you! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; My character could be the brother of yours, Luca, what do you think? &gt;&gt;. <br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Um ... okay with me! Then I change my description, I also have grey hair! &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Well, then, write this as your first Bond, specifying each other's names and that it's brotherly love! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; For the Past, I want a relationship with the academy tower: "I worked so hard to become its guardian." The other one is with Rachel, the woman of my life: I never declared my love to her. But above all, I will miss my mother, she found in me the gift of Magic &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt; Great, you just need another Present Bond! For now, the curiosity to discover what is happening might also be enough &gt;&gt;. <br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I'm going to do it because i believe its my duty to protect the city, and because my studies made me curious! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Now it's up to me, then! I will miss my father, Barbuck, who's also the man who taught me to fight with a sword. I will miss my role as Guard of the city and I'm here to protect it. I will miss my daughter Adele, she already lost her Mother: "What would she do without me?" &gt;&gt;. <br/>GM &lt;&lt;Ok&gt;&gt;. <br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I depart in this adventure because I want to become the Governor of Castle, a desire linked to my being smug, but apart from that i really care about this city. I also have the bond with the character of Daniele, obviously &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>SPECIAL EQUIPMENT <br/>[Reference: 3.7 Equipment - page 23] <br/>GM &lt;&lt; We're almost there with the preparation! You can now create an Armor or a Special Item, that can be anything from sword forged by the greatest blacksmith to a magical artifact that enhances fire magic! The important thing is that its effect is specific: the sword might shine if it senses trouble while the artifact might enhance fire magic! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Giovanni, I definitely want a sword! It could be my father's and makes my fighting more accurate! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; For starters I want an Armor, or rather I want to make the Magicians grey tunic to be protective enough! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>GM &lt;&lt; You will be able, of course, to buy more Equipment during the game! With this guys, we finished creating the Characters! Here we go! &gt;&gt;. <br/><br/>PREPARATION OF THE TABLE <br/>Before starting the adventure, I put on the table a number of D6 equal to the number of Players * 3 to create the GM Pool, and the same number of D6 at the center of the table to create the Destiny Pool. In our case, both Pools will have 9D6. <br/><br/>TO BE CONTINUED!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438853/#Comment_438853" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T12:38:07+00:00" title="September 30, 2014 12:38PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great writeup!

That said, Luca, would you like to frame the first scene since you were the last to create your Character? &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Okay! What should I do? &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; You can frame the scene starting from wherever you like, even very close to the Menace. In short, start from the point that you think is the most interesting to play! Then, we will see what happens... The important thing is that Daniele's Character and yours meet and depart together! You're the only ones believing that the Menace is about to hit and have seen the signs of its coming! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Daniele and I left the CIty and ascended Mount Cold using the old trade route connecting ours to the city of Utopia! The fog just surrounded us as we arrived in the place where the flames we saw were! &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Right then you notice that powerful claws have scratched the mountain wall, and some rocks are pitchy! Daniele, what do you think it was? Remember that you are a wizard and you have an immense knowledge! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; Ah nice! I read in a book that an old Dragon was defeated right on top of this mountain falling into an eternal sleep, could it be that he awakened? &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Luca, what else can you add? &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I also know the Legend of the Dragon! Our Father told us about that! The story speaks about a Dragon with solid rock skin! If it were that dragon from the legends it would be a big trouble. But i'm not giving up, I want to face it! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>DEFINE THE OBJECTIVE OF THE FIRST MISSION<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Fine! Now that we know that it is a dragon, what do you think the goal of the mission could be? &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Killing the Dragon! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; Yes, fine by me, chasing it away from our city! &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; From this moment on, you will notice that there will be no more interruptions during the adventure, we have basically finished the game setup &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439154/#Comment_439154" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T23:55:34+00:00" title="October  6, 2014 11:55PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THE ADVENTURE BEGINS<br/>[4. The Conflict]<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Just when you're thinking that you might be ready to face the Dragon, you see its colossal figure appear behind the fog! Instants later, flames are already springing from his mouth! &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; I use 2D6 from the GM Pool as Opposition, and 1D6 to create a Condition. The Dragon is immune to Magic &gt;&gt;. The D6 used by the GM to create the Condition, is added to the Destiny Pool.<br/>\xa0<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I want to be the first to act if possible! I use my magic to raise a protection against fire and shout to my brother "Attack it as soon as you can!" &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I'm playing according to my archetype, Magician, so i can the base 2D6! Then, for using \u201ccold strategist\u201d i get 1D6 from the Destiny Pool: I'm keeping my nerve even if there's a huge fire-breathing dragon in front of me! I also want to use a Past Bond and get another D6 from the Destiny Pool: I think about my tower, I don't want it to be destroyed! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Giovanni &lt;&lt; Fine, mark the box next to the Bond you used! And then put a mark on the bar for Past Bonds! Now roll the dice and let's see what happens! You succeed if you roll a 5 or a 6 on as many dice as the ones i put forward at the start of the conflict &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Destiny Pool: 8D6 remaining (2 spent and 1 gained from the condition)<br/>GM Pool: 6 D6 remaining (2 put forward as opposition and 1 spent for a condition)<br/>\xa0<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; Ok, i Roll 3D6 (2 base D6s + 1D6 from the Destiny Pool) and i already have an automatic success for the Bond i played (1D6 from the Destiny Pool). My results are 4,3,6! Well, that's one hit plus an automatic success! I can raise a protective magic shiled against fire! My city will be saved! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Destiny Pool: 10 D6 remaining (The D6s used by the GM go to the Destiny Pool, here it's two)<br/>GM Pool: 8 D6 remaining ( The D6s taken from the Destiny Pool go to the GM Pool, here it's two)<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; The Dragon moves forward without fear towards you and shakes the valley below with a dreadful roar as the flames are reflected by the magic shield! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Now it's my turn! I unsheathe our Father's\xa0 sword and scornfully jump on the dragon. I have no fear at all!!! &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; I use 3D6 from the GM Pool &gt;&gt;.\xa0<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I'm playing accordingly to my archetype so I can roll the base 3D6! I use my sword (Special Item) and now I succeed if i get a 4, 5 or 6 (to do that i spend 1D6 from the Destiny Pool). I use the Past Bond to my father for an automatic success: "Father your teachings have not been in vain! You'll be proud of me!" then i mark the used Bond and one of the slots on the bar of the Past Bonds and take 1D6 from the Destiny Pool. I'm also using the \u201csmug\u201d and \u201cBrute Force\u201d Knacks: i take 1D6 from the Destiny Pool to play Smug and in doing so my character shouts: "Dragon, prepared to become my new dress!" then i take another D6 to play Brute Force cause i try to jump on top of the dragon's head (and it's huge!) &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Destiny Pool: 6 D6 remaining (4 spent)<br/>GM Pool: 5 D6 remaining (3 put forward as opposition)<br/>\xa0<br/>Luca &lt;&lt;In summary, i'm rolling 5D6 and already have an automatic success due to the Bond i played. I also used my Special Item so i succeed with 4,5 or 6. Results: 2,2,4,3,3. Damn! I got only 2 successes summing the one with the dice and the automatic one. I failed!<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Since you failed the D6s you took from the Destiny Pool, 4 in this example, become Hero Points! Put them next to your Character sheet &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; You jump on the dragon's head, but the beast is faster than you and bites you with all its strength, you're hurt but you can free yourself from its grip. This lowers your Stress value of one, from \u201cGood conditions\u201d you become \u201cWounded\u201d &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt;Ouch! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Since it was a failure, the D6s Luca took from the Destiny Pool become Hero Points: he must put those dice near his Character Sheet. The dices the GM spent go back in his Pool.<br/>\xa0<br/>Destiny Pool: 6 D6 remaining<br/>GM Pool: 8 D6 remaining (the dices the GM spent go back in his Pool)<br/>\xa0<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; My turn again! Since the dragon is immune to magic, i hurl some rocks against him! &gt;&gt;<br/>GM &lt;&lt; You really think the dragon would just sit and watch what you are doing without reacting? He turns to you and is ready to hit you with flames &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; I put forward 3D6 as the Opposition! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I'm playing according to my Archetype because i'm levitating the rocks with my magic, so i can roll the base 3D6! Then i use \u201cCold Strategist\u201d (I take 1D6 from the Destiny Pool), my aim is to get his attention away my brother, to do that i attract it to myself! I use the\xa0 Bond with Luca (I take 1D6 from the Destiny Pool) because i suffer when my brother is hurt! I am also using the scenario since I'm throwing rocks and stones on the Dragon (I take 1D6 from the Destiny Pool) &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Destiny Pool: 3 D6 remaining (3 spent)<br/>GM Pool: 5 D6 (3 put forward as opposition)<br/>\xa0<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; So, I'm rolling the base 3D6 and another 2D6 I got from the Destiny Pool (1 for \u201cCold Strategist\u201d and 1 for using the scenario) for a total of 5D6. I also played the Bond with Luca so I have one additional automatic success! I roll the dice and get: 2,2,1,1,4. I got no success\xa0 apart from the automatic one so I failed miserably &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Since it's a failure, the 3D6 from the Destiny Pool become Hero Points: put those dice near your Character Sheet &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; The Dragon avoids the stones that you hurled against him, and breaths again to destroy your protective vest, that protects you but is damaged in the process &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; That's enough, this dragon is trying my patience! I use the Heroic Act: i stand between my brother and the dragon, doesn't matter if i'm knocked out, i want to save him! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>GM \xa0&lt;&lt; Ok Luca, by doing that all the dice i used as opposition (which were 3) become Hero Points for you. If you want, you can give some of them to Daniele &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I give 1 of them to Daniele! Brother, finish him! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Luca you're now \u201cknocked out\u201d and out of the game for this mission! You must now put a mark on the Past Bonds bar &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Destiny Pool: 3 D6 remaining<br/>GM Pool: 5 D6 remaining<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; I put forward 3D6, it's all or nothing! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; Damned Dragon! I immediately spend 3 Hero Points (putting the used dice in the GM Pool) to increase the likelihood of success (4,5 or 6 all succeed). I use Magic to melt the rocks beneath the dragon and make him fall in the resulting hole; this way i get the base 3D6! Using \u201cCold Strategist\u201d i try to attract the dragon to a point where the rock is more resistant, and doing so I also use the scenario: I take 2D6 from the Destiny Pool for this action! I also use a Past Bond (1D6 from the Destiny Pool): if things go bad I will have lost all my chances to tell Rachel that I love her! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Destiny Pool: 0 D6 remaining (3 spent)<br/>GM Pool: 2 D6 remaining (3 put forward as opposition, 3 gained as part of the hero points exchange)<br/>\xa0<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I'm Rolling 3D6 and i already have an automatic success: my results are 4-5-6! Dragon, you're time has come! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I see Rachel's smile in my mind... my hands start to glow and the Dragon is only steps away when my magic melts the rock beneath him and he sinks! In a matter of seconds the rocks are solid again, tearing apart the Dragon's body and stopping him forever! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>GM Pool 5 D6 remaining (The D6s used by the GM go to the Destiny Pool, here it's 3)<br/>Destiny Pool 3 D6 remaining (The D6s used by the GM go to the Destiny Pool, here it's 3)<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; You have reached the Goal!

That said you get 3 additional Hero Point to be divided due to the dice remaining in the Destiny Pool and Daniele, who has less total Hero Points (used them in the last conflict), gets 2 of them (after equally dividing the points, the rest goes to the person with less hero points)! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Since you reached the goal and Luca's character was Knocked Out, now you must do a Bonding Scene. But before you do it, you must know how your character feels so that you can interpret it in the next scene &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I used only 1 Past Bond and I have two marks on the Past bar and 1 mark on the Present bar. &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Well, your character is discouraged, he sees staying in the city as more important, he already misses it a lot! He has a lot of doubts about whether to continue or not, but that is your choice as a player. &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I used 2 Past Bonds and 1 Present Bond &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Your're also wondering about wether to continue or not, you want to go back because you miss Rachel, your Tower and you're fearful! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>GM &lt;&lt; On the other hand, after this battle, you discover something new about the Dragon! Daniele, describe what you find out! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; The Dragon was definitely evoked by a powerful wizard, there were magical seals to keep it embedded in the rock, and it could never shatter them without external help! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; Yes, when I jumped on his head I noticed he had a Purple Opal set on it, which emitted a strange glow! &gt;&gt;.<br/>GM &lt;&lt; Most likely it was a magical stone similar to those used by Utopia to control their armies! What do you think the next Goal could be? &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; Going to Utopia and finding out if it's them who awaken the Dragon! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; That's perfect! &gt;&gt;.<br/>\xa0<br/>Giovanni &lt;&lt; Ok, where do you want to go to rest? You go back in town? &gt;&gt;.<br/>Daniele &lt;&lt; I take care of my brother with magic myself, caressing him gently, he saved my life in the battle! We camp just below the fog, taking the trade route to Utopia! I'm afraid of losing Rachel, but I can not allow Utopia to invade our city, I care too much. A tear drips on my face! &gt;&gt;.<br/>Luca &lt;&lt; I regain consciousness next to a fire, i hug my brother, I was really scared of losing him, and our father would be proud of us... I miss him, but we can not stop ... I want to go on! Whoever did this will pay! I Change my Present Bond with "They will pay!" &gt;&gt;.<br/>Giovanni &lt;&lt; Okay, Luca &gt;&gt;\ufeff<br/><br/>The end for this Ap!:-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440109/#Comment_440109" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-14T12:23:54+00:00" title="November 14, 2014 12:23PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After two month, we are done with proofreading and we're now in the final stages of layout! <br/><br/><b>Thanks to all the friends who gave us feedback! </b><br/><br/>See you soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440836/#Comment_440836" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-11T16:00:53+00:00" title="December 11, 2014  4:00PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>My Fantasy is ready!!!

It's not a problem for me selling for zero euro! I love to share with my friend RPG!<br/><br/>But this is the only way for translating and producing other RPG! So if you can, also if you have purchased this game for zero euro, take a moment to write a review and rate My Fantasy RPG! If you have a blog, have a g+ profile, facebook profile spend one minuts to talk about My Fantasy RPG (if you don't have the game, contact me and I send you a complimentary copy for a review).<br/><br/>I'm in Italy, unfortunatly I don't speak well english for make some demo in Hangout, make a video tutorial, and to have the possibility to go in a CON presenting my game!<br/><br/>By the way, even if I wanted , it's not possibile for health reasons. So the only way is your help! <br/><br/>Thank you in advice and a big hug to all from Italy!\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444760/#Comment_444760" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-12T12:58:21+00:00" title="April 12, 2015 12:58PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paper copy of My Fantasy RPG now on Lulu.com:<br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/vas-quas-editrice/my-fantasy-rpg/paperback/product-22124824.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/vas-quas-editrice/my-fantasy-rpg/paperback/product-22124824.html</a><br/><br/>If you have bought Paper Copy Edition, contact us to receive also digital edition!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
