(See <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13406" rel="nofollow">here</a> for full write-up.)<br/><br/>Consider:<br/><br/>The game requires forethought and planning, including cooperation with other players in order to make any progress. This means that players are interested in strategizing ahead of time, outside play periods/sessions, but it also gives them a reason to interact with one another, instead of just daydreaming. Incentivizing interaction between the players between sessions? That's <i>interesting</i>, I think.<br/><br/>A format which requires alliances and treachery, negotiation, etc, produces a constantly shifting playing field. The "topology" of the game (in Diplomacy, it's which countries share a border, and which are further apart) determines, to a great degree, what "moves" are possible and which ones are not. This kind of thing could be used to dictate story concerns (e.g. place the hero and the villain on opposite sides of the "map", satisfying the story's need not to end too quickly). But it can also be used to dictate player interactions. (More on this below, in my first question.)<br/><br/>So, in this thread I'd like to explore some of the potential of the board game Diplomacy and then to see how these design principles can be brought into story game design. So, first, look at how the game is normally played, then later we can mine that for our purposes.<br/><br/>I'll be posting questions, and we can discuss. Here's my first one:<br/><br/><b>How does a player of Diplomacy interact with players/nations who are *distant* from him/her?</b><br/><br/>Your neighbours in the game are clearly to be treated as trusted allies (i.e. you make a deal), "false" allies (try to trick someone into a deal which allows you to screw them over, or otherwise influence their behaviour), or outright enemies (with full-on aggression).<br/><br/>However, more distant nations, according to veteran players, are good allies. They have no means of competing for resources against each other, so they make good collaborators.<br/><br/>So, what does it look like in a game of Diplomacy when, say, Turkey and England (the two most distant nations) communicate to great advantage? What do they talk about, what kind of offers do they make each other? What are their incentives? <br/><br/>What does it look like when two distant nations like Turkey and England are communicating to best mutual advantage?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302885/#Comment_302885" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T16:38:40+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  4:38PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an enormous amount of respect for the design of Diplomacy. There are very, very few games where I don't have any objections to the design - I'm just a critical thinker that way. <i>Diplomacy</i> and <i>Go</i> are pretty much the only ones I can name right now, and the latter has had, ahem, quite a bit of playtesting.<br/><br/>Haven't seen too much immediately Diplomacy-inspired roleplaying, which doesn't necessarily surprise me, as a very well made game rarely leaves sufficient space; one needs to rip stuff out assiduously to make room for new things. I do have a Diplomacy-inspired card game in my drawer, but it's very different from Diplomacy, and sadly not quite good enough in comparison.<br/><br/>As for your question: I think that a good player should not be primarily interacting, but rather influencing the overall game-state in such ways as to cause himself long-term advantage. I believe in a balance of powers in the macro-strategy of the game, generally speaking, which means that my usual goal in communication is to ensure that the only Power that grows on the expense of others is my own. In service of this goal I will give strategic advice to distant Powers, carry messages real and imagined from one to another, broker alliances to prevent a strong Power from breaking out and so on. There's plenty to do on the board if you don't think of your communications as only tactical; think strategically, think of what you need to be saying to England to allow him to survive or to encourage him to take a direction that makes his advance slower and allows his victim to catch his breath. Your having a Power on the board yourself is essentially a coincidence in this regard, you could be talking to the other Powers just the same even if you didn't and your only goal was to slow down the game's resolution - that's what you are doing in your communications, slowing down the resolution in distant parts of the board so as to make yourself the first and only Power that rises to global (board-wide) domination.<br/><br/>The other reason to communicate actively with distant Powers is that you want to be gauging those players and allowing them to gauge you so as to be ready when you inevitably end up in conflicts where both of you have stakes. It's impossible to play a game of Diplomacy to the end without England and Turkey having a mutual interest; the minute one starts going at it with Russia the other has to decide whether it's to their advantage to come in on the flank, after all. This might even happen quite early in the game, it's not unreasonable for both of those Powers to be chewing on the Tsar in 1902-3 already. With Turkey vs. France it's a bit slower, but both can take Italy as their first targets with appropriate diplomacy, so their interests might cross pretty soon as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302897/#Comment_302897" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T18:15:29+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  6:15PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In early playtesting of Polaris, we had the Mistaken and the two Moons go off by themselves and conspire about what they were going to do to the Heart.

A more flawed game is often a more fruitful way to begin when designing something like a story game. Still, I think it's an interesting challenge: the interactions of the players are just so differently charged in this game that I would like to see how it could be leveraged into a story game-type space.<br/><br/>For instance, I've never played an RPG that encouraged a paranoid feeling building in tension up until the in-person session.<br/><br/>(Oddly enough, Diplomacy and Go are the two games I'm learning how to play right now, and really the only two that I have every been "into" aside from Chess.)<br/><br/>JWalt,<br/><br/>How did that conspiring change the feeling of those scenes, if at all? Did it make things more tense? More fast-paced? How did it feel different?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303247/#Comment_303247" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T15:50:04+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  3:50PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking about this myself, in terms of a competitive RPG.

Problem: my army killed your army! No it didn't!<br/>B. 100% GM fiat. Problem: GM burnout.<br/>C. 90% rules, 10% GM fiat. Problem: with the more freeformy stuff jettisoned you ended up with things playing like a board game with things like people posting about the election campaigns of the various parties in their country falling by the wayside as they didn't have any mechanical representation so why bother?<br/><br/>Pretty awesome games in theory, but I felt like they never hit on the right ruleset to make the awesome apply in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
