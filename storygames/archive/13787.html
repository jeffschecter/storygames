(Does a tiny con have tiny con-crud, or is it regular-sized con-crud? Johnzo will have to chime in and let us know.)<br/><br/>My take home summary for the conzo: fantastic. I was sketchy about having the action split up between three different venues (four if you count both rooms of the apartment) but it made the games nicely intimate.<br/><br/>I'm really curious to hear about the games that went on. I eavesdropped on a tiny bit of Venetian Tragedy, but not enough to get the scoop.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311982/#Comment_311982" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T01:38:58+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  1:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 6:17AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (yanked from the bite-sized AP thread)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Monsterhearts: Ben R managed to make playing a Vampire look fun and interesting and made moves that nudged our Chosen towards her Darkest Self.  Our Mortal went there too.  Teen angst galore.<br/><br/>Oh, and we all learned a little something about Thorton Wilder's<i>Our Town</i>.</blockquote>\nGood things come to those who pick random characters. I never would have picked vampire normally, but it worked perfectly to highlight other people's issues. The Monsterhearts template is pretty much perversely built to attract people but then keep them at arm's length, so that was a great fit. Picking the Chosen as the person who saved me rather than going a more obvious Chosen vs Vampire route also really paid off.<br/><br/>I could see playing a lot more with those characters and really milking and twisting the relationships. I dug Jackson emancipating Casey (the Mortal) with some emerging bad-assery as a replacement for her unsatisfactory romances, and Christian just grabbed Carmen's (the Chosen) self-doubt and ran with it. Lovely. I definitely wanted to see more about Rowan the Fae's "stolen gift," and what would happen to Rowan if he couldn't fulfill his goal of getting in on with a true love (any true love, mind you). I could see serious trouble around episode 3.<br/><br/>Also, homecoming dance with the <i>Our Town</i> graveyard in the background: creepy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312061/#Comment_312061" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T10:54:29+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 10:54AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 1:23PM by johnzo.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For posterity, these were the games: <br/><br/><b>Slot 1:</b><br/>GRG1: Old School Small World Hack (Brendan)<br/>S&amp;C: Burning Wheel Trouble in Hochen (Wilhelm)<br/>APT1: Monsterhearts (Joe)<br/><br/><b>Impromptu Dinner Gaming</b><br/>GRG1: Zombie Dice (Jon/Seth?)<br/>GRG2: Dixit (me)<br/><br/><b>Slot 2:</b><br/>GRG1: Gamma World (Jon)<br/>S&amp;C: Thunderstone / a rail game I can't remember (Wilhelm)<br/>APT1: Venetian Tragedy (Matthew)<br/>APT2: Drifter's Escape (Susan)<br/><br/>We did lose some cohesion by hosting games in three different buildings -- the dinner run was a janky affair -- but the games themselves really benefited from less noise pollution.
