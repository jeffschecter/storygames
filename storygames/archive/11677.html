I agree overwhelming them with rules they don't need to know yet is a bad idea (see content). But the other extreme, "do anything" does not work in my experience. <br/><br/>I've run around 8+ games in the last 2 weeks (not a common thing!), many with people completely new to tabletop roleplaying (from actors to garbage men to electricians to teachers to architects to former LARPers and war gamers), and before assuming what the best way to engage them is I will prequalify a bit and in every single case leading with constraints won every time. People preferred to play pre-generated characters. And preferred to play games with clearly defined situations and goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261327/#Comment_261327" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T14:05:31+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  2:05PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having a goal to pursue is fun.

What matters is that the goal is accepted and internalized.  So, you can tell a player to pick a goal for her character and she picks something without really thinking and doesn't really understand or care.  But, you can also say, "Hey, in this game your character really wants to steal the Crown Jewels from that guy's character."  So long as she says, "Cool!  I want to do that."

Here's how I'd apply that to my experience:<br/><br/>When handed a goal, I often accept it with a shrug.  "Okay, this will allow play to proceed, sure."<br/><br/>When picking from a few goals, I accept my chosen goal with more enthusiasm.  "These will all allow play to proceed, but I like this one most."<br/><br/>When creatively defining my own goal, I accept the goal with maximum enthusiasm.  "Success will satisfy my unique creative vision for where the fiction should go!"<br/><br/>As for <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6127548813950043200" rel="nofollow">the video</a>, I just finished watching it.  The first half doesn't have much substance beyond two points:<br/>1) faced with too many options, people often avoid making any decision at all <br/>2) faced with too many options, people often use the <i>quickest/easiest</i> basis for choosing, not the <i>best</i> basis for choosing<br/><br/>But starting at 28:47 it gets into some more interesting choice psychology.  I enjoyed it from that point on.  (Also: 29:53 begins a discussion game designers might enjoy, about product capability vs usability.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261371/#Comment_261371" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T19:10:20+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  7:10PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's great for a game to offer choices, thats mostly what games are about, if we did not want to make choices we would watch a movie or read a book. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think board games have really started to hit the nail on the head as far as how many choices are good for a game to offer. Most rpgs have players making far too many choices to create a character, systems that use point buy are extra guilty because each point is a new choice and unless the player knows the rules and situations they will encounter they hardly have any clue as to how they should make those choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261386/#Comment_261386" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T21:44:08+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:44PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't actually taken the time to watch the video, I'll be honest, but I have read a fair amount of Schwartz's work in Judgment and Decision Making (JDM) research.  He and other researchers have isolated some really cool effects of choice structures on people's eventual decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Like David points out, when there are too many options without a clear winner--when you have several (even just two) options that are very similar in perceived value--you tend to delay making a decision.  This basically comes down to fear of making the wrong choice.  You want to wait and gather more information, either about the present options (some new aspect that you hadn't considered before that shows you the "winner") or about a different, unforseen option (you hope something better will come along than any of the present options).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn gaming, imagine a player is not too familiar with the rules and is in an intense combat.  The other players are impressing upon her how dangerous and exciting the combat is, so she feels like she needs to make the right choice of maneuver.  But, all of the maneuvers look pretty similar to her.  She doesn't know the game well enough to pick the obvious best choice, so she sits there anxious because she doesn't want to fail, waiting for another player to decide for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyler's exactly right, I think, when he evaluates most board games and point buy games.  Most board games offer not only a small set of choices, they also make it clear what the advantages and disadvantages of each choice are.  They usually avoid making choices appear to be equal.  Lots of point buy games strive for "balance," wherein each possible expenditure of a point is equal to all other possibilities.  While this is great for a robust, fair game, it is horrible for encouraging decisions amongst players.  With so many choices that all appear to be equal to each other, it becomes very very hard to make any decision at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Decades of research on JDM has shown that the idea of the "economic man"--the concept that people make the best possible decision most of the time--is very wrong.  People deviate from this ideal in many ways.  The first, David points out, is that people tend to pick the quickest or easiest choice.  They pick the one that requires the least cost and gets them the rewards fastest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example with our unfamiliar player.  Given all of these options, she is confused, so the game master starts to explain each maneuver to her.  She's still confused.  There are a lot of details in each maneuver, and she doesn't really know what they mean.  In this situation, let's say she's surrounded, so it might be the best choice for her to take a block action, to avoid being dropped.  But the block maneuver is confusing, involving weird dice allocation and other complicated stuff she doesn't understand.  So, instead, she takes a Strike action, which simply involves her rolling all of her attack dice against one opponent.  Let's imagine this isn't a very good tactic.  She's not doing it because she wants to fail or isn't trying to win; she just wants to make a decision and be done with it.  She wants the reward of successfully completing her turn as fast as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  A cool one.  People tend to evaluate options sequentially, rather than simultaneously.  They tend to examine most of the implications of one option before looking at the next at all.  In doing so, another deviation from perfect choices appears--people tend to settle for the first "good enough" option.  As soon as a choice appears that the person feels satisfactorily meets his goals, he'll take it, even if a different choice he hasn't evaluated yet would have been better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, same situation.  As the game master is explaining the choices, he explains the simple strike maneuver.  The play stops him right there and says she'll do that one.  She doesn't want to hear the rest because that one seems good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot more, but I don't want to bore anyone going on and on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261822/#Comment_261822" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T14:01:13+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  2:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting to hear more, Brenton                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261845/#Comment_261845" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T16:51:48+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  4:51PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tyler, that's a wonderful video.
