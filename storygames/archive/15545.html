These are all traditions with deep roots and many generations of refinement and they each bring something very different to the story play experience although different systems and different groups draw from each of them in different amounts. They each compliment and contradict each other in interesting and subtle ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll try and illustrate my conception of these modes of play. Please pardon the anthropomorphic descriptions if that sort of thing bothers you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngaming<br/>\nit cares about: winning<br/>\nif it made something, it would make: the perfect hammer<br/>\nwhat it offers for story play: incentives<br/>\nhow it might disrupt story play: min/maxing<br/>\n<br/>\nimprovizational acting<br/>\nit cares about: feeling the moment<br/>\nif it made something, it would make: thousands of paper flowers<br/>\nwhat it offers for story play: emotional intensity<br/>\nhow it might disrupt story play: unspontaneous or uncomfortable players<br/>\n<br/>\nstorytelling<br/>\nit cares about: the narrative arc<br/>\nif it made something, it would make: a cathedral<br/>\nwhat it offers for story play: continuity<br/>\nhow it might disrupt story play: meta-thinking about story<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is by no means comprehensive and is very open for improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is a valuable frame to consider playstyle and system mechanics and how a group might change the way it plays to achieve different outcomes. Where do you think your play falls? Are there areas of the triangle which you might want to explore more?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352473/#Comment_352473" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-25T11:16:55+00:00" title="December 25, 2011 11:16AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's pretty good.

Imagine that sort of scene taking place on a message board such as this. The player might type out the exact same words as the person sitting at the table, but it would lack the immediacy of the spontaneous performance. This text-based example would exist much more closely to the storytelling sphere than the players at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven then, there is a great range of performance which groups may partake in with some groups describing these third person actions in a matter-of-fact testimonial style and others delivering it as romantic poetry with full song and magesty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe confusion may be that a live 'storyteller' includes a lot of performance, but storytelling is an art which can be delivered via many media and my use of storytelling tries to embody that which is common across the various disciplines, some of which do draw on the resources of acting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352586/#Comment_352586" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T05:32:08+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  5:32AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be interesting to see a ternary plot with games located at the coordinates and maybe a softer bubble around them to describe the types of play they reasonably facilitate.  Assuming that some agreement could be reached on where games belong on the system, it would be neat to locate the games you most enjoy and see how that conforms to your own thinking of what you enjoy about your story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
