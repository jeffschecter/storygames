We've been doing this for a looooong time, so I think we've gotten pretty good at maximizing our fun and telling tight, self-contained stories in the time we have. I've noticed that we essentially treat every session as a one-shot, with some clear resolution, even in ongoing games. It's very rare that we'll wrap up in the middle of something, (or in the middle of nothing) - every session tends to be a coherent unit, usually part of a larger deal but discrete on its own. Occasionally we'll reach some dramatic peak and wrap a little early, or play on and table our session in a dramatic trough, but both are unusual. We've played for so long that we generally <i>know</i> what's going to fit in a full session.<br/><br/>So I guess playing in the same social constraints repetitively shapes your play around those constraints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305016/#Comment_305016" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T14:19:04+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  2:19PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2010 2:19PM by Ry.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>So I guess playing in the same social constraints repetitively shapes your play around those constraints.</blockquote>Also true of the social constraint of "a bunch of strangers" - in my experience.  I find a chapter of In A Wicked Age naturally runs in about 1.5, or 2.5-3 if you are teaching the game and to some / all participants.  That's a worknight game for me - and I got better and better at hitting that 1-chapter-in-a-night as time went on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305018/#Comment_305018" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T14:59:19+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  2:59PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2010 3:01PM by Mcdaldno.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a few years, I had this scenario for The Shadow of Yesterday that I pulled out and ran at conventions.<br/><br/>It was called <i>The Earth Trembles in an Uncharted Language</i>. It wasn't set in Near, but instead some other fantasy world. When all the various kingdoms were amalgamated into The New Empire, it left a huge surplus of knightly orders. So, your order become the official tax collectors of the outlying regions. And now you're arriving in the land of the mud people. Strange storms brew, bridgeways get washed out, and you end up trapped in a town at the brink of civil war. The path-forgers and the guardians are filled with animosity, the council refuses to answer your questions, and the de facto war chief is planning to seize control of the whole place. And no one wants to give you the tribute.<br/><br/>The key was: clearly, something is wrong here. Their natural order has been set out of whack, and there are scary power games going on. Someone's probably a dread necromancer. Someone wants you all dead.<br/><br/>The key to resolving the session at the right time was to go into it without figuring out who was in the right, who was in the wrong, who the necromancer is, and who wants you dead. If a set of answers start to emerge after 2 hours, then those aren't the right set of answers - you reveal a deeper level to the conspiracies and the secrets and the lies, and you reveal another faction to contend with. You don't plant red herrings or tell them they've hit a brick wall, instead you reveal (meaning: invent) new depths and reward them with new power and knowledge.<br/><br/>So, one time, they thought it was the elders council that was responsible for all the dark sorceries at work. But, when pressed, one of the council members revealed his utter disgust with magicks of any source, and revealed his distaste for the baby-whisperers: a group of midwives who had taken to the practice of whispering destinies into the wombs of fearful women, enchanting their babies to live out different fates. And then I put Secret of Fate Whispering on the table, as a possible advance. So: (1) these are not the droids you are looking for, (2) but here's a new position of power and leverage in the community, and (3) here's a game-changer.<br/><br/>Reliably, at the 3.5 hour mark (if it's a 4-hour con slot), the PCs were pointing fingers at various factions in the community, and sometimes even each other. And then you just say "yes" to a bunch of things they're saying. Yes, Player A, the war chief is the Dark Sorcerer. Yes, Player B, he is the community's only hope. Yes, Player C, the council wanted you dead. You reconcile a bunch of their hunches, and then drive for resolution - typically, there's a huge battle on a rickety bridge, with a mud-storm raging and tentacled beasts lashing about in the murk below.<br/><br/>That is how you reliably pace a convention scenario, if a pre-written scenario is really want you want. Create variables, pit people against a bunch of disparate factions, have whatever answer they arrive at 30 minutes before the session end be the correct answer.<br/><br/>Edited to add: the reason I stopped running that scenario, aside from being ready to move on, was that in retrospect I realized that it was sorta inexcusably racist. So: I was full of fail, it was problematic, and that's when I decided to ditch it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305054/#Comment_305054" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T06:31:45+00:00" title="December 18, 2010  6:31AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Create variables, pit people against a bunch of disparate factions, have whatever answer they arrive at 30 minutes before the session end be the correct answer.</blockquote>\nYep, this. Have lots of possibilities with the ending of the one shot up in the air, so hypothetically, you could keep going if they're plowing through, or you could end if people wanna get into really roleplaying for a long time. That might mean a little more advanced planning (some if -&gt; then maps, or random ideas sketched out) if you're bad at improvising, so you have those extra ideas in your back pocket just in case. Or, if you have an incredibly strong, enthusiastic, creative group of people that just won't shut up because they're so excited to play their characters (i love you, these people) it might mean having the balls to tell them to shut up and get back to the story so you're not completely off track. Unless, going off track is your thing. In which case, cool, no problem, everyone has fun regardless.<br/><br/>Also, practically, as the GM, keep an eye on the time. That'll let you know if you have to push people to move along, or stretch things out with another encounter/plot/hilarious scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305085/#Comment_305085" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T15:36:00+00:00" title="December 18, 2010  3:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like fixed-number-of-scenes might be part of the problem...<br/>What games time themselves off a realtime clock?

Twists are slower, everything is turned upside down, and now you have a new path with a new unforeseen problem to solve. <br/><br/>Condition or Twist... it's up to the GM. Often I choose based on what makes the most sense in the fiction or will lean on conditions if the mission becomes too easy (conditions make conflicts more challenging). But if the PCs are completing the mission very quickly, I'll lean towards Twists as they extend the mission and fill up the time we have to play. If we are running out of time, I'll lean towards Conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305125/#Comment_305125" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-19T07:59:49+00:00" title="December 19, 2010  7:59AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305132/#Comment_305132" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-19T09:33:13+00:00" title="December 19, 2010  9:33AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Steve, it's nearly nine o'clock.
