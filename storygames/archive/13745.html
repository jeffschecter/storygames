I'd like you to highlight aspects of the document that are really good, really innovative, really effective for you. Organization, layout, tone, use of examples, conventions it establishes, pedagogy, rhetoric, style, whatever really, really works for you - and why. If, as a text, it is way ahead of its peers I want to understand what's going on so I can steal that stuff.<br/><br/>This isn't the place to talk about things you don't like.

To answer the question, what should I do <i>here</i>, what should I do <i>now</i>? You can read the book and change the way you interact with your own GM style\u2014talking about it outright instead of feeling your way along, if you like. In that way, the text is encouraging and specific and expressing what you <i>can do</i> as a GM. It aims to demystify the job.<br/><br/>I can say more, but I'll wait until (a) I have the book in front of me again, and (b) the ball is rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311086/#Comment_311086" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T08:40:16+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  8:40AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Will.

I sat down and, over the course of a couple nights, read straight through the book.  It was an enjoyable read as a book.  I didn't feel like there were parts that could be skipped over, e.g. equipment lists in more traditional RPGs that tell you explicitly what is available in the setting.  Instead, a lot of the setting was implied - that drove my imagination crazy.  I'm also going to throw out that I liked the art, each piece looked like a real person and not a cookie-cutter artistic archetype with some stylized trappings to differentiate individuals - that helped keep me immersed in the text.   Lastly, I like the way the text talked to me, conversationally, rather than informed me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311099/#Comment_311099" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T09:15:23+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  9:15AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found <b>Moves Snowball</b>, p152-158, to be invaluable.

"Knowledge exists in the world" - Donald Norman.<br/><br/>Then the Moves indices - for when we're doing something we don't usually do.<br/><br/>Examples, examples, examples.  I usually learn game rules by induction from the examples rather than the rules themselves.<br/><br/>And, yeah, me, I like the conversational writing style, and the cussing.<br/><br/>And, I wrote a bunch about it on my blog - <a href="http://www.gamedevblog.com/2011/01/notes-on-apocalypse-world.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamedevblog.com/2011/01/notes-on-apocalypse-world.html</a> - but one relevant bit:<br/><br/>"Part of the fun is that half of the book is rules for the GM;  not guidelines, not advice, but rules.  The section on GMing begins:  "There are a million ways to GM games; Apocalypse World calls for one way in particular. This chapter is it. Follow these as rules. The whole rest of the game is built upon this."  The rules are a contract between GM and players, a contract where the GM is promising to deliver certain kinds of fun ... it has rules like Ask Provocative Questions And Build On The Answers.  Which means when I play Apocalypse World with anybody as the GM, I know the GM is going to ask me to contribute to the story and respect what I add (unless they're breaking the rules.)

The guy (I love Jonathan's narrator above, by the way) mentions something and I feel like I'm asking him to elaborate. Not like "huh," but like "go on..." And it <i>does </i>go on, but not too much. And when it does go on too much, it's because I didn't <i>get it</i> the first time.<br/><br/>I wish I could express this better. Sorry.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is more advanced than its peers because it explains its storytelling functions quickly and charmingly. Often, it explains the mechanics just with the names of the rules. The naming of the stats, the naming of the rules, the naming of the characters, NPCs, gear, powers, and all the other stuff: this requires such a tight economy of expression.

Fronts are so good.  Fronts are how a lot of good sandbox-y, player-driven games have been run (or, maybe, should have been run) ever since the dark ages of gaming. But AW lays them out clearly for what they are, puts clocks on them so you can think about how to pace those developments, tells you to be both a listener and a proactive manipulator in managing them in play, and that's way, WAY more explicit than any text I've read has ever done it.<br/><br/>Fronts have totally changed the way I think about running White Wolf games.  It makes them seem so much more managable and obvious.  They're affecting the way I think about running Freemarket (which I'm currently doing), even though that game calls for a slightly different approach.  I guess that's kind of a writing thing, because Vincent could have been far less explicit about Fronts, telling you to just make up some Fronts and "play your NPCs" without more explicit guidelines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311170/#Comment_311170" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T16:04:02+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  4:04PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are so many moments of awesome in the book, it made for several nights reading, just for enjoyment.

I don't have the capacity to properly imagine how the game rules would work out in play. This was true for other Vx games I read, Dogs and IAWA. With Apocalypse World, though, I didn't have to. The book provides enough examples and explanation for everything, so I could really visualize what gameplay looks like, and what kinds of stories it might create.<br/><br/>I know we're supposed to keep it positive, but one thing that I had some problem with is the list of threats. The threat types are presented only by their names, and while these names are great, I can't help but feel some of them are evocative for native speakers but not for me. This is one place where I really would've liked more examples. I only say this on this thread because if everything else hadn't been so well explained and examplified, explanations of each particular threat types wouldn't have been so amiss.<br/><br/>As a non-native speaker, I find the conversational style more difficult to read than a more formal style, but it's more rewarding, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311176/#Comment_311176" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T16:40:05+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  4:40PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The book is repetitive.

Take this to heart if/when you are laying out your own game, or somebody else's game, "and I am NOT fucking around here":<br/><br/>The body text is nice and readable, not fancy or anything. It looks distinctive enough that you know it's not Time New Roman, and it's not quite as familiar as Garamond or Minion (and let's be honest for a second: Garamond italics can look pretty fucking bad sometimes). It's a little bit different, and a lot familiar. Comfortable, readable, interesting, distinctive.<br/><br/>And then the header and title fonts are fucked up and scream post-apocalyptic destruction, burnt-out buildings and rusty blown-up cars. But they're not illegible. It might take a fraction of a second longer to read them, but they convey lots and lots of mood.<br/><br/>The moral:<br/><br/>1. Fuck around with your titles and headings. Maybe make them harder to read than in AW, as long as they broadcast what your game/book is all about.<br/><br/>2. Do NOT fuck around with the body text.

What I mean is that the digest format, the text layout and fonts, the conversational style and focused chapters / headings meant the book was unremarkable, yet tantalising in its iconography. The minimalist, block print art is consistent throughout and really entrenches the archetypes of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThor wrote a great piece on his blog about the power of a name, in conjuction with Jared's descriptive 'rule of three'. AW uses these concepts throughout. Everything must be named and described simply and evocatively. All you need is a name and a few descriptors and you have a great skeletal frame to hang the fiction on. This process is also encouraged to be a group activity via the principle of  'asking lots of questions'. Players can be adressed to encourage them to narratively contribute and roleplay. This is awesome. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a list of names and tags and conditions and small (consistent) mechanical effects re-inforces the 'prescriptive and descriptive' nature of the rules (and roleplay in general). I am amazed at how purposefully identifying the processes we as story gamers have been doing for ages and hard coding them in such an effective and simple way has galvanised play. Its right there in the rules and it makes no pretentions of being anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love how the game pays homage to 'classes and levels' without using such misappropriated jargon. The specificity focuses the player's fiction, enjoying what makes their exclusive character so badass, rather than the 'optimal build'.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with most story games, the mechanical iteration of conflict via moves is consistent across all conflict. Fighting is no different to fucking or finding luxe at the market. I've found that players invariably want to 'try-out' moves, so its a great facilitation tool to have the narrational outcomes right there on the sheet, and all in the relatively same format.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fluidity of time scale without 'turn, rounds or seconds' is so refreshing and liberating. Normally I find the slavish tenacity of these segments so 'wargamey'. AW skirts around this with the excellent paradigm of to do it - do it. The moves snowball back and forth and naturally escalate the fiction to a reprise. Brilliant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reward cycle uses tried and true story game entaglements betwixt player, character, relationship and selective improvement. This is succinct, easy and satisfying to both player and MC. The temptation as always is to complicate and create endless improvements or advanced moves, but the rules, despite giving you the leeway to do so, encourage a trust in Vx to play as written, explore the playbooks and develop your unique fictional vision of AW using the same rules as everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really, really have been converted to the 'Miss, 7-9, 10+' Move format. So simple yet so deep. The possibilities come through the fictional 'openess' of the statistcally common 7-9 result. 'You succeed, but with complications' is the source of all great roleplay. It engenders a play to see what happens style, backed by the specific prep encourages through the fronts and threats.<br/>\n<br/>\nFronts and threats require the MC to focus on their craft. Purposefully avoiding plot development, rather focusing on NPC motivations and how they can directly threaten the characters. Nothing new here, but the format is surprisingly specific. Countdown clocks reinforce this tension with a fluid time pressure, and the idea of 'putting NPCs in crosshairs' was so disturbing to me as MC, yet so refreshingly obvious in play, and allowed for far greater focus on the PCs (as any story game should).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Principles are a fine condensation of vast tomes on 'gamemastery'. This makes the role of MC approachable, achievable and evocative. It also highlights the difference between the players and their power of 'rolling the dice'. Sure as MC you can choose any hard move you'd like, but the players.... The players have the power of deciding chance (as they do their moves) to send the story in another direction indeed. Heady Stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the system is the epitome of hackable, and Vx gives you the tools to do so. Exemplary form dear boy. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311341/#Comment_311341" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T09:34:29+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  9:34AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2011 9:36AM by Jim_Crocker.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone else has touched on most Of the stuff I like about the game, and in particular the way it systematically spells out as Principles a bunch of GM techniques Ive been using without understudying them as specific techniques. <br/><br/>It may be silly, but I have to say one of the things that I find immensely appealing that Ive never seen before and wouldn't have ever thought to do in a million years is the tri-fold character sheets.

They don't have to buy the book, they don't have to pirate the book, they just need a printed out character sheet.  I feel like that will, in the long run, result in more people buying the physical book and fewer people pirating it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaochou" title="chaochou"><img alt="chaochou" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaochou">chaochou</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311361/#Comment_311361" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T14:47:24+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  2:47PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been looking through AW again specifically to try and answer this question, and it's really hard to nail something specific down. I like the fonts, I like the graphic design.. I like the artwork the way it looks a bit lo-tech. When I first read through AW I really appreciated the conversational tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also think certain things are really, exceptionally well done. Like this description of the battlebabe: "You mistake looking at them for falling in love, and you get too close and it's a zillion volts and your wings burn off like paper."<br/>\n<br/>\nA line like that could come straight out of Neuromancer. That could be The Finn describing Molly, no question. So irrespective of whether the style is your thing, I think AW contains some top writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I loved the character sheets. Before I bought the game I was reading the character sheet pdfs on the website. What I found interesting was having read those, I found reading the rulebook was almost like confirmation of how to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some bits that added a new dimension - like fronts and threats. And I couldn't guess what Hx was before I bought the book. But tags like 'close, area, messy' - I don't think the rules really add anything much apart from reassurance that you're doing it right. How to handle moves, how they're structured - it's there on the sheet. The rules add a bit of depth, but again they confirm what you know. I felt a lot of the game was like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313352/#Comment_313352" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-19T11:42:10+00:00" title="February 19, 2011 11:42AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Equipment tags.

I love it how he spills stuff out in lists: here's names, eyes, what the stats are about. Lists are enough. It's what you get. Pick.
