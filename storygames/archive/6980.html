I have various design notes <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/category/games/roleplaying-games/flowers-for-mara-development-and-playtest/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In addition, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2q_RHR1j78" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a rough trailer that I've put together, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5bVs3WccBc&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a sample of play from a test run back in January.<br/><br/>This game is in the tradition of Jeepform LARPing, which means that there's lots of walking around and very little mechanical interaction within a scene. (Almost all the mechanics are dedicated to scene structuring.) It also has a Grief mechanic, which basically says that the only way for your character to overcome his grief is for you to share one of your own Griefs with the rest of the group. It's all very powerful in play, and it works wonderfully...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...and I have <i>no</i> idea how to sell this thing at GenCon. I'm at the Forge booth, which is demo-focused, which is very cool and all. However, I'm not persuaded that a 15-minute demo would actually capture what is nifty about this game. Even worse, I'd be afraid that it would make the game look silly. "So, it's time for a scene. Um, talk to each other for a while. Yeah, that's good."<br/><br/>The one idea that I have right now is to focus on a Family Gathering (as seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PUFkVTd8ao" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BFGNg0UwBk" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Essentially, the family gathers for a holiday of some sort, and the game cuts back and forth from the meal to soliloquies delivered by the characters to express their inner thoughts at the time. Working this inner/outer action could make for a workable demo....<br/><br/>So, anyways, I'm turning to the Internet for help and assistance.

The fun isn't all in the nifty mechanics, so what do you showcase?   <br/><br/>Doing a family gathering seems like a good way to approach it.  This gives the players a scene with handy conflicts and hooks that they can dig their teeth into for 10 minutes or so. Plus an internal monologue or two.  And there is a certain amount of character creation, isn't there? I wonder which would be better: handing the players pre-made characters with juicy conflicts to play out part of the family gathering scene, or letting them make up something on their own to bring in their own creativity.   <br/><br/>Also, running the game in a standard con-slot is probably a good idea too--I wonder if we can get together a few of our jeep hybrids, and make a showing.  We might get a good turn out from the larpers and turn on a new market to the games. <br/><br/>best,<br/>Emily                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155385/#Comment_155385" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T09:02:47+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  9:02AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2008 9:04AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you do succeed, do tell us how you did it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155392/#Comment_155392" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T09:19:52+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  9:19AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>And there is a certain amount of character creation, isn't there?

Have 2- and 3- player versions on hand maybe.<br/><br/>When it is done, you can talk about jeepform and how they just did it, and how that's what Mara is all about.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155407/#Comment_155407" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T09:48:13+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  9:48AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2008 9:48AM by Moreno R..">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu, Gencon isn't like Modcon, where people have a lot of time to play.

The point of a demo is to showcase the features of a game such that the audience understand what the *potential* experience of the game is.<br/><br/>The key feature of "A Flower for Mara", to me, is that it is NOT simply a scenario for free form role-playing (my less charitable self calls this socializing while pretending to be someone else; my mean spirited self calls this in-character yattering).  It is very much a game, with rules and a structure and a point.<br/><br/>So to me the demo should (a) show that a structure exists (b) shows how the structure limits and informs play such that the game is not just "free form" and (c) hints at without necessarily delivering the full experience.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155522/#Comment_155522" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T18:18:04+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  6:18PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everybody, I'm surprised that <i><b>any </b></i>games can be demonstrated at all in such an environment, and in such a short time!

Educating them is only one possible tool in pursuit of the goal:  The goal is to let people experience why they desperately, slaveringly, <b>need</b> to play this game, and then to say "So, can I ring you up?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practical terms:  It looks to me like the fun of this game is going to be 90% <i>anticipation</i> ... knowing that you've got this Grief simmering inside of you, just waiting to bust loose, and savoring the feeling of restraining it.  If people like that feeling then they'll want your game, if they don't then they won't.  That sound about right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd think that what you need to demonstrate is character creation:  Make them create their own wonderful, horrible, juicy, agonizing Griefs.  Praise them for how wonderful said Griefs are (or, if they're not wonderful enough yet that you can honestly praise, <i>push them</i> to make it better ... they know it's lame too).  Then make them invent the reasons they would keep those Griefs hidden.  Then give a general sketch of a heart-rending scene that accents those Griefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, when they can feel the anticipation building inside of them, but before they get to roleplay a word, you say "And that's the demo.  I hope it gave you a feel for what the game is about."<br/>\n<br/>\nHow's that sound?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155623/#Comment_155623" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T08:44:37+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  8:44AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just popping in briefly to say that all the ideas are really helpful.

The one thing is that the Grief is a real-life actual thing that happened to the player. So the process of writing that down isn't a creative process as much as it's a...hmm...confessional process?
