His brother Oswald is a self-taught mage who has a book of magic written by an enchanter from the sunken kingdom, and who sealed a spirit of Chaos beneath the earth with the help of Killian the young woodsman. Killian is an orphan who never lost at chess, and carries a magic greatsword he found in a lightning-cleft rowan. He also spent a lot of time in the garden of Delaney the witch, with Delaney's son and prentice Pwyll. Delaney is now hiding, working on something secret, and left Pwyll a crystal that can light his way.<br/><br/>Weird things started happening in Tywyn lately. People are falling in love in bizarre pairings all over the village, horses were found on the roofs of their stables, and the Wild Hunt rode through the village last night (\xc6dred the would be knight managed to dismount one of them, and took his antlered helm as a trophy before the fae rider managed to escape!). Oswald the mage saw a vision of Delaney the witch in his beer, and became convinced that she was somehow at the root of the fae's anger.<br/><br/>As our heroes were preparing to mount an expedition beyond the Wall, Pwyll's cousin Rhiannon started giving birth! Pwyll had a fight with her over her infatuation with No-Water Wesley, the village drunk, just hours ago and she wasn't even pregnant! Luckily, Pwyll had learned well from Delaney, and managed to deliver baby Arianrhod, and several other oddly timed newborns throughout the village. The fury of the fae had to be dealth with before it threw all of Tywyn into Chaos!<br/><br/>On the way to the Wall, the heroes met a fairy embassy riding towards Tywyn. Seeing \xc6dred's antlered helm, the fae herald assumed that the would-be knight is the village champion and challenged him to a joust. \xc6dred first shattered the herald's shield and then dismounted him, without taking a scratch himself, upon which the herald respectfully requested to take the heroes to discuss the feud with fairies' Ogre King.<br/><br/>The Ogre King's bride-to-be, lovely Lurulu was missing. The patterns of the stars, and the eddies of the rivers, and the colours of the leaves pointed to Tywyn (similar to Oswald's beer), and the Ogre King, though kindly by nature, was furious. Despite knowing that even casual offers or vague promises carry the strength of mighty oaths in the Ogre King's realm, \xc6dred promised to return Lurulu to the King, awing the Fairy Court with his confidence.<br/><br/>Using Pwyll's crystal to guide their way, the heroes set off through the fairy forest, but found their path blocked by a three-legged sphinx. This being the fairy realm, where they put the cart before the horse, instead of posing a riddle, the sphinx demanded to be posed riddles by each of the heroes before letting them press on, deeper into the forest, where the trees were gnarled and bare and infested with gray lichens, and barely seen things slither through the black ooze that covers the ground.<br/><br/>At the heart of this decay, the heroes came upon an ancient standing stone. At its foot lay an achingly beautiful maiden, and a cloaked figure was at some sinister work above her. "Delaney!" cried \xc6dred, and indeed, Delaney the witch, turned and pulled down her hood!<br/><br/>Pwyll tried to approach and speak with his mother, but as Delaney clawed the air, so the trees and roots clawed at our heroes and held them in place. "Away! Away with you before it is too late, you should not see this!" screamed Delaney. "See what?" demanded Pwyll as he commanded the plants back with the power he learned from Delaney herself. "I will take her place, I will be his bride, I will be the Queen of Air and Darkness, and rule both realms!" Delaney cackled as a band of malformed goblins and a swarm of biting, stinging insects all descended on our heroes.<br/><br/>Fighting through the goblins and pushing past Delaney, \xc6dred came upon a grisly sight: the elf maiden's chest open, her heart cut out, and a perfect sphere of crystal, throbbing with light, still bloody, cradled in her hands. He returned the crystal to her chest, and then Pwyll was there, and a blow from his shillelagh knocked Delaney out, but the grasping trees, and the grinning goblins, and the stinging insects, and the poisonous swamp, had delayed the heroes too much: the crystal's light throbbed once, twice more, and was still.<br/><br/>The heroes returned lovely Lurulu's body to the mourning Fairy Court, fulfilling \xc6dred promise. The forest itself cried for her, leaves which were green yesterday suddenly autumn-dry and falling like tears. At the Ogre King's command, the ghastly riders of the Wild Hunt took Delaney, still unconscious, off into the sky and a fate unknown. The Ogre King, devastated as he was, had to honour his own promise of friendship for a year and a day with the people of Tywyn.<br/><br/>But a new quest might be in store for our heroes: two other elven princesses were lost, and there's an archway of trees that can lead to distant lands when the winds are right, and if there three were reunited, there might still be hope for lost Lurulu...<br/><br/>We left off with the four heroes silhouetted against the tree portal, pondering whether to go back to their lives in Tywyn, or to follow the Ogre King's quest even further... beyond the Wall!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445178/#Comment_445178" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-10T12:21:03+00:00" title="May 10, 2015 12:21PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This turned out quite lengthy, but I wanted to emphasize how much had happened in a single moderatly long session, and that each scene and most of the detail was prompted by the game itself.<br/><br/>Going through the same scenario again might not be quite as fresh as doing it for the first time, but with at least 6 options for each of a dozen or so tables, even reusing the same scenario within a single campaign is feasible, making Beyond the Wall a true treasure for no prep D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445180/#Comment_445180" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-10T15:20:57+00:00" title="May 10, 2015  3:20PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is Beyond the Wall?
