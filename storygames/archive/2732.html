The game gives mechanical support for expressing your opinion of others, and for seeking their opinions in return.  So I don't have that "outside the system" feeling when I'm doing that kind of thing for the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's the thing:  Expressing things about <i>yourself</i> proves to be pretty bad strategy in those terms.  Expressing your dreams for the future does not, in fact, change people's opinions about you.  I've tried it, and ... it just doesn't.  People make up their mind about you based on the things you do that <i>aren't</i> aimed at them.  You can't change that by expressing yourself to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo <b><i>why do we do it</i></b>?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we really must do it ... I'm finding that I'm taking time and effort to make up secrets and then reveal them, even though it's getting me nothing in mechanical terms.  My instincts for a good story absolutely demand it, and now I'm trying to deconstruct my instincts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne obvious thing is exposition:  Characters share truths with other characters because it helps the audience be in the know.  But the same thing can be achieved with an internal monologue, so I don't think that's the <i>necessary</i> factor here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I think the thing is this:  Telling someone else a secret is a great big honking flag about a <b>change in your relationship with that person</b>.  By revealing something that you wouldn't reveal to just anyone, you show that a person is not "just anyone."<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kare_Kano" rel="nofollow">Kare Kano</a> time:  Arima tells Miyazawa that he is adopted ... and <i>goes on</i> to tell her that his birth parents were scum-bags, and that he has spent his life desperately terrified that if he isn't perfect <b>every damn second</b> he'll turn out to be just like them, and hurt the adoptive parents that he loves so very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n'scuse me ... Give me a second.  &gt;sniffle&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I'm back.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point (before I got all teary) is this:  Yes, that's a sad, sad story ... but if I learn it all through flashbacks and internal monologues and stuff then, frankly, my response is only a fraction of what it could be.  What grips me is that Arima <b>tells someone</b>.  What must it cost him to say those words to another human being?  And, therefore, <i>how much must he love her</i> to make her the only person he ever reveals that part of himself to?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can totally play a character that never does that.  In fact, I would argue that <b>every PC I can think of</b> tells their story without flagging their relationships this way ... because we, as roleplayers, are horrifically, abyssmally bad at using this kind of revelation properly.  I cannot remember <b>ever</b> having seen it done well.  We rely almost entirely on other flagging techniques (for instance, showing that a relationship has evolved by the <i>choices</i> that a character makes).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I realized that, I said to myself "Okay, so what kind of character do you get when you choose never to single a person out to confide in?"  My response:  "A lonely one."  We play very, very lonely characters ... even in the midst of proven family and friends.  Isn't that strange.<br/>\n<br/>\nI genuinely do think that it's just a technique thing.  Certainly, before I started thinking hard about this, I would never have thought to use a revelation in precisely that way.  I wonder if all that's needed is to make a little mechanic that points out to people "Hey, if you're feeling strongly toward this person then you probably want to confide something difficult about yourself to them."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62444/#Comment_62444" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T09:55:52+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  9:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have seen it happen, done well, a very, very few times, and always in the context of an Amber game, and only among players who had been playing together for a very long time... more than a year of nearly weekly sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62447/#Comment_62447" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T10:00:03+00:00" title="March 29, 2007 10:00AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony,<br><br>Sharing a secret also makes you vulnerable.

He doesn't gain any mechanical advantage in doing so.  The Player who is told the secret gets a some sort of advantage in an immediate conflict they are having.  I'm thinking something along the lines of Bob is reallys struggling with his relationship with his parents, so Fred opens up to him and tells him about his abusive parents and how he understands Bob's position.  Bob then gets a bonus in dealing with his parental issues because he feels someone understands and cares.  However, Bob also gets a token of some sort that can be used as a bonus only against Fred in a future conflict.  This represents Fred's vulnerability to Bob since he shared a secret.<br><br>Thus, sharing a secret is of little value to the person sharing the secret except it helps his friend out but it is of some value to the person being told the secret.  The person getting the real value just doesn't ever get to make the call on whether or not the secret gets revealed.<br><br>Admittedly this would need to be tweeked.

Neither of them is trying to build trust. In the generals' case, the secret is "positive": Revealing the secret makes you sound well-connected, in the know, and powerful, so there's a strong desire to get it out there to impress other people. In the criminals' case, the secret is (usually) "negative": Revealing the secret will probably make people think less of you, but concealing it is outright painful, and there's a strong desire to get it out there so you can stop worrying about other people finding out and just get it over with, and maybe get some sympathy as well. The "you can't handle the truth!" scene from <i>A Few Good Men</i> is a classic example that hybridizes both of these: The protagonist's crucial insight is that the officer he's prosecuting <i>wants</i> to say he committed the crime in question because he's proud of having done it.<br><br>The relationship between the person telling the secret and the person hearing it is utterly secondary to the internal psychological tension within the person struggling over whether to keep the secret or tell it. In the sentence, "let me tell you a secret," the "tell you" aspect is far less important than the "let me." <i>The primary reason people tell secrets is to relieve internal psychological pressure.</i> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheCzech" title="TheCzech"><img alt="TheCzech" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheCzech">TheCzech</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62581/#Comment_62581" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T11:39:40+00:00" title="March 30, 2007 11:39AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2007 11:40AM by TheCzech.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sydney, you are not talking about the same thing.

Keeping a secret ... even one that nobody is asking about or has any clue about ... is hard emotional work.  It ties people up in knots.  Revealing the secret (whether to one person or to the world) is a relief.  People want to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Sydney, I think that you're wrong that the relationship is secondary.  You're deliberately picking some extreme "any port in a storm" situations ... criminals confessing their crimes, etc.  Those are people who can no longer be discriminate, no longer choose who they reveal themselves to.  In most cases, people are under less intense (but usually longer-lasting) pressure ... they will wait years (or a lifetime) to find the one person they can share a secret with.  They will bear the burden of the secret far beyond any reasonable limits.  That's why the right relationship can be so powerful ... it can let you release a tension you've held so long that it's become a part of you, as unconscious as breathing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, as Eric says, that a secret shared with the world ceases to be a secret (and should cease to have any lasting mechanical effects).  It's the secrets shared with just one or two people that make the difference ... those secrets show that you view those people as importantly different from everyone else.  It shows that they are <i>special</i> to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider this situation:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Amy tells Brett that she' wants to be a police officer, even though she's small and wiry.<br/>\nBrett feels valued and special, being in her confidence this way.<br/>\nBrett supports Amy as she secretly takes steps toward her dream.<br/>\nAmy wins a Judo tournament, surprising everyone (<i>except</i> Brett)<br/>\nPeople think of Amy as a tough girl now.  She reveals her dream of being a police officer, and now many people support her.<br/>\nBrett feels <i>lessened</i> now that everybody knows Amy's dreams.  He shares no secret with her.  He's no longer special.</div>\n</blockquote>\nGoing public with a secret doesn't have to hurt people because of the contents of the secret.  Sometimes the contents of the secret are, actually, pretty good ... "I love you" is a classic secret, for instance.  But going public is always going to hurt in some sense, because it destroys the private little <i>t\xc3\xaate-a-t\xc3\xaate</i> of a secret shared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62596/#Comment_62596" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T15:40:23+00:00" title="March 30, 2007  3:40PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish I had a better sense of which <i>piece</i> of this phenomenon is the right place to "stick the wedge in", rules-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could have rules where a secret that you're hiding from everyone is a sort of two-sided Key ... one which lets you do seemingly nonsensical things (motivated by the secret) and simultaneously gain both power in the story and more tension driving you to reveal the secret.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, you could have rules where a secret that you've shared with someone else is the fundamental thing:  maybe a source of income that you profit from whenever the person you confided in acts in a certain way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, you could have the threat of public revelation be the major mechanical factor, so that the act of revealing a secret is a second-order mechanical effect ... one which changes the landscape by giving people new options and responsibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I feel like I'm not giving anyone enough directon to make the thread a productive one ... nobody's called me on the whole "What the heck are you <b>looking for</b> in this thread?" thing, but I'm very conscious of the fact that they <i>could</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I'm looking for in the thread is a good sense of what I should be looking for in the thread :-)  The right questions are so much harder to come by than the right answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62607/#Comment_62607" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T18:15:18+00:00" title="March 30, 2007  6:15PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, there's this whole thing with revealing secrets, where it fosters intimacy between the person revealing the secret and the person receiving the secret.<br>\n<br>\nFollowing that track, revealing secrets could be tied to building a relationship while at the same time introducing problematic elements into the game space.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
