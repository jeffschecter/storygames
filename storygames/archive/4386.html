We call it a "post-human RPG," and see it as a short-form cyberpunk-technohorror mashup. Like <b>Ganakagok</b>, it uses a specially constructed deck to provide narrative motifs, but the play of the game involves characters trapped in a cyberpunk keeping-up-with-the-Joneses rat/arms race while the world around them careens wildly out of control:\n<blockquote><i>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a dark future where the boundaries between human and machine have become . . . blurry. Like the lady said: We are all cyborgs now. Brain links, bionic limbs, and personality chips have joined plastic surgery as "normal" parts of human life, no more extraordinary than eyeglasses.<br/><br/>But now we know what happens when your body is more machine than flesh. The shrinks give it names: psychosocial holism disintegration (PHD), or dysphoric post-human maladaptation syndrome: Merry DyPHMaS, doc. Back on the block, out in the street, we have other names. Cyborg fever. Mod-madness. Chip-o-phrenia. Technolust. But it all means the same thing: the more you mod, the more you need to mod.<br/><br/>And the technolust jones can drive cyberdaddies and moddie-mamas to disturbing, even gruesome extremes. The buzzing heads and the crawling newsfeeds in the media spout statistics about rising crime rates and disintegrating families. The edutainment blogs tell sensationalistic stories about mod-mad tweens selling their kid siblings' organs for cybernetic upgrades, and the hyperextreme sports portals feature live feeds of 24/7 steel-knuckle cage matches between cyborg fighters on cognitive autopilot. The old-line body puritans--we call them \xe2\u20ac\u0153meatheads\xe2\u20ac\x9d--use words like \xe2\u20ac\u0153perverse\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153blasphemous\xe2\u20ac\x9d to describe the new cyborg culture. But some radical New Age geeks preach that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s all a sign that the Singularity is near, and soon humanity will move to a new level of machine-enabled higher consciousness.<br/><br/>The meatheads, for their part, mock the cyber-Rapture as just another symptom of the hallucinatory delirium that is known to be just another side effect of too-extensive body modification. And--who knows?--maybe they're right.<br/><br/>It's a clear case of the center cannot hold. Society is coming apart, fragmenting into splinters, and we're PHDling while Rome burns. What rough beast comes slouching toward Bethlehem? You and me, baby. You and me.</i><br/><br/>In Omega Point, you play a citizen of this slowly disintegrating world. The struggle for survival is harsh, and the competition is fierce, and it may be pushing you to do things that would make you blush--or maybe turn white as a sheet--if you were thinking straight. Can you hold on to your humanity when all around you everyone else is surrendering theirs?</blockquote>\nWe playtested a version of it at last year's Dreamation, and the nicest part was the rule that let you avoid a game-mechanical penalty by roleplaying the specific kind of madness associated with the suit of the card you'd played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98940/#Comment_98940" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T09:27:12+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  9:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 9:31AM by Valvorik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Toronto Indie RPG group might be best one to hook up with, run by the mighty Eric W, as they focus on alternative games<br/><a href="http://epweissengruber.livejournal.com/profile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://epweissengruber.livejournal.com/profile</a><br/><br/>The Toronto Roleplayers meetup is another to try:<br/><a href="http://roleplayers.meetup.com/95/?gj=sj6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://roleplayers.meetup.com/95/?gj=sj6</a><br/><br/>The indie group makes use space at Ryerson University downtown fairly frequently (quite close to Eaton Centre and the Dominion Centre mentioned).<br/><br/>Where abouts is the conference being held?<br/><br/>Though, that weekend is our Thanksgiving up here, Monday's a holiday, so being a long weekend folks might have plans.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98952/#Comment_98952" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T10:56:22+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 10:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Rob.

Along with their existing collections and exhibits.<br/><br/>The Art Gallery Of Ontario (AGO) is also within 40 minutes walking distance and has a sizeable gallery of Henry Moore pieces; unfortunately, they're still undergoing a long reconstruction project so their ongoing collection is not widely viewable (there are, however, still lots of pieces worth seeing).<br/><br/>There are a number of game/comic shops that are within a reasonable walk from the downtown area:<br/>- Silver Snail (on Queen, mostly comics) -- this is a hike from your hotel, probably almost an hour<br/>- Game Trek (in Royal York Hotel plaza, huge selection of boardgames, a bit pricey), even farther, probably 80 to 90 min walk<br/>- Hairy Tarantula (354 Yonge, upstairs, decent prices and big stock, boardgames and rolegames, weird owners/staff), probably a half an hour walk<br/>- 401 Convenient Games &amp; Toys (401 Yonge, old smoke/quickie store converted into a game store, good prices, not much selection of boardgames), maybe 40 minutes walk<br/><br/>Worlds Biggest Bookstore (a bit of a shadow of its former self) is also within walking distance, and is probably comparable to a big Borders or Waldenbooks in scope of catalog; again, about 40 minutes walk<br/><br/>The good news is that you're a five minute walk to one of the main subway system junctions, and can take a subway to nearby any of these locations, if you prefer transit to walking. Walking around in downtown Toronto is quite safe, though, and you can get a much better feel for the downtown if you walk.<br/><br/>Codicil -- there are a number of small and fairly nice restaurants near the AGO, around Beverley/Baldwin/McCaul street, that I discovered when I had a stint in Robin Laws' gaming group. Not really convenient to your hotel, but will almost certainly be cheaper than the restaurants in nearby Yorkville.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98974/#Comment_98974" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T11:40:28+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:40AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Hairy Tarantula is the weirdest game shop I've ever been to, and that's saying a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98975/#Comment_98975" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T11:40:50+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:40AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!
