That\u2019s an interesting question. The game I played right before Hero\u2019s Banner was a roleplaying-intense iteration of first edition Stormbringer, and so I was very much into \u201cget into my character\u201d mode when we sat down for the game. After my first scene, I was thinking about how Teodor would solve various practical problems presented by the first scene \u2013 all the stuff you have to plan out in many other RPGs. Like, when you want to kill the king, you scope out the castle, hire some trusted NPCs, maybe call in a favor from a wizard you helped a few years back, then you sneak into the castle, cast invisibility to get past the sentries, kill the troll bodyguard outside the king\u2019s chambers, and then finally confront the king in his chambers.<br/><br/>Hero\u2019s Banner isn\u2019t really designed for play at that level of detail, despite some text to the contrary on pp. 59-60 (about which more presently). If there were trolls in the Cross \u2013 there are some spooky demons who seem to be corrupted people of some kind, and some unpredictable miracles, but no fey or monsters of the classical variety, though probably those elements could be added around the fringes without damaging the setting if you like that sort of thing \u2013 you\u2019d probably go straight from the scene where you made the decision that you had to kill the king to the scene where you\u2019re standing in the doorway with the dead troll behind you, your beloved sister standing between you and the king trying to stop you from carrying out your murderous deed. I think the best way to play this game, and the way our GM ran it, is just to push from one critical scene to another, to play out one scene where you have to embody an Influence and make a difficult choice, and then move on to the next one.<br/><br/>And so when Teodor moved straight from the frosty riverbank to his uncle\u2019s church, with a beautiful and intelligent cousin who might make a suitable wife at the table, I was pretty disoriented. Wait a minute! something inside me screamed. I had to recon to my castle to get some extra men, and send a message over here, and\u2026 instead I\u2019m here in this new scene. This is very disorienting.<br/><br/>Was my immersion broken? Some have opined that the word \u2018immersion\u2019 is ambiguous, but I\u2019m not convinced: I think it\u2019s the word \u2018break\u2019 that\u2019s ambiguous in this question at least. Immersion was broken for me in the sense that it was interrupted, but it was not broken in the sense that my character just became a token in a story-construction machine, or that I was prevented from identifying with him because I was distracted by mechanical or metagame considerations during play. In fact, scene-level conflict resolution of the kind you find in a game like Hero\u2019s Banner or My Life with Master means that while I\u2019m in scene, I can totally bust it freestyle, I\u2019m liberated to play my character just the way I see him in my head and react to what the GM tells me is going on around me, which is very immersive, and very cool. I had to mentally readjust to the new context, but within a few minutes I was OK in the new scene, and deeply imaginatively and emotionally involved in what Teodor was doing in the new scene.<br/><br/>I think the question of how immersive a game this is ultimately is one of how jarring you find these scene-shifts, how easily you drop back in after pulling out, and how comfortable you are playing through the highly charged points of a character\u2019s life without spending much time on the stuff in between. I\u2019m OK with it, and for that reason I\u2019m enjoying it, even if there\u2019s times where I could wish for longer-term seamless identification with my character, and places where I\u2019d just like a down-time scene to establish my character a little and get comfortable with how he feels. On the other hand, if you really can\u2019t stand the breaks or need to deal with the smaller stuff to enjoy your role immersion, you\u2019ll probably have to play Hero\u2019s Banner one-on-one with a GM who\u2019s equally interested in lingering over the details, or some other game entirely. Different people have different preferences here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243876/#Comment_243876" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T13:21:50+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  1:21PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So as I understand the article, the author suggests that the only reason "immersion" is broken is due to discontinuity of action.<br/><br/>But I would find that it's broken by any arbitrary resolution of a conflict that, to me, seemed in doubt. That is, if I were sort of a Brutus with the King's implicit trust, then telescoping straight from formulation of the intent to the moment of execution makes perfect sense. If the overall situation suggested on the other hand that there were real obstacles to reaching that moment, then it's highly anti-immersive to pick the confrontation with the king just because that's the most dramatic scene to frame within the possibilities suggested by the overall conflict.<br/><br/>But you could still telescope quite a bit by framing broadly and using scene-level resolution (possibly with an extended mechanic like Bringing Down the Pain in TSoY). The focus is still on the fundamental intent but you aren't short-shrifting all the other elements of the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_243928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243928/#Comment_243928" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-27T03:01:08+00:00" title="November 27, 2009  3:01AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>If the overall situation suggested on the other hand that there were real obstacles to reaching that moment, then it's highly anti-immersive to pick the confrontation with the king just because that's the most dramatic scene to frame within the possibilities suggested by the overall conflict.</blockquote>As I see it, the author of the article (I could not find his name there) presents a pretty convincing argument to the contrary.

But I have found "immersion in rapturous description" consistent with "telling a story."<br/><br/>As so many others have said, if we focus on the kind of play that creates the particular kind of immersion we have the most familiarity with, we'll come up with as many different immersions as people who say anything on the subject. But I think if we focus on the experience of immersion itself, rather than what we get immersed in, we'll see a lot of fruitful similarities, which can tell us a lot about how to create a more immersive experience.<br/><br/>Perhaps it says something about the average gamer that everyone seems to want to complicate the issue of "immersion" in games, and catalog all the things that don't count. I don't think anyone would ever get a classical piano recital mixed up with a pick-up game of basketball, yet we can identify the similarities of "flow" experiences in those two activities. Yet, it's somehow controversial to suggest that something already that broad could encompass the comparatively close activities of portraying a character in an RPG, and telling a story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244010/#Comment_244010" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-27T20:39:33+00:00" title="November 27, 2009  8:39PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2009 8:41PM by Arminius.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, you seem to be saying that just because the term "immersion" gets used for multiple, quite distinct experiences, then getting any one of them right moves you closer to solving all the others.

I could call it "creating a fiction", of course, but my main point is the same: a lot of gamers are "broken in" with one kind of creating their fiction, and have problems when they are given methods which produce fictions in other ways, and different fictions too.Good luck with that.<br/><br/>I've reflected a bit on Calithena's article, and actually I agree that "skipping ahead to the most dramatic part" is less anti-immersive than a lot of other techniques. It is a bit railroady because it entails having the GM very obviously steering you into a situation that may not arise completely naturally; it's <i>possible</i> that the scene could arise from the PC's intent, but it isn't really credible that such a scene will arise, every time. I suppose this depends on the GM's skill. Conceivably the GM could just as easily have chosen/decided that killing the king would be routine and instead fast-forwarded to the PC dealing with the political aftermath (trying to justify the regicide to the nobles). A sort of "leading with the ficton" and then just focusing the high points.<br/><br/>In any case I'd agree that aggressive scene-framing can be consistent with "immersion" subject to the caveat in the preceding paragraph. It's a lot harder to square techniques that require the player to make decisions using (in Forge terms) Author or Director stance in the middle of the action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244068/#Comment_244068" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-28T15:00:37+00:00" title="November 28, 2009  3:00PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite><br/>And Tomas, "playing a story" doesn't help.

But it does provide a good starting point, so, going down his list in the article...\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Turku: Immersion is an essential part of role-playing. The goal is to become the character, to experience everything through the character. Most of the ex-pression takes part inside the participants\u2019 heads.</blockquote>\nSo, the goal is to become the character. To lose your sense of self in the pursuit of channeling the character, feeling what the character feels, and seeing the world as the character sees the world.\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Locus of engagement: Immersion describes what area of the game players choose to engage with. Thus, players can immerse in - engage with - their character; the game world; the system; strategy; story; drama; theme; or social interaction. (Another term, \u201csocket\u201d, seems to be equivalent to \u201clocus of engagement\u201d).</blockquote>\nI don't see where this really address immersion at all; rather, it just says that you can immerse yourself in one of any number of things.\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Internal factors: Immersion is an internal state of mind, made up of three things: Processes, performance and sensations. Processes are thoughts and decisions that facilitate immersion; performance is what you do while immersed (such as think in character, easily describe aspects of the world etc); and sensations are what you experience - emotionally and physiologically - while immersed.</blockquote>\nTo me, this seems like a repeat of what "turku" meant by definition, only it tries to break immersion down into component experiences. I don't have any strong opinion on those components, just that it seems perfectly compatible with "turku."\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Flow: Immersion is the same as flow - the feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfilment. Flow can be experienced during play, sports, music and many other activities.</blockquote>\nI agree with this, but let's look at what this actually means. Flow means you lose a sense of yourself, and get completely wrapped up in the activity. How does this differ from "turku" or "internal factors"? It also seems to complement "sockets" quite well, since we already know that we experience flow in so many different areas, "sockets" just tells us what kind of activities in a game we might experience flow in.\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Channelling: Immersion is allowing the character to express itself through the player. The character is seen as a semi-autonomous entity residing in the player\u2019s mind, with a personality and will of its own.</blockquote>\nI don't know how this differs from "turku."\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Situation immersion: Feeling as if you\u2019re in the story, not necessarily the character.</blockquote>\nJust another socket, right?\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Trance: A state where the player is in a suggestible frame of mind.</blockquote>\nFollowing the source on this, "contracycle" on the Forge (I don't know his/her real name) says later, "In this regard I think I can see what the Turku school are getting it; they are actively seeking this mode." From everything s/he writes in that Forge thread, it seems like s/he doesn't use "trance" in any technical sense, but more like a generally altered state of consciousness. In fact, s/he expressly acknowledges that it seems very much the same as "turku." I couldn't find much more discussion about it than that, so it seems like "trance" means something very much like flow\u2014the altered state of consciousness where you lose your sense of yourself, and immerse yourself in the character.\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Character attachment: Having a personal, emotional attachment to the characters.</blockquote>\nYou actually could make the argument that this one <em>does</em> differ from the others. Personal, emotional attachments do not require any altered state of consciousness, however mild, nor any loss of your sense of self, nor any complete absorption in the activity at hand. In that, I think it might diverge a bit from the common meaning of immersion, "to engage wholly or deeply; absorb." But, I would argue that this only makes for a <em>wider</em> definition of immersion, something even wider than flow. I don't know how you could immerse in a character <em>without</em> some personal or emotional attachment to the character, so this seems more like a prerequisite to me.\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>Catharsis, kairosis or kenosis: Adapted from literary theory. In cathartic play, the player feels as if he himself undergoes the trauma of the story, and emerges cleansed after the experience. In kairotic play, the player experiences the same integrative processes as the character in dramatic moments. In kenosis, the player abandons his ego to transcendentally partake in the emotions and sensations of play.</blockquote>\nIn other words, a loss of a sense of self, replaced by complete absorption in the character, to the point where you experience what the character experiences. Again, this sounds like a type of flow.<br/><br/>So, while some people would like to define it more narrowly, and others would like to define it more widely, all of these definitions have a flow experience in common, or attempt to break down or analyze a flow experience. I've read hundreds of pages of peoples' accounts of immersion, and I have yet to read anyone define immersion in a way that really challenges the identification of "immersion" as the experience of flow in a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>That doesn't invalidate Matthjis' conclusion, though:\n<blockquote><cite>Matthjis</cite>I propose that there is no set of techniques that must be present for immersion to occur; nor is there any set of techniques that is guaranteed to break immersion.</blockquote>\nThe experience of flow has commonalities in any endeavor, but the techniques to enhance flow do not always look the same. For instance, "clear goals" helps create flow, but the nature of those goals differ if you play classical piano, pickup basketball, want to immerse yourself in a character, want to immerse yourself in an emotional ambience, or want to immerse yourself in a story.<br/><br/>Yet, while recognizing immersion as flow allows us to recognize the validity of many different experiences of flow, in many different contexts, it also allows us to talk more intelligently about how to cultivate more of it. Will believable, detailed characters help increase immersion? Received wisdom says yes, but Matthjis points out known examples where it didn't. Depending on the game, believable, detailed characters may constitute a crucial part of presenting clear goals. In those games, they may well prove crucial to creating flow--or, I would say, immersion. In a different game, detailed characters may not contribute to "clear goals" at all. In that game, believable, detailed characters may not contribute to immersion whatsoever. If we focus on specifics like that, then we can easily get sucked into this common idea that "immersion" has no meaning whatsoever, everyone means something different by it, and you can't really do anything to create more of it or not. I can understand that frustration, but it seems more the result of, frankly, nit-picking. If immersion just means a type of flow, then, for instance, we can talk about how to set "clear goals," with the understanding that how you do that in one game will differ from how you do that in another game.<br/><br/>I do think Matthjis makes a good point in his conclusion, though; since no matter what it means, immersion obviously describes a wide spectrum of experiences, you should try to state explicitly what kind of immersion you mean when you pitch a game to people.<br/><br/>I guess I look at this more from a designer's perspective. I want to understand the phenomenon of "immersion" principally so I can design games that deliver a more immersive experience. Understanding immersion as flow gives me that, and to date, it has held up to every description of an immersive experience I've ever heard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244070/#Comment_244070" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-28T15:29:34+00:00" title="November 28, 2009  3:29PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lee, let's assume for a moment, for the sake of argument, that I've gotten it right: immersion describes one kind of flow experience. Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi provided some criteria that he considered important for a flow experience, among them, a sense of personal control.<br/><br/>Given the "traditional" RPG's available from the 1970s into the 1990s, what did a player have control over, except a character? Doesn't it make sense, then, that before the 1990s, players might only experience flow in the portrayal of their character? Does that speak to the existence of a real phenomenon, or simply a lack of previous options?<br/><br/>Before "immersion" became an RPG term, it existed as a common English term, meaning, "to engage wholly or deeply; absorb." Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi began by studying the phenomenon of people absorbed in an activity, and he didn't put much restriction on the activity\u2014he included work and play, high-brow arts and common entertainment. He didn't explicitly address roleplaying, regrettably, but he addressed a sufficiently wide range of other activities that I don't really see the problem in applying it here.<br/><br/>I don't think you can accuse the people who mean slightly different experiences by "immersion" of "stealing" the word, when they appear to mean precisely what the normal, English usage means by it. Furthermore, I think the preponderance of definitions focusing on portraying a character tells us more about what players had control over in earlier games, than anything useful about the phenomenon itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244097/#Comment_244097" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-28T21:27:28+00:00" title="November 28, 2009  9:27PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>Given the "traditional" RPG's available from the 1970s into the 1990s, what did a player have control over, except a character?

The whole reason we are having this discussion about Immersion is because of the claims that the original theorists and their descendants made.  Both of these recent story-games threads are reactions to that discussion.  Of course there are people who understand that context, and people who don't (often the case in discussion of this topic).  Those people are largely talking past each other (also often the case in discussion of this topic).  And I strongly think that before you come to conclusions about the phenomena those immersionists are describing, that you really ought to observe some of their play and talk to them.  I doubt that you have done that, given that they have long been driven out of the discussion at places that discuss indie games (that event predates the existence of Story Games, BTW).  Maybe I'm wrong and you have talked to them; I'm willing to be corrected.  <br/><br/>Given that this whole discussion is in response to the claims made about immersion by those theorists, then, yes, I do feel that different usage of 'Immersion' <i>in that context</i> is indeed stealing the word (perhaps inadvertently -- reference "talking past each other"). Imagine some guy walking into a GNS discussion and using 'Narrativism' in the normal English usage and expecting not to be corrected.   So if you want to talk about Flow in RPGs, fine.  But please reserve the use of Immersion for the pre-existing usage until and unless you've got some established linkage.  I have no reason to doubt that such linkage might exist; I don't know enough about Flow to say.  <br/><br/>----<br/><br/>As for Flow and earlier RPGs, I think there are a number of different aspects which might have given rise to Flow.  Working the mechanics of combat.  Verbal descriptions and dialog.  Mapping.  Viewing the character in any number of ways, not simply through the lens of the game's fictional world.  In short, any number of things that do not correspond with the experiential immersion in the game's fictional world (which does not necessarily have to be done through the lens of a character).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244107/#Comment_244107" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T00:08:06+00:00" title="November 29, 2009 12:08AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lee,<br/><br/>huh?

As a little experiment, "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+narrativist" rel="nofollow">define:narrativist</a> on Google gives me, first, "The GNS Theory, as originally developed by Ron Edwards, is a relatively amorphous body of work attempting to create a theory of how role-playing..." from Wikipedia. By comparison, "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+immersion" rel="nofollow">define:immersion</a>" gives me "submergence: sinking until covered completely with water" from WordNet. Nothing specifically about RPG's even appears on that page.<br/><br/>Few of your examples give a player much to have control over. Mechanics usually involve a good amount of luck, in the dice. Players get fairly limited "spotlight" time, so they have fairly limited opportunities for verbal descriptions and dialog. While you might have other ways to view your character, through the lens of the fictional world that the character lives in seems, by far, the most obvious. So, I would still contend that this emerged as the most common definition of "immersion" simply because, until recently, it represented the only part of an RPG that a player really has much control over. Which means that the earlier definition of "immersion" that you champion focuses on something extremely narrow, because it emerged at a time when players only had an extremely narrow experience of flow in their games. As we've expanded the things that players can experience flow in, we've expanded the things that people can feel immersed in. As a result, people naturally (and, I would say, correctly) use the term "immersion" to describe their experience. I think it says a lot about the gaming community that we have made such a simple thing so much more complex than it needs or should be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244132/#Comment_244132" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T09:57:02+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  9:57AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Lee,<br/><br/>huh?

You attempt to shoehorn the whole discussion into a semi-academic debate, based on a specific definition (among several) that you claim to be the correct one.

I never subscribed to rec.games.frp.advocacy, but I had conversations about immersion in the late 1980s. The usenet group you happened to frequent has no greater a place in the history of discussing immersion than any other forum, including this one, or the Forge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244139/#Comment_244139" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T12:06:12+00:00" title="November 29, 2009 12:06PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason -- I guess I stand corrected.  But I don.t think I was making an unreasonable inference.  Google groups shows that rec.games.frp (pre-split) had exactly <b>one</b> reference to "immersion" or "immersive" or "immerse" that wasn.t a reference to immersing vampires in water or to language immersion training.  That article is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.frp/browse_thread/thread/bf4ee59bbfff3db4/4c8340e52743358e?q=immersion+OR+immersive+OR+immerse+group:rec.games.frp#4c8340e52743358e" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Expanding the search to include rgf.misc before 1994 yields no further hits.  So I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that usage of the term has exploded since then, given the very large number of hits post-1994.  But online discussion isn't everything, and I concede that your prior use is reasonable.  <br/><br/>Mattijs -- I guess it's a matter of how much we value precisely defined jargon.  Because the aforementioned theorists have done significant work with their usage of Immersion as jargon -- and I have seen any number of attempts to bring the whole body of work down by playing definitional games around the work 'Immersion.'  And <i>I</i> dislike that discussion technique strongly.  I'm not saying that that is what you were doing in your thread -- in fact, I think it isn't.  But I've seen it done so often that I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder about it.  Sorry about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
