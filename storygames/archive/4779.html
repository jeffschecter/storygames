I'm a full time lawyer, so it's definitely not my primary business. Moreover, I operate with the goal of breaking even on any product (thought that's hard to do in its own right, if it's your goal). I have no (immediate) designs on publishing products for the primary purpose of making money. I do not publish for the purpose of seeing my name on a product (though I admit that's a nice feeling on some level--silly, though--all it takes is Adobe Acrobat and a dream). I am trying to build a brand though. Mostly I publish because I enjoy the design process and the, when I've finished something, I understand I can bring joy and entertainment to others by publishing it rather than letting it sit on my hard drive.<br/><br/>So, am I hobby or business?

I mainly asked this because I've met several game designers who really seem to be doing it for the thrill of doing it (and that's what I meant when I said "see your name on a product." It is rather cool to have something in hand and be able to say "I created this"), but there are others that really seem to be working toward a goal of this becoming their main source of income or of building it into a larger business.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I meet podcasters I always ask them "If you could do this full-time, would you?" and a good portion of them immediately say "no."

I just had to do it part time from about 1996 to 2004 because it took us that long to generate a stable and large enough income stream to make that possible for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes for different considerations when you have to generate full time income levels from your designs, but its not like you have to sell out on your designs to make it possible. A large and steady back catalog with a means to sell them and healthy profit margins makes it doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus you get to consider all the various synergies you might never have considered if you stuck purely to design for design's sake. For instance, leveraging board game designs for use both board game production and computer game production. Leveraging an game world IP for publication in print, PDF, online subscriptions, for free online content that is ad driven, and for use in fiction. Being able to cross certain boundaries with your ideas can really give them the potential to fly further than otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, myabe, back when I first started publishing, I would have nver thought that some of things we do when running the business would also have turned out fun. Things besides just game design. For instance, I tend to like the creative process of applying our print and bindery machines to make our own goods. I like marketing. And I enjoy strategic business management. When I started the Guild I only knew I loved game design and knew not a lick about those other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext on our plate is to continue evolving our company to give us more opportunities to spread our game ideas further. Selling games into dollar stores, continuing to develop our online game adaptations and the business around those, devoping a multi platform RPG, and this winter it looks like we'll be opening our second retail store. The first one we ran back in 1999-2000 as a sort of test store experiment but did not continue with it. The new one will be a hybred store between print/copy/binding services and a game store. Its what makes sense for us at this time, to move the company out of our collective basements and garages. But it is also another test store format to see if this model would be viable to duplicate in other markets. I think it seems very viable because it generates revenues from four strems instead of just games and it lets us focus on brand building (ours and select other small publishers) rather than just stocking whatever the hot collectible of the day is (in fact, we intend to stock and sell very little top tier merchandise). With the continued growth of PDFs as a game format and means of distribution, there is an obvious an growing synergy there as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoves like this take a lot of pre planning and thought, but boy, they are exciting to implement as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

I personally believe "industry experience" has very little to do with the ability to design a god game. It may have a great deal to do weather its packaged all pretty like and if the person can turn a good dime or two selling it, get it out there and known to enough people to matter, etc, but some of the absolute best games have been designed by people never published before. In some cases that can even be best because they aren't tied to existing industry "standards" with regards to what is and is not commonly accepted design ideas. No one has beat them down yet on new ideas telling them they aren't &lt;/p&gt;</blockquote>\nYou missed the point. I wasn't talking about industry experience when I met Ryan and said what he is paraphrasing. I was talking about expected income from profit against time spent. It doesn't matter if you've been designing for a long time or not. A game designed with no particular expectation of compensation (or an expectation that is excessively low) depresses the standard of practice for the sake of slaking an ego and burdens  retail and distribution with indexing or choosing between too many products. For instance, a few back of the matchbook calculations tell me that when you divide the electronic marketshare by the number of publishers you get, well, shit -- and that's before ceding at least half of it to leaders like WotC/WW/etc.<br/><br/>This affects the value people place on creative work, promoting relationships and payment levels I consider to be exploitation. People want to keep costs down to such a degree that the community expects creative workers to screw themselves over. I don't think it's any coincididence that indie publishing dogma celebrates the person ponying up the dough as the creator, no matter the work s/he actually does. It's a convenient ideology when you want to pay artists, editors and even writers/designers crap because you can claim you're the *true* creator, and all of those other guys are mere instruments.<br/><br/>I think it's also has a bad effect on the community, as the rush to publish for compensation has helped poleaxe the previously thriving free games community. This isn't the only factor though; the shift from the static web also had an effect. For instance, much of what I've released for money myself is actually available for free in alpha versions, but it's hard to find, since it's attached to blog entries. Nevertheless, free original RPGs have kind of withered. When you go to indices you find a lot of dead links and stuff that hasn't been updated in a long time. People who republish free versions of their stuff are helping to a certain extent, but I've found in many cases they attach licenses that effectively discourage informal participation or they put them up in a non-portable format, like multiple wiki pages. Again, part of this is that the nature of the web has changed, but part of it comes from the fallacy of looking at *everything* as a potential commercial endeavour.<br/><br/>I prefer to do work that's socially responsible when it comes to the labour and consumer sides of things. It means that I produce things that I expect will make enough money to justify my working day and help support my family. It means that I pay partners so that *they* will have the same expectations and they're not just doing it for ephemeral, bullshit reasons like increasing their reputation in some subculture. Finally, it means that when I don't have those expectations it turns into a blog post or a PDF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107658/#Comment_107658" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T07:45:30+00:00" title="November 10, 2007  7:45AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>That must be why nobody's books ever have more than one line item.

From talking to various people about how they pay for editing, design, and illustration, there's not a lot of paying people poorly that I've heard about, though, if it does happen, folks may not want to admit it.  I do wish all RPGs would be better about giving all creators (whether artists, writers, or etc.) cover credit, but that's not about paying people poorly.  Most of the people that I've talked to pay artists / layout / etc. up front, before the work is done or as the work is completed, though I have heard of a couple of commission cases (which I generally dislike).  Most people allow artists to keep full rights and creative control over their work and are effectively only licensing it for use in their games.  I've purchased hundreds of dollars of artwork for products that are still in development, but the money has always been good and delivered on schedule, no matter the status of the project.  If there are crappy business practices in the indie games community somewhere, and there are probably are some, considering the diversity of people involved, I hope people make efforts to rectify and improve them.  But my sense is that they are not especially common, though it's hard to know for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107676/#Comment_107676" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T09:42:20+00:00" title="November 10, 2007  9:42AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2007 9:43AM by Andy.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><br/>Do you have evidence that this is being done or are you just slandering an entire category of people?</blockquote>\nLet's not go there, please.<br/><br/>EDIT: X-posted with Jonathan: <br/><br/>Let's instead <b>go there</b>, but with Jonathan's non-confrontational post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107679/#Comment_107679" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T09:54:01+00:00" title="November 10, 2007  9:54AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><br/>Do you have evidence that this is being done or are you just slandering an entire category of people?</blockquote>\nLet's not go there, please.<br/><br/>EDIT: X-posted with Jonathan:<br/><br/>Let's instead<b>go there</b>, but with Jonathan's non-confrontational post.<br/>I'm sorry for being a shitcocky over it.

But they also keep the rights to their art, which is not what happens--to my understanding--much of the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107683/#Comment_107683" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T10:12:31+00:00" title="November 10, 2007 10:12AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, Rob.

No.\n<blockquote>It has always been my experience that the drive to create games and the want to publish them is a healthy and natural aspect of the hobby. It keeps a core of the hobby extremely energetic about their hobby and that energy communicates itself outward to the rest of the hobby and makes the whole of the industry seem more alive and vibrant. That translates into a broader interest in the hobby by everyone else.</blockquote>\nI totally agree. I also don't see what that has to do with charging money. You seem to agree when you say:\n<blockquote>I think the difference between publishing it for free on your blog, for cheap as a PDF or for a premium cost designed to pull in professional level profit expectations is completely moot with regards to the above. I would even argue that an energetic new hobby publisher likely communites a positive energy with regards to their games more strongly than the old hat that has been publishing for 20 years and can't seem to get excited about it anymore.</blockquote>\nIncidentally, when I said "as a PDF" to contrast with for-profit I meant a *free* PDF. I've done a couple of those. If you're talking communicating enthusiasm, then it sure is easier to do so with cool free stuff. Download rates for it usually outstrip non-free counterparts by a factor of 10 or so, in my experience. So if you are indeed Doing It For the Hobby, free stuff rocks.<br/><br/>I can't speak for your assertion that Evil Old companies are A Drag, mostly because I can think of only one top teir company that I think is run by a fuckhead (Mongoose) and even it has decent, enthusiastic people working for it who do good stuff.\n<blockquote>If I have a pet project that I don't think justifies its existence in pure profit terms sometimes I shelve it to continue on with productions that better fit our longer term banrd building and profit goals or sometimes I'll let it see the light of day as a PDF. Not a free PDF, mind you. The game Dice Armies is a good example of that. It was an idea for a one off miniatures rules set where you use different die types as the miniatures units themselves. I wrote it out as a 7 page rules set and it sells for $1.99. Its sold maybe 150 units to date. Less the retailers' cuts, that's like $225 bucks. Not going to pay many bills or salaries with that one. A couple years from now maybe it will have doubled its revenues, which, of course, will still mean its made peanuts. Yet I still released it because I thought it was a neat little idea and that it ought to be shared. Strictly speaking, if I had wanted to make big bucks off this game I should have gone to China to have unique custom dice made in different colors and released this game with different colored boxed set with all the dice included along with the rules to make a starting army, then sold expansion packs for each color. That would have been the profit minded method for publishing that game. However, for a variety of reasons, it just made more sense for our company to toss it out on the market as a cheaply priced PDF instead. It would seem by your way of thinking I should have just given it away instead because in that format it wouldn't make enough money. And to that I would argue now who is devaluing who's time?<br/></blockquote>\nGoing by the profit you posted you've hit a target I consider reasonable based on the likely amount of time you spent in production, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107689/#Comment_107689" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T10:55:33+00:00" title="November 10, 2007 10:55AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>It's a convenient ideology when you want to pay artists, editors and even writers/designers crap because you can claim you're the *true* creator, and all of those other guys are mere instruments.</blockquote>\nI'm actually interested in what products you're referring to, in a less confrontational way than Robert. From talking to various people about how they pay for editing, design, and illustration, there's not a lot of paying people poorly that I've heard about, though, if it does happen, folks may not want to admit it. I do wish all RPGs would be better about giving all creators (whether artists, writers, or etc.) cover credit, but that's not about paying people poorly. Most of the people that I've talked to pay artists / layout / etc. up front, before the work is done or as the work is completed, though I have heard of a couple of commission cases (which I generally dislike). Most people allow artists to keep full rights and creative control over their work and are effectively only licensing it for use in their games. I've purchased hundreds of dollars of artwork for products that are still in development, but the money has always been good and delivered on schedule, no matter the status of the project. If there are crappy business practices in the indie games community somewhere, and there are probably are some, considering the diversity of people involved, I hope people make efforts to rectify and improve them. But my sense is that they are not especially common, though it's hard to know for sure.<br/><br/>It's not when it's paid, it's how much. <br/><br/>One of the things I am absolutely adamant about with MUM is that the endeavor either be worthwhile in terms of absolute dollars and cents and not merely from buddies feeling good helping buddies, or involve proportional risk and reward for all participants. With Leo Lingas, I negotiated a cheaper rate with him, but I thought better of it and paid him his standard. With Chris Huth, I reassessed his likely labour after the initial estimate and paid more than contracted, because it was the right thing to do. Oh, I felt a bit of a *sting* as it bit into my bottom line, but I like being able to say that when you buy Aeternal Legends, you're getting the fruits of labour that's been well-valued.<br/><br/>By contrast, I've encountered a couple of occasions where I was told that I could get everything taken care of gratis or for next to nothing, "because the indie scene is so happy to help people out." I don't think there's anything wrong with this enthusiasm and mutual aid. I merely think it's incompatible with an end result that pays the publisher above a reasonable threshold and the artist (or whatever) less.<br/><br/>If you want a specific example, look no further than Adept Press. The passive-aggressive suggestion of 20 bucks or less per illustration sucks. The "do as much as you feel like" rhetorical dodge, combined with Edwards' influence on the scene . . . not good.<br/><br/>This is not a problem with indie games alone. There are companies that make plenty of money on the backs of freelance writers that make a penny a word or less. With larger companies, there's also an unequal balance of power, but in many cases the creative workers make a decent amount of money. I don't like that imbalance, but it's the way business works. But I absolutely draw the line at the point where the worker can't even claim a decent amount of money from the experience.<br/><br/>With specific reference to the current of ideas in indie gaming, I think the emphasis on a single, auteur-like creator is specifically damaging. I see lost of people boasting about the money they've made, how going small and part time allowed them to realize their visions. I don't see anybody boasting about the money they've made for *other people*, how they're running things so solidly they can do well by artists and editors.<br/><br/>It's not easy. I know that some people promise the world and then *don't* pay, and that sucks, so it's better to promise what you can afford instead, but if you can't afford something that equates to paying a reasonable amount for someone's time, that still sucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107691/#Comment_107691" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T11:19:46+00:00" title="November 10, 2007 11:19AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Incidentally, when I said "as a PDF" to contrast with for-profit I meant a *free* PDF.

Both are giving away value and doing so for some self benefit. I figure it sure isn't my place to suggest the manner in which they chose to give away that value. The guy giving it away for free is getting no money back, but presumable getting a higher profile through the process of broader reach. The guy selling it at value of half its real worth is presumably getting half the worth back in money and getting the other half in profile building. Neither is wrong.

The acceptible "profit" is a totally subjective number that neither you or I can set for anyone else. Because to me, the "profit" for dice armies would not come close to be an acceptible or reasonable amount for the effort put in. That's why to me it was a product released purely because I thought it a neat idea worth sharing, not because it has generated a reasonable profit nor served any meaningfully strategic purpose towards furthering our business plans. I just did it because I wanted to. Now obviously I can't run a successful business doing all such things, but hey, there is no good reason I can't do a project like that when I want to either.</blockquote>\n At 500 words/page (being generous) it's about 3500 words of production.

Generally speaking, I contact artists that generally work outside the roleplaying and fantasy illustration market, ask them what a given project will cost, and pay them whatever they ask.  I have never negotiated prices with an artist.  I totally agree that people volunteering work for free is a nice gesture, but bad for business and properly valuing their contributions, so I really hope nobody takes anyone up on that.<br/><br/>Many small press d20 publishers operate in the way you describe, paying small amounts for writing and art and having most of the money channeled to whoever is organizing the projects.  I know of very few non-d20 small press publishers on Story Games or in the wider post-Forge community that operate that way.  Among <b>almost all</b> of IPR's clients, for example, books are the result of a single writer with no additional writing freelancers.  The Burning Wheel folks are a bit different in this regard, but I don't know enough about their operation to speculate.  I find it hard to imagine that Luke is anything less than a complete professional, however.  Often times, writers will also do their own editing and layout (see Matt Snyder, Luke Crane, Joshua Newman, etc.).  Sometimes, they will work with other indie game designers who are hired to provide editing (Rich Forest has done a bunch) or layout services (Matt, Joshua, and Luke have done a fair number of books, as has Jennifer Rodgers, a go-to illustrator and designer for at least a dozen indie games).  When supporting other indie designers, it's true that Matt may or may not choose to charge less than market price for his services (Matt?), but maybe he can speak more to that.  Jennifer is in the process, I think, of building a great career as a professional designer and illustrator, so I hope she's charging fair amounts for her magnificent work, since she deserves to do really well.  Artwork policies vary from book to book, but generally artists are paid adequately and up-front, I think.  Sometimes non-traditional illustration methods are used, of course, from public domain images (Steal Away Jordan) to strange artwork (Polaris) to using stock photography (cheap!) to having no art at all.<br/><br/>That's my experience of the "Forge influenced" (note, not just "Ron-influenced," though he's clearly a part of that) small press publishing model, which is why I find it hard to reconcile that with the picture that you're painting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107712/#Comment_107712" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T14:17:30+00:00" title="November 10, 2007  2:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Malcolm, I understand your stance on this issue, though I don't agree with it.<br/><br/>It would be very helpful if you could provide multiple examples outside of Ron, who's bound to be a controversial example from all sides.

What for art? For layout? For editing? For writing?</blockquote>\nI would say $100 a page for BW/greyscale is a minimum for art. Writing rate guidelines are nicely enumerated by the SFWA and HWA. Layout depends greatly on the type of job: size, colour, bleed, effects and formatting restrictions. Editing should be at least 1-2 cents per word. I also believe that it's reasonable to negotiate prices down somewhat for a substantial amount of work due to efficiency. My aim is to generate a basic minimum hourly income plus some consideration for uneven nature of the work. $20-$25/hour works nicely.<br/><br/>In lieu of this one can ask to share net income, taking on a proportional amount of risk and reward. There's risk, in that a project might bomb, but if it does well, the participants do well, too. I don't like unequally distributed shares for these arrangements.<br/><br/>Aeternal Legends uses a combination of the above.\n<blockquote>And, how much do you pay, by the way?

It really diminishes the value of your judgment on the matter, I think. <br/><br/>Seems like this topic matters to you. So far, you have again waded into a bear-pit of a thread where you mix up the usual important, intelligent nugget you have wrapped up in a bunch of horseshit contempt for the community you're in. Take the snark to Ryan above. That's just crap snark. You're a really smart guy, and  you have lots to offer here. How you can't see you're a raging asshole half the time, and how that interferes with your own self-stated goals is beyond me.
