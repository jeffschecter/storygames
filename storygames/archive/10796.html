The players are all <i>Suspects</i> involved in the heist that are taken into custody for questioning. The GM is the <i>Detective</i> assigned to the case. <br/><br/>At the beginning of the game the only things that are known are some of the details of crime scene where the body was found. The specific events leading up to that scene are told to the <i>Detective</i> by each of the <i>Suspects</i> in a series of questioning sessions. Each <i>Suspect</i> (in a random order) gets to recount each event and correct, elaborate, deny or build on what the previous <i>Suspects</i> have said. <br/><br/>The goal of each <i>Suspect</i> is to gain trust from the <i>Detective</i> and place blame on the other <i>Suspects</i>. In the end the <i>Detective</i> will arrest one of the <i>Suspects</i> and release the others, granting them immunity for their cooperation.<br/><br/><b>Here's How it Works</b><br/><br/>Initially I thought the resolution system would be very simple: <i>Suspects</i> would collect <i>Trust</i> tokens by admitting to their (minor) involvement in the heist. At the end of each questioning session each of the <i>Suspects</i> accuses another <i>Suspect</i> of being responsible for the death. The <i>Detective</i> will have a <i>Trust Threshold</i>, which is a random number that the <i>Suspects</i> don't know which they can't exceed when admitting involvement in the crime. If they exceed the <i>Trust Threshold</i> the <i>Detective</i> will not believe them when they make their accusation. At the end of each round (ie: after each <i>Suspect</i> has told their account of an event and made an accusation) the <i>Detective</i> will assign one point of <i>Guilt</i> to the <i>Suspect</i> who is accused by the <i>Suspect</i> who has collected the most <i>Belief</i> tokens, who hasn't exceeded the <i>Detective's</i> <i>Trust Threshold</i>. <br/><br/>After all the events leading up to the death are retold (probably five rounds) the <i>Suspect</i> with the most <i>Guilt</i> is arrested and the game ends.<br/><br/><b>Here's Where I Need Some Help</b> <br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is too simplistic. I'm foreseeing problems which I can't quite decide on solutions for. Here are some random thoughts:<br/><br/>- If each player accuses the same <i>Suspect</i> each round then it might become unbalanced. Do I need to make some rules to distribute the accusations (ie: you can't accuse the same <i>Suspect</i> more than twice in a row)?<br/><br/>- There will need to be at least 3 <i>Suspects</i> otherwise it's just two players pointing fingers at one another. But, if there are 3 wont that just encourage 2 players to gang up on the third? How do I avoid this?<br/><br/>- Should The <i>Suspects</i> make their accusation publicly to the <i>Detective</i> or should it be done in writing, secretly after their turn? Secretly after the entire round?<br/><br/>- Instead of trying to discourage <i>Suspects</i> from taking advantage of the rules should I just build that into the game where there are scenes in between questionings where the players can conspire against each other in private? Something like the game Diplomacy perhaps?<br/><br/>- Should I throw in some kind of randomizer (a card drawn or chart rolled) for each <i>Suspect</i> after each round that effects the <i>Detective's</i> view of their account? These could be something like: "The Scapegoat Card: If all other <i>Suspects</i> accuse you this round it will look like a set up. The Detective wont assign you <i>Guilt</i> but rather assign it to one of the accusing <i>Suspects</i> with the least <i>Trust</i>.  <br/><br/>- Should the <i>Guilt</i> assigned by the <i>Detective</i> be public knowledge or private? Seems like it should probably be private, but maybe keeping it public would help create some tension. <br/><br/>I'm really excited about this game, I think it has potential to be really fun, but I want to make sure I have all of the kinks worked out (or, at least as many as possible).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239470/#Comment_239470" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T11:25:51+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 11:25AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the "true killer" known to himself/herself at the beginning of play? That is, do you secretly draw a card which, if blank means you didn't do it but if it's got a big K on it means you did? In other words, does the game discover the killer, or invent one? I'm reminded of the party game Werewolf/Mafia, which does similar work but goes lighter on the mechanics. In general, I'd say the less arbitrary, you make the game-mechanical constraints, the more likely you are to generate the sort of play experience you want. Also, I'd think more systematically about the notion of "trust" here; it seems to me that it's not trust you're looking for, it's "suspicion." So the point of the game mechanics should be to provide a means for enacting the arousal and allaying of suspicion on the part of the detective <i>and the suspects</i>, so that part of what you're representing is the loyalties among the suspects themselves, in a <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> meets <i>The Usual Suspects</i> kind of way. I think it's not a matter of whether the detective believes a suspect's incrimination of another suspect; it's whether the accompanying confession (which must be made for credibility's sake) raises the minimum sentence the confessor must take out of the plea bargain. In other words, if you cop to a bigger crime, the detective is more likely to find you a credible witness--but the DA is less likely to let you get off scot-free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239515/#Comment_239515" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T14:44:32+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  2:44PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Is the "true killer" known to himself/herself at the beginning of play?

For the sake of this game, the killer will be whoever is the least convincing. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>In other words, if you cop to a bigger crime, the detective is more likely to find you a credible witness--but the DA is less likely to let you get off scot-free.</blockquote>\nThis is definitely more interesting than what I'm thinking, but I'm not exactly sure how to implement it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239573/#Comment_239573" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T04:55:27+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  4:55AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Imagine that you start by dealing three cards to each player from a deck that's got as many cards as players and always includes the Ace of Spades and the Queen of Hearts. The player who gets the Ace of Spades is the dead guy and becomes the detective. The player with the Queen of Hearts *really* did it; but now he's got something to hide. Detective player leaves the room while everyone else "gets their stories straight." The thing is, only the true killer knows who he is; all anyone else knows is that they are not the killer. And it's possible that the Detective player got the Queen of Hearts, too, so that everyone is innocent of murder. (Also, maybe you pass one card to another player, so that there's the possibility that you'll give the Queen of Hearts to someone else and know that they're the killer).<br/><br/>After a set time, you have Capture and Arrest. The Detective calls out each Suspect one at a time and interrogates them. They tell their stories. At any time, they can reveal one of their cards, which has an "incrimination value" -- it's the number of years you get for the crime you admit to in telling a story that implicates someone else in the murder.<br/><br/>Now comes the Courtroom phase. Everyone is back together. The Detective accuses one Suspect; of the remaining players, the one who has the highest incrimination value is the "star witness." The murderer reveals his card; if it's the Accused, the Detective and the Star Witness win; everyone else gets jail time. If it's someone else, the Star Witness gets *extra* jail time and the Detective loses, and the Accused wins. Everyone else gets jail time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
