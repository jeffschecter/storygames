He mentioned that Geiger Counter, Archipelago II and Universalis are all potentially similar games that he might want to play instead.</p>\n<p>This post is an answer to his first challenge: I compare <a href="http://www.benn.ca/muse/" rel="nofollow">Muse</a> with <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/geiger/" rel="nofollow">Geiger Counter</a>. First I'll show some of the major similarities and differences, and then give a summary at the end. Feel free to skip to the summary if you don't care for the details.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this comparison is <em>not</em> to bash Geiger Counter. It seems like a really neat game. I'm just trying to convince you that if you like Geiger Counter, then you might like Muse even more.</p>\n<p><strong>Side-by-Side Comparison: Muse vs. Geiger Counter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both games cost $0.</li>\n<li>Muse is playable with any genre or type of fiction, Geiger Counter is for survival horror only.</li>\n<li>Muse is a pure Storytelling Game (STG) where players do not directly play the roles of characters. Geiger Counter is an RPG where players rotate between being GM or playing a role.</li>\n<li>Muse plays best with 3-6 players, Geiger Counter with 5-7.</li>\n<li>Muse requires no unusual materials to play (1 deck of cards, tokens), Geiger Counter requires 20-30 d6 of which 8 need to be a different colour (tough for non-gamers to acquire).</li>\n<li>Both games require no pre-preparation.</li>\n<li>Both games run about 2-4 hours, work well for one-shots and have potential for follow-up sessions.</li>\n<li>Both games move clockwise around the table with players taking on the role of Narrator/Director.</li>\n<li>In Muse the Narrator tells the story unilaterally (within well-defined limits), whereas in Geiger Counter the Director is a GM and his role is cooperative with the other players.</li>\n<li>In Muse rules-arbitrated conflicts occur only between players. In Geiger Counter rules-arbitrated conflicts are character vs. character or character vs. menace.</li>\n<li>Muse is very structured, from the setup phase through to the ending. Geiger Counter's trailer and prelude phases are very freeform, it seems to me like a crapshoot as to whether or not they'll consistently produce good results. Furthermore, achieving the right ending seems freeform and tricky as well.</li>\n<li>In Muse, the game ends with the main protagonist either achieving or not achieving their goal. In Geiger Counter, the game's goal is to end up with the menace defeated and 1-2 characters still alive.</li>\n<li>Muse has winners at the end of the game, Geiger Counter does not have winners or losers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Summary: Muse vs. Geiger Counter</strong></p>\n<p>In summary, if you want to play the very specific genre of survival horror in which 1-2 characters survive, and you have 5 players available, then Geiger Counter is probably the better choice. I would try it! Geiger Counter is probably also the better choice if you feel that you absolutely <em>must</em> play a character role during the game.</p>\n<p>In all other cases I think Muse is the better choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's easier to start a game because you need easily-obtained materials and only 3 people to play.</li>\n<li>Muse allows you to play <em>any</em> kind of fiction, giving you total genre/style flexibility with only one set of rules.</li>\n<li>You can have happy endings, sad endings, even total tragedies where every character dies, and still have a really fun time playing.</li>\n<li>Muse's highly structured yet easy-to-learn rules support the players and help ensure that every game session is fun.</li>\n<li>Muse has a touch of something still relatively rare in story games: pure storytelling with no direct role-playing--and it creates living stories that don't seem like plot synopses.</li>\n<li>Muse is also a great choice for introducing non-gamer friends to gaming, because non-gamers are often more comfortable with narration (story-telling) than they are with acting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope I've convinced you to read <a href="http://www.benn.ca/muse/" rel="nofollow">Muse</a> and try it at least once. If yes, I'm very eager to hear about your experience. If not, then I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have, or listen to your comments and constructive criticism.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>--Jonathan</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344519/#Comment_344519" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T11:20:30+00:00" title="September 30, 2011 11:20AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What an interesting breakdown!<br/><br/>This part is well put, Jon:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Demiurge</cite>* Muse has a touch of something still relatively rare in story games: pure storytelling with no direct role-playing--and it creates living stories that don't seem like plot synopses. <br/>* Muse is also a great choice for introducing non-gamer friends to gaming, because non-gamers are often more comfortable with narration (story-telling) than they are with acting.</blockquote>\nI'm looking forward to seeing how this conversation develops (if it does), and hope that no one takes offense at anything said here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344546/#Comment_344546" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T13:45:12+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  1:45PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I for one am going to try it. 2-3 players GMless is actually my typical situation and not many games cater for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" title="Demiurge"><img alt="Demiurge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/684/n5EMN506IRUMS.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">Demiurge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344588/#Comment_344588" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T18:22:17+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  6:22PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong>Posted By: ivan</strong></p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I for one am going to try it. 2-3 players GMless is actually my typical situation and not many games cater for it.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you, Ivan.

It can be tough, so I definitely sympathize. This is probably, like Jason says, not the best way, but, oh well, live and learn.  It's definitely about reciprocity in this community and the more you play and get excited about other people's games, the more people are excited to play and talk about your own games.  It can sometimes seem like you have to "put in your time as an apprentice," in a sense, because in the beginning nobody has any reason to pay attention to you or your games (since there are a billion other things to look at on the internet), but -- assuming you have fun, smart things to say, and I'm sure you do -- it does happen eventually.  If Muse is really super awesome, you'll gain fans in small but consistent numbers for a year or two and then, sooner or later, a bunch of folks will be playing it (see: Red Box Hack, Lady Blackbird, Geiger Counter, Archipeligo, TSOY, Fiasco, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344820/#Comment_344820" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T08:45:14+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  8:45AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I apologize if I incited a throw-down!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Here's a better approach: Find another game looking for playtesters and jump in to help out.

Before I left, I was a published RPG author and frequent contributor to the Fudge RPG (e.g. I wrote often for the Fudge Factor online magazine and wrote the Fudge Vehicles chapter in the 10th Anniversary Edition of Fudge). During my hiatus, I was never really dormant. I was working on Muse the whole time with Paul T., and playing the occasional game session here and there. I tried some of Paul's experimental games and also played some published indie games like Dogs in the Vineyard and Lady Blackbird. So from my perspective I don't really <em>feel</em> like I ever left the community. But obviously I did since I haven't written much for so many years.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>If Muse is really super awesome, you'll gain fans in small but consistent numbers for a year or two and then, sooner or later, a bunch of folks will be playing it</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Muse is really awesome, so I hope you're right! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Since it's a free game my goal is not to make money, just to create a bit of community and get some feedback and hopefully some cool new ideas that I had never thought of.
