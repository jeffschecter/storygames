I'm probably going to post several different insights as I work through it, so here's the first one.<br/><br/>In chapter 1, one of their main claims is that pre-Enlightenment ritual practitioners generally viewed the world as disorderly and chaotic.  Rituals, then, served as islands of imaginary order within the sea of chaos, temporary spaces in which people acted 'as if' the world were orderly and understandable.  For example, many traditional hunting rituals present the world as if animals willingly offer themselves to the hunters that kill them.  However, if you talked to those hunters, they knew very well that, if they met a bear in the forest, it would most likely try to kill them, and the hunters were prepared to fight for their lives as well as the bear's. The ritual, in effect, created a 'shared imaginary space' between the hunters that bolstered their resolve through a fiction that they all recognized was not true.  Likewise, we tell children to say "please" and "thank you" <i>whether or not they actually feel gratitude</i>, since the important part is that they <i>act</i> as if they do.<br/><br/>What, then, is the purpose of ritual?  The authors reach back to the Confucian tradition (which started before Confucius and continued long after him) which suggests that "one of the goals of ritual is to be able to train practitioners to be able to act <i>as if there were a ritual telling them what to do</i>" (emphasis added) in situations where this is no clear ritual that provides guidance or when two or more rituals are contradictory.  For example, if a child encounters a situation in which saying "please" or "thank you" is inappropriate or inadequate (they are interacting with a deaf person or someone who doesn't speak English, perhaps, or someone has just saved their life), parents hope that years of ritual training, even in cases where rituals were followed without underlying feelings, will prepare the child to know what an adequate response to the new situation would be.<br/><br/>They also quote from the Rabbinical tradition, in which the ideal religious leader is "a man who is fully constituted through the Torah such that his most basic impulses are structured in accord with rabbinic laws and ideals. He attains this state by allowing himself to be trained, molded, planted, conquered, or governed by the tradition."  You could probably even say that the 'What Would Jesus Do?' movement is a cruder attempt at this same kind of ideal.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things about this approach is that, while appearing to strictly limit behavior to a particular tradition, it "actually legitimizes ongoing cultural production <i>within</i> the tradition by extending the mantle of tradition to future generations of interpretation and exegetical prowess."  In simpler terms, it allows people to build on a tradition while claiming that the additions are logical extensions of what's been around for centuries.<br/><br/>Here's how I see this connecting to roleplaying:<br/><br/>I've been playing <i>Bliss Stage</i> recently with some folks here in Boston.  <i>Bliss Stage</i> has a set framework for missions (similar, in fact, to the way <i>Mouse Guard</i> missions work) where one player, the GM, in the role of the sole remaining adult in the world, lays out the objectives that must be completed by these kids who pilot imaginary dream robots.  So we do this a bunch.  But then I have the sole adult character busy doing other things or abandon the kids completely or die.  How can we run missions without this crucial character?  In practice, we can handle this easily because, by following the rules early on, we have trained ourselves in the elements that are necessary for a mission and can run them just fine without the adult (in the fiction, one could even say that the adult has trained these kids well).<br/><br/>You see this <i>all the time</i> in roleplaying, which is a disorderly and chaotic thing if there ever was one.  Players are constantly encountering situations for which there are not specific rules or ones in which two different sets of rules appear to be contradictory.  But!  If you have played with a specific system long enough, it's dead easy to improvise rules (or, in the case of some groups, do without the vast bulk of the rules entirely), since you've been "trained" by the system to react in a way that is appropriate for a given game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183980/#Comment_183980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T12:07:32+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 12:07PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, one could even argue that <i>this is the primary purpose of having rules in the first place</i>.  Ultimately, as a game designer, you may not really care whether a group of players is following your rules exactly or not (that might even be impossible).  What you ultimately care about is whether the players' behavior follows the spirit of your guidelines and therefore leads to interactions similar to the pleasing interactions you see at your own table, when you play the game with others.  Ideally, then, the rules are there to <i>train players' behavior to instinctively follow patterns that will lead to the kinds of interactions you desire</i>.  Following the rules then is, primarily, part of the training process, and <i>you can only tell if that training has been successful once players start deviating from the rules</i>.<br/><br/>Likewise, this suggests that hacking a game -- as opposed to just building extensions onto the game -- is a somewhat different process.  You are, in effect, changing the training regiment because you want the group to learn a different pattern of behavior that the one the game presents or, alternately, not have to change certain existing patterns of behavior or certain interactions that you especially enjoy.<br/><br/>Thoughts, responses, and personal experiences of being successfully or unsuccessfully trained by practicing a rule set are welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183981/#Comment_183981" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T12:10:52+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 12:10PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Indeed, one could even argue that<i>this is the primary purpose of having rules in the first place</i>. </blockquote>\nI've said a million times that "The purpose of a rule is to make you think before you break it."

At the end of the chapter, the authors point out two main dangers for ritual communities, either:<br/><br/>1. Closing the canon, preventing future generations from contributing creative solutions; and<br/>2. Letting everyone interpret freely, such that the community dissolves.<br/><br/>But:<br/><br/>A. In the former case, people generally begin asserting creative solutions despite the closed canon, based on the sincerity of their contributions; and<br/>B. In the latter case, multiple independent traditions generally form.<br/><br/>The real danger is in instance "A," they say, because sincerity ("but I totally believe that this new Burning Wheel rule works!") is a bad substitute for actually doing something over and over again, among bunches of different people, until it is generally recognized as being beneficial and spreads to become a new norm.  This leads them to be critical of the post-Enlightenment emphasis on belief and sincerity over practice and tradition.<br/><br/>Feel free to draw your own conclusions in regards to roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183988/#Comment_183988" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T12:39:13+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 12:39PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>Does the work say anything about the different places and responses within a given ritual community?

Hence why it's so hard to "port" that kind of play to a new group or new people - the social dynamics change, the long built up history and informal knowledge of cues and rules are gone.<br/><br/>The value of formal rules from text at that point is how well they work in helping the group re-establish a common understanding of play if they find themselves drifting in different directions over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184159/#Comment_184159" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T14:48:17+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  2:48PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bliss Stage is a good game for this, I think.<br/><br/>Looking at Vincent's diagrams in the above link, a game with this property has a smudged line between "rules in the book" and "how we actually play."<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184232/#Comment_184232" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T05:50:01+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  5:50AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, the way PTA draws on TV tropes is somewhat related, in that TV narratives follow patterns that we instinctively recognize from a lifetime of watching television, so they are easier to draw upon in constructing rituals because, in effect, PTA points out rituals that you already know instead of having to teach you an entirely unfamiliar set of rituals.  But playing PTA is fundamentally different from the ritual of watching television, so I still think you have to play a fair bit of PTA for its rituals to "sink in," even if the rituals themselves are more accessible.<br/><br/>You asked for another example, so, um, say you're playing D&amp;D or Exalted or something, and you have a character that slides down a sharply inclined rock face.  You have rules for falling damage, perhaps, but those usually imply a straight drop, as if you fell off a cliff or something.  If you've been playing D&amp;D and Exalted for a while, you can come up with a reasonable, principled adjustment to the rules, like maybe you get a bonus to your save, which makes it easier to absorb the damage, or maybe you take half the damage that a straight fall would be.  And, most likely, the other players wouldn't argue with that because they've been playing the game too and share many of the same principles in regard to what "reasonable extrapolation" from the written rules looks like.<br/><br/>Also, any game that requires a GM (or another player) to assign difficulties (which includes, um, most mainstream games) also requires the GM to, over time, develop a sense of what a reasonable level of difficulty is for any given task.  How does this happen?  Well, initially, the GM assigns values based on the examples given in the book, but, over time, the GM stops referencing the "difficulty chart" or whatever and feels more confident just making a decision based on what seems reasonable.<br/><br/>Jee Hyung (is "Lee" your surname?), I certainly think adhering to those kinds of design principles would make it easier for players to get a handle on the underlying structures in a shorter period of time.  I mean, ritual theory suggests that, given enough play, players will determine the underlying lessons the rules are trying to teach whether the rules do a good job of making those clear or not.  This seems to be happening, I think, with 4E right now, as players determine that some of the underlying structures are not things they necessarily agree with or enjoy, but that only seems to have emerged from lots of play.  But making those clearer from the get-go makes it both 1) easier for designers and players to spot potential difficulties without playing the game extensively and 2) easier for players to feel like they can deviate from the rules earlier on, because they have a better sense of where and how to do that.<br/><br/>Chris, that's a great link.  One way of thinking about this (slightly different than the way Ben is suggesting) is considering ritual as <i>how the principles behind principled decisions are arrived at</i>, namely, in the same way that classical Confucian texts encourage gentlemen to cultivate virtue by adhering to ritual propriety (even when they're not feeling particularly virtuous), adhering to a rule set over time, even in situations where you might feel inclined not to (such as when bad things happen to characters that you care about), allows players to cultivate an imperfectly shared set of principles by which decisions independent of the procedures in the rules text can be made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
