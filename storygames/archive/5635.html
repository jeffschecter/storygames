It was the first year we used a Vanilla-style forum. It was the first year we required peer feedback and reviews. It was the first year where we split people up into smaller focus groups (rather than a free-for-all). It was the first year for 2 weeks instead of 1 to write.<br/><br/>This year, the only thing that I have set up as a "firm likelihood" is this:<br/>* It /seemed/ that the feedback groups worked, so I want to look into continuing that this year.<br/><br/>Things that are definitely going to implement this year:<br/>* A total step away from focusing on "winning" the event (going back to the roots of the event where the winner is chosen half-on-whim), and instead focusing strongly on peer feedback.<br/><br/>Things that I'm totally undecided on:<br/>* One week for design vs two weeks. Leaning again to two weeks, assuming that out of that time people will find a good run of about 2-4 days to write their game.<br/><br/>I've got thoughts for how I might conduct things this year. But I'd like to hear some casual feedback from folks who have participated in the past. Things like:<br/><br/>1) What did you think of the feedback groups?<br/><br/>2) What did you think about the forum structure? How about the 2 weeks?<br/><br/>3) What did you think about being required to review peer games?<br/><br/>4) Any suggestions for future contests?<br/><br/>Also, a question:<br/><br/>It seems like every year only about 30-40% of the people who "sign up" or weigh in end up completing the assignment. I'm assuming this is a natural thing for these kinds of contests. Anyone have any thoughts about that fact?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Again, this is informal, so while I might weigh in with opinions and stuff, a lot of the contest is still up in the air.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126021/#Comment_126021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T13:03:16+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  1:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>1) What did you think of the feedback groups?</b><br/><br/>They were excellent.  You need to keep them.<br/><br/><b>2a) What did you think about the forum structure?</b><br/><br/>Vanilla is fine.  It got better when we could turn off posts from other groups to help keep things organized.  The only problem: we could turn off other groups.  I got to know a few games very, very well and didn't get to know most of the games at all.<br/><br/><b>2b) How about the 2 weeks?</b><br/><br/>Two weeks meant a lot more people joined and a lot more games got finished.  That's both good and bad.  You have to decide if that's what you want.<br/><br/><b>3) What did you think about being required to review peer games?</b><br/>I think it's a fine requirement.  You should keep it. There's something good about giving back to something that's helped you out.<br/><br/><b>4) Any suggestions for future contests?</b><br/><br/>Pick ingredients that have almost nothing in common.  If you choose a theme, choose one that is managable. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>5) It seems like every year only about 30-40% of the people who "sign up" or weigh in end up completing the assignment.

On the other hand, one lends an air of urgency and leads to IRON, so I guess that would be okay.<br/><br/>Drop-outs are to be expected with something like this, I think. I seem to remember that some people didn't make a final submission even when they had a somewhat completed game... maybe a little more encouragement to submit at the end, even if you aren't happy with it? I think maybe some people might have felt that being unfinished meant submitting was a waste of time, but that shouldn't be the case.<br/><br/>Focus on feedback instead of winning is good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126035/#Comment_126035" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T13:25:08+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  1:25PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two weeks for the win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126085/#Comment_126085" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T17:38:50+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  5:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked being put in a "group".

The reason I still didn't finish was that I realized I liked my concept too much, and wasn't ready to prune it down to a 3-4 day game. Having 14 days to find 3-4 for making a game (2 weekends, really) was good.<br/><br/>- Groups were good. I'm echoing Caesar_X here. I think this also helps prevent cliquey feedback. I think most of the groups wound up with a good mix of very active and less active posters, and it's good to spread the very active people around.<br/><br/>- Assuming I finish this year, I'm a bit worried about peer review simply for the time requirements, but nevertheless, I think it's a good thing. Assuming I meet my goal this year, I'll just have to make that a part of the process, dammit.<br/><br/>- At the risk of painting myself into a corner, from an intrigued gamer perspective I'd love to see the creative gamma rays of Game Chef turned on the question of designing RPGs that are designed to be played over the net (Skype, BBS, etc.). Occasionally something gets designed around this idea, and D&amp;D is trying to do something with this, too for 4th edition. That said, I have no idea what I'd do with that requirement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126093/#Comment_126093" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T18:43:46+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  6:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2008 6:44PM by Bryan.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) What did you think of the feedback groups?<br/><br/>It didn't really work for me.

I see the reasons why to do it, but I don't think it's something you can really force for a two-week contest -- especially as folks blog or podcast about their progress.  That, and from the point of view of the new designer, folks like to be remembered.  I can see where it's a problem for others (and maybe me this year) but, eh, the new folks benefit from people remembering who they are after the contest.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think you should do something that ruthlessly culls entrants.  Some obscene condition or requirement that throws people into a black pit of despair, like "cannot include a way to resolve conflicts".</blockquote>\nThere's a sense of the same elitism that I had to deal with last year, as folks talked about how great previous years were and how the (then) current contest was lame.  If that's what people want, might as well make the condition "people who have finished Game Chef before."  As for me, I'm a man who likes the open format that accepts everyone, and would be willing to help somehow if that would help keep that alive.<br/><br/>I love creative constraints, so something like "cannot include a way to resolve conflicts" might be neat from that perspective.  But for culling entrants -- let them cull themselves by not finishing in the contest?<br/><br/>Maybe along with each group of words (if there's a two-group thing -- I thought that was awesome), maybe they also have a single constraint you also have to follow, like "must have rules involving colors" or "cannot have rules involving death," something like that?

How about the 2 weeks?</b><br/>I think the forum was really good.<br/>The 2 weeks time period was too much for me last year. I started really slowly because I thought I have time (less pressure) and then dropped out on the first weekend because "oh, these people have another week to polish their already solid game ideas and I have like... nothing." Looks like really bullshit thinking in retrospect but happened nonetheless and I don't think to me alone.<br/><br/><b>3) What did you think about being required to review peer games?</b><br/>I think it's worth everyone's effort. You get some people to look at your game after it's finished even if it wasn't popular during the contest - that's worth gold.<br/><br/><b>4) Any suggestions for future contests?</b><br/>As mentioned above: No choices and more difficulty would be nice.

Outsource awards for specific criteria to specific judges.

Combine with the self-nominating procedure from last year, and you still have some competition without the grind of a big free-for-all and the need to review eight million games.

Best part of Game Chef, though I had a good group leader who fostered a sense of community.<br/>\n2.

In defending your game, did it help you understand your game better anyway?  I guess I am trying to figure out if you got feedback that was one line "This game sucks" or if something else is going on.  Just curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and while I liked the thematic openness (to have games as widely varied as a game on Grover Cleveland, city sized planets flying though space where secret agents drug each other, Know Thyself, and Land of a Thousand Kings is to me I believe a STRENGTH of game chef) I can see limiting things down.  However, limiting mechanics, I'm generally opposed to.

Enforcing forced anonymity for everyone, coming up with their names for them, is going to be an administrative chore that I don't have time for this year, honestly. It won't happen.<br/>However, I will HIGHLY ENCOURAGE folks to take on a pseudonym of their own choosing. Perhaps pointing them to random generators to choose their name.<br/><br/>Also, cute anecdote: A few years ago, right after MLWM came out and was on everyone's mind: I'm judging my assigned entries for Game Chef, when I come along this entry that's really reassuringly written, and refers to things like colored dice, endgames, etc.  I thought, "LOL, this poser is trying to <i>be</i> Paul Czege". With that in mind, I proceeded to give it lower scores. I really reamed it, of course for objective reasons, but it was all built on a subjective foundation of judging this guy harshly for trying to recreate the forumlaic writing of Paul Czege from My Life with Master.<br/><br/>Turns out, that it WAS Paul Czege who wrote that game. It was Bacchanal, actually. I loled, but had that nervous anime "sweat tear on back of head" thing, when I found out. Oops.<br/><br/><b>on the issue of one week vs two</b><br/>Still totally torn on the issue. Looking back on last year, it seems that even though there were 2 weeks/3 weekends, only maybe 10 people actually were working those whole two weeks. It seems that everyone else did their work over one single weekend or over 3-5 days at some point, and spent the rest of the time giving feedback to others. That's just staring at the forums with a lazy eye and recalling conversations from last year. So with that, 2 weeks/3 weekends gives the Gamers With Jobs enough time to participate when they can, given random busy work loads. Yet it's also unfair, as the students/unemployed/bored can work on it for those 2 weeks, straight.<br/><br/>In the end, I chose 2 weeks last year because I was hoping for people to have enough time to give each other feedback during the development process as well, rather than just at the end (the review process). With one week, people will presumably be too busy with their own project to give any development feedback.  However, that might be OK: As mentioned above, not all the development feedback was good (while the review feedback seemed far more useful), so it might be best to have people sort of develop on their own in a tight crunch environment, then afterwards take the time to review/look at other entries in their group.<br/><br/>Still weighing this. I could always say, "Two weeks, total. Additional Iron Chef Challenge: Do it within the first week, period. Then spend the second week giving development feedback to others. You will be judged to be an Iron Chef Master. RAWR!" <br/><br/><b>on the issue of doing stuff to make sure more people participate/finish</b><br/>Yeah, I'm getting the feeling drop-outs are inevitable. No skimping on the ingredients/challenge, and no coddling. It'll continue to be rigorous(ish).<br/><br/><b>on the issue of Bryan's item suggestions</b>:\n<blockquote>I'd like to see these items part of the contest:<br/><br/>* No prep.<br/>* Easy to learn the basics or it doesn't take twenty minutes trying to explain how to play. \u201cAppealing and quickly playable.\u201d \u201cFew minutes to learn, lifetime to master.\u201d Not \u201crules-lite\u201d or \u201cdumbed-down\u201d<br/>* Add a board or some physical representation of the imagined space. "What kind of game is it?" "Oh, it's a little like a board game?"<br/>* Lose the term "role-playing." It's a game.<br/>* Somehow reduce or remove a central power figure or no GM.<br/>* Include more items to spark creative imaginings or you don't have to make stuff up and play pretend.<br/>* Shorter playing time, and no expectation of multiple session play.</blockquote>\nThey all smell great, and we might see something like this creep up in the future. However, all of the above any single person could readily attempt to fulfill on their own; they don't need the Master Chef to tell them to be innovative. Also, I'm uncomfortable with setting a Creative Innovation Agenda, then setting 150 strangers loose to fulfill my bidding. Unless I was paying them, or something. But again, all that people can do themselves.<br/><br/>Also, not losing the term "RPG". Otherwise, we'll have an additional 500 people coming in from the boardgamegeek forums to develop card and board games for the event. We have to have lines.<br/><br/><b>on the issue of completion</b><br/>I'm hoping to do more to encourage people to "submit their game anyway", even if it's not finished. I certainly submitted unfinished works the past two years, and am hoping that others don't give up because they couldn't think of a few rules. Let's drum up more "Hey, give it a shot and submit it anyway" noise.<br/><br/><b>on the issue of peer review</b><br/>Sorry, forgot to mention: Peer reviewing will absolutely happen. BUT, the links between Peer Review, Points, and Teh Winnar will be totally broken. That is, there probably will not be point scoring for peer review (instead, there will be just the categories), and the final winner will be decided outside the review process, by the High Lord Grand Iron Chairman Kaga:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.popcultureshock.com/wp-content/uploads/manga/kaga_takeshi_e.jpg"/><br/><br/>EDIT: Quoting Graham:\n<blockquote>Long, long, arguments about rules. Will people vote tactically? Won't this give people an advantage? Why don't we do it this way? It was rather tiring. Yes, I took part.</blockquote>\nLuckily, this year there will be no peer voting tied to the winner. Which may create long, long arguments about <b>that</b> arrangement, but I'm OK with that. :-)<br/><br/><b>on the issue of no choices</b><br/>I'm in favor of hard choices, which is why I like the "2 lists of 4, choose 3" rather than the "list of 5, choose 3" (with the latter, we might see that in place again if there are rigorous other requirements). In a smaller competition between, say 10 people, I'd totally love to see 5 hard ingredients and what games developed out of that.  With 150-200 people, though... I want a little bit of wiggle room.<br/><br/>It reminds me of the Olympics: Some folks are from Poland and toss Javelins. Some folks are from Norway and do High Jump. Other folks are from Germany and do Badminton or Wrestling. But in the end, every night the bars are filled with Olympians from all countries who drink together, who pair off for wild nasty no-hitch booty. Iron Game Chef isn't so much The Pole Vault, but the Wild Olympian Drink And Fuck Shack. To engage in metaphors, that is.<br/><br/><b>on the issue of lameness</b><br/>There's a sense of the same elitism that I had to deal with last year, as folks talked about how great previous years were and how the (then) current contest was lame.<br/>This happens *every year*, going back as far as I can tell at least five years. I take the kernel of feedback buried in there to heart, but pretty much ignore the "this year is lame/the Golden Past was much better" part.<br/><br/>Hmmm, that's all as of this posting.

I have tried joining Game Chef in the years before feedback groups, and tried a few other game design competition things, but never had the motivation to actually finish anything except some 24hour games, unless I had some outside peer feedback keeping me going.  So Feedback groups are mandatory, in my mind.  This isn't to say that feedback groups need to function identically to 07's groups, but I can't think off the top of my head of a way to restructure things to provide better feedback.\n<blockquote>2) What did you think about the forum structure? How about the 2 weeks?</blockquote>\nI like the 2 weeks in theory, and liked the opportunity to playtest the game partway through and make sure things more or less worked.   But I also finished my game entirely in one week and spent the last week making really minor changes and uglifying my layout.  So I would have done just as well in a one week version. <br/><br/>Come to think of it, count that as a vote in favor of the "two week/one week optionally to be really macho" model Andy proposes.\n<blockquote>3) What did you think about being required to review peer games?</blockquote>\nI am 100% in favor of peer review.  It meant that people looked at and offered useful criticisms of my game who otherwise wouldn't, which is all good.  It also meant that I looked at some games I wouldn't have normally, which is also good.  It meant a few bad apples gave crappy feedback, but they were easy to identify and ignore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126371/#Comment_126371" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T00:39:03+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:39AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 12:58AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>1) What did you think of the feedback groups?</b><br/><br/>Excellent. Of course, my group was awesome, and I understand that wasn't always the case. I'm not sure what to do about that -- slightly larger groups? Opt-in groups? I think this was successful enough last year to try it again. Maybe make a point of explicitly encouraging people who aren't getting what they need from their group to post to a 'please check out my game, nobody else is' thread (I believe one was informally started last year, but it would be good to make that opportunity as clear as possible.)<br/><br/><b>2) What did you think about the forum structure? How about the 2 weeks?</b><br/><br/>I thought the forum was fine, the ability to mark favourites and also toggle different groups was pretty excellent. I felt like I had a lot of control over how deep I wanted to go -- I could scale my participation very easily depending on how much time I had to give.<br/><br/>As for time scale, I wouldn't have finished my game in one week. But I still think the contest should be one week. Especially given all the peer review, etc. etc. afterwards, last year's contest stretched a little long, and took up a little more of my life than I was anticipating.<br/><br/><b>3) What did you think about being required to review peer games?</b><br/><br/>Mixed feelings. I enjoyed the process, and put <i>a lot</i> of time into my reviews -- but that also kind of made me feel disappointed when I saw some of the other reviews, and the peer reviews I received weren't necessarily that valuable. In the balance I'd prefer if this sort of requirement was kept, because it helped force me to do something that a) I really did want to do for other people but b) could easily have let slide in other circumstances.<br/><br/><b>4) Any suggestions for future contests?</b><br/><br/>Since you've already said that the focus will shift away from winning, I imagine this problem will solve itself, but -- please, for god's sakes, make the whole thing shorter. Last year it just dragged on, and on, and on, and on... I mean it was like a month (or two?) from the contest ending to the finalists being picked? I understand that you wanted to give people lots of time to do their reviews, etc., but I felt like it really backfired -- all the extensions and two-weeks-where-one-week-is-fine periods totally destroyed the momentum of the contest, which was reflected by the remarkably low number of votes for the finalists. The contest itself was basically dead long before it was technically complete, and I think it really came down to your unwillingness to force people to actually buckle down and get their shit done in a reasonable amount of time. The whole thing should be over in a month, start to finish, including peer reviews and anything else. Not having that whole finalist run-off should make that a lot easier.<br/><br/>Also, I am in total agreement with the people who suggested a) no choices in ingredients and b) interesting requirements. If you must make the mechanical requirements opt-in, okay, but more than one list of ingredients was overkill in the softy department. Not to mention, not very Iron Chef-like. I also much prefer the idea of more choices from a single list than less choices from two separate lists.<br/><br/><b>It seems like every year only about 30-40% of the people who "sign up" or weigh in end up completing the assignment. I'm assuming this is a natural thing for these kinds of contests. Anyone have any thoughts about that fact?</b><br/><br/>I think it would be nice to put some thought into a way of better honouring/including those people who aren't able to finish a game. There's so much focus on 'get it done get it done get it done' during the contest itself -- for good reason, you really need that kind of mindset to finish anything in that short a period -- that when people end up not getting it done at the end, it can feel pretty crappy. It's not that anyone actually thinks failing to complete a game is a 'failure' of any importance, after all, that's just a fiction the participants collectively invent to motivate themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126375/#Comment_126375" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T00:52:42+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 12:52AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Enforcing forced anonymity for everyone, coming up with their names for them, is going to be an administrative chore that I don't have time for this year, honestly.

Both last year and the year before, I had planned to and then things made my participation... not a realistic thing. So, I'm posting as someone who's planning to participate this year (and won't vapor away like last time!)<br/><br/><br/>I like having a week to do something. A week is tangible, it can be planned out, it's a short enough time span that those around you can suffer through your craziness. Two weeks doesn't feel tangible. It isn't a thing, it's two things stapled together. There are repeat days - more than one Saturday! More than one Tuesday! It's half a month. It's an entire paycheck. Eek!<br/><br/>I totally vote for one week.<br/><br/>As for winners: I think the special awards given by past winners were always way cooler than overall winner. I think that there should be contest "winners", but they should be categorical (f'rex: Most Innovative Resolution Mechanics; Best One-Shot Game; Most Profane Entry, etc.) and picked arbitrarily by the people managing the particular award. I think it would make sense to have past winners and organizers volunteer to run awards. Ideally 3-6 different awards, based on whatever criteria the awarder thinks is cool that will fit with the ingredients. As the contest goes along, people make nominations for awards. At contest end, awarders read the nominations, and pick a winner based on arbitrary gut instinct. No scores, no required feedback process, just a declared winner.<br/><br/>I think that randomly assigned usernames would rock so hard. I understand that you don't want to take on more work. Is there a way that this process could be assisted?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126392/#Comment_126392" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T04:16:26+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  4:16AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 4:17AM by thor.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>1) What did you think of the feedback groups?</b><br/><br/>I thought they were wonderful. Haveing a group of people that I needed to look in on made the fact that there were 200 games less daunting. I still looked in on 8 or 10 games outside of my group mostly from people I knew or ideas that gelled early and caught my eye. <br/><br/><b>2) What did you think about the forum structure? </b><br/><br/>It was perfectly adequate. It is a format that we are all very used to.<br/><br/><b>a) How about the 2 weeks?</b><br/><br/>I have an approximately fourteen day attention span so two weeks worked for me. In spite of that I screwed up and changed my mind and started over blowing the added time away. Still I got to playtest and felt slightly more finished last year. but then I flagged in the post chef review period. <br/><br/><b>3) What did you think about being required to review peer games?</b><br/><br/>I think that the peer review was fine, but I am not for it. I don't know that I helped anyone very much. I felt at the time I was being particularly hard on the games I was reviewing which made me feel bad. Then I got my reviews and they were harsh too and I felt worse.<br/><br/>The horrible reviews I got in my first game chef while completely justified kicked the crap out of me. Even knowing they were right, crushed what love I had for that game. I made a pretence of wanting to fix it afterward but essentially threw it away in disgust.  <br/><br/>I think that the game chef and the peer review process should be detached.  Many of us need a lot of encouragement within in the confines of gamechef just to see it through.<br/><br/>If we could somehow have a seperate charrette afterwards where people who want to really put hammer and tongs to their games could go. I might volentarily put my game in if I thought it was done but I wouldn't waste peoples time if it was half baked crap I made it to the finish line with. <br/><br/>It seemed to me that durring the first couple of Game Chefs the games that people wanted to make better showed up on The Forge. There people did their level best to push them into shape. I think that a post game place where people can put their games up for help criticism would be better than mandatory participation.<br/><br/><b>4) Any suggestions for future contests? I think changing the nature of the contest from year to year will make for a better contest. Some people will work better under one set of criterion than another and if I don't shine this year I can be confident that next year i will still have the ability to shine at something else. <br/><br/>Also, a question:</b><br/><br/>It seems like every year only about 30-40% of the people who "sign up" or weigh in end up completing the assignment. I'm assuming this is a natural thing for these kinds of contests. Anyone have any thoughts about that fact?<br/><br/>See above. Like Nanowrimo, finishing at all makes you a winner. so focus less on finding the best game.   A detached beauty contest after the game would be great for those who get enjoyment from that kind of the competition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126396/#Comment_126396" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T04:42:02+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  4:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, random thought - you could structure the awards to help format the games.

Felt like the blind leading the blind at times. Lots of posturing especially from the mid name indie kids.<br/><br/><b>2) What did you think about the forum structure? How about the 2 weeks?</b><br/>Forum was great. I'd prefer one week.<br/><b><br/>3) What did you think about being required to review peer games?</b><br/>It was a pain in the arse but actually made me read the games. Though again it felt like the blind leading the blind - the reviews and feedback were not overly helpful.<br/><br/><b>4) Any suggestions for future contests?</b><br/>Actual goddamn play! Games are supposed to be played - out of the dozens of entries from last year how many AP threads have been spawned? Not enough. <br/>I'd like a requirement to playtest someone else's game in there - if you want a shot at winning.  <br/><br/>Please some sort of word limit. If you can't write a decent game in 10K words then you can't write a decent game. Maybe there could be an extension allowed for fluff.<br/><br/>If you're gonna have winners then I'd favour a panel of independent experts rather than competitors reviewing each other.<br/><br/>I'd like enforced anonymity - a big name like Fred winning is not interesting, but if Fred gets to throw off his mask after Donny Chapeaux wins that's cool. The big namers get a lot more interest than the noobs - and a lot more backlash. Emily's <b>Heart of the Rose</b> should have placed higher. <br/><br/>I played the contest in character last time which was lots of fun. Though choosing such a villainous alter-ego and the lack of Mighty Boosh fans (what's wrong with you people?) meant this didn't go down as well as I'd hoped (I was channelling The Hitcher btw). So I heartily recommend role-playing in a role-playing game design contest - ooh how meta is that!<br/><br/>The RPG term also seemed a bit problematic for some elements. Uhh RPG must have GM, must have Dex stat...etc. The arguments got so stupid and tedious that I lost interest in the competition. Shame, 'cos Andy gave good advice on being generous with what is an RPG - but it was ignored.<br/><br/>Howsa bout you call em story-games this time, since y'know this is Story-Games an all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite><br/>a. Some really unhelpful comments, both in threads and in reviews. Not on my game, but then my game was great. The one that sticks in my mind is "Where's the fun?", but there were more pointed ones, too. </blockquote>\nSee I still think games are supposed to be fun and if a reviewer can't see why a game would be fun then "Where's the fun?" is a valid question. If the designer can't answer then there's a problem with that game.

There is a ridiculous amount of posturing that happens, which is more obvious when you're not a part of it.  Joe really nailed that one.<br/><br/>I also felt like there was a lot of unproductive energy spent in threads that weren't directly related to game design or the contest, but I'm not sure if that can be harnessed for more productive ends.  There just seemed to be a lot of socializing, which is not too surprising when people don't already know each other from other forums (since people now come from all over for Game Chef).<br/><br/>Actual play is a good requirement.  Maybe it could even be part of the rules?  Like, you either have to play your game or have someone else play it in order to count as "finished."  Seems like feedback groups would be a great place to swap games and try out each others' stuff.

Jacobson</cite>I like the idea (of Actual Play) in theory, but in practice it falls apart like wet sugar.</blockquote>\nI'm kinda feeling the same way. It's a game design contest. Fun will have to be eyeballed. <br/>I remember Jason M wrote the arctic exploration game which he later found out, after the contest, that in play didn't work out. So if it's not playable, that will eventually be found.<br/>Basically, the only reason I want to see people aim for a PLAYABLE game is so that they don't write <br/><br/>Also, I hear the arguments for anonymity, and they are sound. I'm can't enforce it, but I'm going to ask that everyone joining, old hat or new, adopt a pseudonym*. What happens from there, we'll see. Even though a lot of us went anonymous last year it took me exactly 2 posts and 12 seconds to figure out who Shreyas was, frex.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JoE PrincE</cite>I played the contest in character last time which was lots of fun. Though choosing such a villainous alter-ego and the lack of Mighty Boosh fans (what's wrong with you people?) meant this didn't go down as well as I'd hoped (I was channelling The Hitcher btw).</blockquote>\nYeah, unfortunately our hobby is already filled with unstable clods without a good sense of what makes funny in normal conversations. If I saw these comments from YOU, I'd be like, "Ha, he's playing up that role for effect, or saying these things in that ironic sort of "in your face" way". Instead, we were left with thinking, "This dude is an unhelpful jerk". Or else, "Wait, maybe this dude is trying to be funny and edge in that Andy Kaufman kind of way. <b>But I fucking hate Andy Kaufman</b>." Anonymity creates... complications. If you're going to take on a role, be a princess, be an elite chef, be a special ops space marine, be a Taiwanese World of Warcraft Gold Farmer, be anything other than "a normal guy who is a jerk". Please.<br/><br/>Also, I'm always willing to give things a shot for a year to see how they fly, rather than justifying why X would be good or bad. To that end, I think I'm going to roll with a one week (plus a day or two: 8-9 days total, to be fair to people worldwide) for the design competition this year to see how that goes. The winners will be decided by an elite council of select judges (who effectively won't be able to win if they participate). The winners will be announced only after a feedback period where peers are to review each other (perhaps for 2 weeks).<br/><br/>Finally, the arguments for word/page count sound good. I'll pick one and stick with it this year to see what happens. Both are effective creative constraints on layout and format in their own right. I might make the upper limit high, but still impose some sort of limit, and encourage folks that, if they have more to say about the game, for the purpose of the contest they perhaps create a second "optional" document that contains more info on the game, but is not considered for the judging.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>Andy, I call upon you to put the Iron back into the Game Chef.

It almost doubled participation from the previous year.<br/>In the future, the contest will embrace the "damn, this is difficult!" aspect of the original gig. I mean that in a non-elitist way.<br/>This year... You'll see some creative constraints the likes of which you've never seen before.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* I might participate as "Jonathan Walton"**. :-)<br/>** Or "Jonathan A.C.

I think it worked out okay. I'd really like to have a "widows and orphans" channel, where if you're not getting enough feedback, you can post it there for general observers to comment on.<br/><br/>Anti-enforced anonymity, but pro pseudonyms in general (don't like how you're treated as a "name?" Don't like how you act? Want to make a statement? Be anonymous.) Part of the deal with this contest is it is a way to create social bonds. Enforcing anonymity is handicapping social newcomers in order to make old-timers feel more comfortable about their own internet fame. I'm strongly against anything that handicaps new people to the benefit of old hands. Frankly, I'd much rather alienate old hands.<br/><br/>Pro- peer feedback. If you can't take the time to read five other people's games and comment, seriously you need to fuck off.<br/><br/>Anti- peer judgement, but pro- having a winner. Peer judgement is full of bitter, bitter poison. But winning is fun. We just need to get back to the spirit of the original IGC, where winning isn't as big a prize as finishing. I think that arbitrary judgement will help this.<br/><br/>Anti- word count limit. Rather strongly. It takes a lot longer to write words than to read them. I'd be happy with "be aware that if your game is over 10,000 words it might be skimmed." I think that the book-length games last year were done partly because of the two week limit.<br/><br/>Anti- any sort of AP requirement: dittoing Justin. Providing an IRC channel does nothing in this regard: IRC play is so alien from face to face play as to not even be worth considering for playtesting. The only way I could see this working would be under a different contest, which would be like "Day 1: design a game in 24 hours. Day 2: Playtest game. Day 3: rewrite the game in 24 hours. Day 4 Playtest again. Day 5 revise again. Day 6 layout." Which would be fun, like a game triatholon, but it's a much more limited sort of thing.<br/><br/>(And I actually think that last year's contest generated a lot of play: I know that I've played a lot of 1000 kings, there's been some play of Heart of the Rose, Know Thyself, Penny for My Thoughts, etc.)<br/><br/>(Speaking of which, does anyone know what happened to Time's Knot Garden?

A quick point on the two-week time limit, sparked by something he said.<br/><br/>With last year's two-week limit, many games were distressingly <i>polished</i>. Two weeks is actually quite a reasonable time to design a prototype, put it aside, come back, change a few things, lay it out properly, find some art and so on. It resulted in games which, in my opinion, <i>looked</i> finished, with their polished text and layout, but <i>weren't</i>. <br/><br/>With one week, there's just no time. A one-week time limit, to me, says: "We all know you can't design a game in one week. It's cool. Do what you can". There's no pretense that the games are finished: it's a competition about alpha designs.<br/><br/>I'm not quite expressing this perfectly, but you see where I'm going. A one-week limit produces interesting alpha games. A two-week limit lets vanity and polish creep in.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126487/#Comment_126487" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T10:09:13+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 10:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>but you see where I'm going</blockquote>\nYes, I can.

Hi everyone!)<br/><br/><b>Feedback Groups</b><br/>I loved having a group.  I felt a strong desire to give feedback within my group, and it definitely kept me motivated through my midpoint slump.<br/><br/>Last year, latecomers (most of whom tended to be first-timers) got shunted into just a couple of groups.  I'd strongly suggest keeping groups numerous enough that latecomers can be added in a fairly distributed fashion.  I'd rather have groups that were a little bigger (or a little smaller, if there are fewer newcomers than anticipated) than see the late-arriving folks get shoehorned together.<br/><br/><b>Forum Structure</b><br/>I liked being able to control my view of which groups I was looking at, at any given time.  Each day of the contest, I'd turn on a different group and read/comment on as many games as I could.  The ability to narrow it by group made this seem feasible instead of overwhelming.  I also really liked the ability to bookmark threads where I was doing ongoing design feedback (most relevant outside my own group, of course).<br/><br/><b>Contest Length</b><br/>I'm strongly in favor of a ten-day-ish contest - two weekends and a week in between.  Two weeks is more for development than prototype, as other people have said, and changes the expectations for the product.  I also found that I tended to procrastinate more with the two-week time limit, though that may just be me.<br/><br/><b>Peer Review</b><br/>Awesome, but decouple it from judging.  You should have to do peer reviews to stay in the running, but that's it.  If the contest is ten days, maybe give ten days to write your reviews after that - so you're keeping things at a fair boil.<br/><br/>I wish there were a way to give feedback about people's ability to review.  I saw a lot of shitty, thoughtless, and clueless peer reviews.  Doing game feedback and critique is a skill, too, and it's one that I think it's important for would-be designers to master.  I don't know how to implement this other than social pressure, of course, but it's a dream!<br/><br/><b>Anonymity</b><br/>Please don't make people be anonymous!  I'm one of those people who was strongly benefited by non-anonymity in my first Game Chef - no one really knew who I was before then.  I can testify personally that the benefits of non-anonymity in Game Chef are real, tangible, and important.  <br/><br/>I feel strongly about this, to the point that I probably would not participate if I had to be anonymous.  I am myself when I design.  I don't really want to pretend to be anyone else.<br/><br/><b>Play-testing</b><br/>This is just not feasible.  It also doesn't really help us know who's a good designer because it depends on logistical, not design, ability.<br/><br/><b>Length Limits</b><br/>I don't care about this one way or the other.  I'll read games of any length, and I think the super-long games will be self-limiting in how much feedback they get during the GC process.<br/><br/><b>Ingredients</b><br/>Please give us mechanical restrictions!  I found them immensely useful as constraints!<br/><br/>Beyond that, I don't care about themes, or how many 'flavor' ingredients there are, or whatever.  It's clear that there will be some words to take inspiration from, and that's good enough for me.<br/><br/><b>Awards</b><br/>I don't mind the process of awards being given by individuals, but I would prefer to see the awards given by committee.  Having a single individual selecting the winner(s) only tells us about that person's preferences.  I think a small group would do better at recognizing games that are interesting, innovative and successful as opposed to just personally pleasing.  Plus Amabile found that groups can actually come to pretty good agreement on what's creative, so I don't think we'd be losing all that much on the innovation-recognition front.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of individuals having special individual awards, like "Most Profane" or whatever else sounds like fun.  I agree with whoever mentioned above that it's also a good way to gently guide people's design ideas without introducing more constraints.<br/><br/>I think that's about it.  I'll opine more if I think of something.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126516/#Comment_126516" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:01:00+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, correlating time to polish is a red herring I think.<br/><br/>I can see both sides to the anonymity thing, and really, like Andy mentioned, people's styles out them pretty effectively anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126528/#Comment_126528" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:17:26+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:17AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 11:25AM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kleenestar</cite>Last year, latecomers (most of whom tended to be first-timers) got shunted into just a couple of groups.

I was aiming to make the contest as accessible to people outside the Forge for the first time ever (posting about it in places as diverse as d20 forums and even TheRPGSite IIRC), and someone (Mendel, maybe?) dropped that award. I felt like it would pretty much isolate the forge folk from the others, which is what I was trying to prevent last year.  It didn't, and I'm glad, and to that end if folks want to come in from left field with their unofficial "Hey I want to give a $10 award for the Best GMLess Game/Best Skype-Ready Game/Best Game With No Pants", I'm fine with that.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126585/#Comment_126585" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T12:23:33+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kleenestar</cite><br/>Last year, latecomers (most of whom tended to be first-timers) got shunted into just a couple of groups.  </blockquote>\nLast year, latecomers got put into groups that were created later, yes?

We ended up having to stagger them, like adding one member to the existing group, then the next three in a new group, then one more in a new group, three more in an existing group, etc. It looked, datawise, like a bathtub overflowing and gradually pooling out to fill up the room it was in.<br/><br/>Also, the problem with creating too many groups up front is that for the first 2-3 days, the spread out groups will only have about 2-3 people each. Eventually I imagine they will fill out, though. Also, it seems that the after-writing feedback is going to be more helpful than the actual participation feedback.

It's more like a masquerade ball. Everyone's got a mask. Some are elaborate. Some folks are going to come without masks, that's fine too. But it's a single event, not the cornerstone or foundation of an online community mid-build. And I'm hoping to have folks do a "reveal" at the end, maybe a final "Tell us who you really are, and tell us a little about yourself" thread when it's all over. If connections are made, they'll flourish from there. But the forum will be again locked down once the event is over and done.<br/><br/>So again, don't think of it as a community of anonymous folks attempting to build relationships but can not due to the anonymity. Rather, it's a single evening masquerade ball, where there's not even harm in deciding to simply come in a fancy suit with like one of those wire masks where everyone can totally see who you are anyway ("not using a pseudonym").<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126672/#Comment_126672" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T15:52:46+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  3:52PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went in with my real name last year.

The availability of a number of optional targets or points of focus can be really, really helpful -- whether just to get you thinking in that initial brainstorming stage, or to keep you focused in the later stages. Knowing that this criteria -- whatever it is -- explicitly exists really validates any effort you make towards that part of your game.<br/><br/>I mean, I think the only award in that category I actually aimed for didn't even result in a winner -- but I was still very grateful that the category existed, because it really helped me focus my game and gave me a lens through with to evaluate my progress. It didn't matter that it was arbitrary, or just one person's point of view. Really, I felt like the main contribution wasn't the final decision on a winner, it was <i>the choice of a category in the first place.</i> So criticizing the awards because the winners are 'just one person's opinion' is, to me, missing the real value in having those optional awards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127101/#Comment_127101" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T22:09:45+00:00" title="February 16, 2008 10:09PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) What did you think of the feedback groups?<br/>\nThey were nice, I got some feedback early one, gave little back myself except for being encouraging to others.

There's a tricky balance to strike between too big (such that it doesn't really solve the problem of not being able to get feedback) and too small (such that, if people drop out in your group or don't participate much, you could end up stranded). I wonder if it might not be possible to start out with small groups and merge them as people drop out somehow? It might work best to do that on a group by group basis: like, say you get to Tuesday and you realise you're the only one left in your group, post to an "orphaned chefs" thread and another group can adopt you?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Precisely 23.56% of participants should be pseudonymous. That is, it should not be mandated (some people use the contest as a way to get some name recognition, and there's nothing wrong with that in my view) and nor should it be "the norm", but I am happy for it to be "encouraged" as part of the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n* A peer review requirement strikes me as a good thing. Some people will be lazy about it and that's sad perhaps but unavoidable: meanwhile, a mandatory feedback requirement helps spread the attention that games get around a bit, and helps concentrate the mind - it's easy to get lazy about feedback, and the requirement serves as a neat reminder.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The forum software was fine, but I would like a re-skin, if only to stop me getting confused between there, here and KF all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Rather than the Past Winners Awards thing, how about we just encourage a culture of additional challenges? Anyone can make a post which is like "hey, I bet you can't make a game with the ingredients which also has THIS" and if people latch onto it, cool, and if not, that's just how it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n* In general, winning is much less interesting to me than just the natural process of buzz about one thing or another, plus the highlighting of particularly neat bits and pieces that should come out of the feedback process. Hence, I am bored by numerical scores, but totally interested in judging processes which are like "hey, THIS bit is totally cool! Check this out, people!" There should be a "winner", if only for the sake of Tradition, but not because they scored the most votes or got the best score out of ten. Embrace subjectivity!
