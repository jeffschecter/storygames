There's an optional phase 4, but if you're sapped for participation time/interest/whatever then that's absolutely okay too.<br/><br/>We made themed mix tapes. Broke into groups. Shuffled the tapes and drew one at random. We played a song and discussed our road trip, played a second song and wrote our characters. Our characters had a few traits, and cared about some stuff for the Future. Now, we would be ready to hit the open road (press play and start the first scene). But the internet is not a fertile environment for this game and so I feel like this exercise ends here.<br/><br/>Great. I had conversations with a few people about the process and the results. I played a (magnificent!) game of Long Road Nowhere at my place on Saturday, and got a chance to test some of that feedback. And now I have some questions.<br/><br/>If you'd like to, feel free to fill out this survey and email it to me at joethomasmcdonald, which is a gmail account. Don't post your answers in this thread, but DO use this thread to just talk about the experience.<br/><br/>SURVEY<br/>1.) Do you like (most of) your friends' music?<br/>2.) Did you feel like the second song was an interesting or a stupid restriction during character creation?<br/>3.) Would you feel disappointed if the actual gameplay used/riffed off the songs only minimally?<br/>4.) Do you listen to music while you game, typically? If so, how does a song (or doesn't it?) influence game tone?<br/>5.) Did you enjoy this process?<br/><br/>Cheers, everyone. If you'd like, I can post some of my thoughts and observations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165021/#Comment_165021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T15:47:29+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  3:47PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Joe.

I'm not terribly savvy at finding music I like, so I rely on a few friends in particular to know cool stuff that I can go hunt down.<br/><br/>2) I found it a cool constraint, especially since you don't have to base the whole character on the song if you don't wanna. I think especially if you're gonna have blind chargen it should be useful to have that common bond to link the characters (and I personally thought Highwayman's chars were coincidentally complimentary, alarmingly so). I kinda felt like the second song should be pulled from a different mix, though.<br/><br/>3) Yeah, on two levels: one, after putting all that work into a tape (don't get me wrong, creating a mix for it's own sake, <i>but</i>) it would seem a shame to not really use it. I was kinda disappointed, in fact, that we only used one tape for the experiment. And two, after all the inspiration that emerged from just the setup process, I'm totally jazzed about the mix tapes continuing to spur that creativity!<br/><br/>4) I used to try to do this, but dropped out of the habit. Mainly 'cuz, though other players kinda liked a bit of background noise, I was always going, '"Oh! This song! turn it up, this groove/these lyrics are <i>perfect</i> for this scene or character!" And everyone else just wanted to get on with the game. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> The one exception was a Dogs in the Vineyard game where I made a playlist, and Johnny Cash singing "I won't back down" came on at <i>just</i> the right moment, and everyone got tingles. But that was also a different group of folks.<br/><br/>Huh, <i>that</i> was a ramble. Have I answered the question?<br/><br/>5) <i>HELL</i> yes. I'm actually rather devastated that I won't be playing the game we set up. Johnny Thetic DEMANDS an authentic experience!<br/><br/>Thanks for doing this.

It was really well timed, and it just brought home the track in a big way.<br/><br/>I think that the play experience I had didn't do enough to riff off the tapes during play, so I need to think on that.<br/><br/>And in response to 5, I'm sorry. I did say at the very beginning that it would be a short, easy task. It grew from that into something bigger, but it hit its breaking point. The game simply won't work online in a way that I'll find exciting, and so someone else will need to run it for you. Over Skype it MIGHT work, but there are hand symbols involved in play (those could easily be replaced by a smiley in chat or something, but whatever).<br/><br/>I'm close to being finished the first write-up of a rule set, for the newly re-titled Ribbon Drive. When I have that done, I'll post here or elsewhere and people can explore how the game would have worked with these amazing characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166396/#Comment_166396" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T23:32:52+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 11:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I ABSULUTELY agree that it couldn't work online.
