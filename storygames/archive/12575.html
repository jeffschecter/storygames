I've read through it and find that I'm still unclear on a few things, so I'm hoping folks who've been play-testing it can provide some clarification.<br/><br/>So, Relationships.  I see the economy mechanic of Relationship Strength vs. Relationship Stress, and I get that one character can only ask so much of another before their bond gets strained or broken.  What I don't see is any mechanic for resolving conflicts between the characters in a relationship.<br/><br/>It's telling that this is the first thing I think about with my local group- I've already told them that this is a cooperative game, that they should be planning to work together as a team.  However, I know them, and I know that somebody is going to play a fuck-up, or otherwise cause internal conflicts.  I imagine that's where the Relationship mechanics kick in- but how?<br/><br/>So Mike (playing Oleg, the Professional) and Joel (playing Oleg's brother Yuri, a Civilian) are in a scene involving a hostage.  For the sake of argument, we'll say they both have a 3 Relationship with one another.  And now Oleg is asking Yuri to put a bullet in the hostage.  Mike wants Yuri to do it, for whatever reason, and Joel wants Yuri to stick to his convictions and his innocence.  Obviously, if he does it, Yuri's Relationship with Oleg will be broken (3-4 Stress) and Oleg might have to fix it later.  But how do we determine who gets their way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282409/#Comment_282409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T10:12:17+00:00" title="July 22, 2010 10:12AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your group needs dice:<br/><br/>If it's directly related to the Job, then it's a contested roll. Mike and Joel would both roll Provocateur via a contested roll. The rules for contested rolls in Operation would apply. The winner would get their way and the relationship would take stress.<br/><br/><br/>How my group does it:<br/><br/>The example of Brigid constantly trying to convince Sean to let her move in to his apartment is a real one. It'd come up at least once a scene, per scene that both Sean and Brigid were present in. Brigid and Sean never rolled; because they were part of the same team, they just argued in character until someone backed down. <br/><br/><br/>How I see it:<br/><br/>The Stress and Relationship mechanics aren't there to point PCs at each other. They're more like the natural wear and tear on parts of a machine. Sometimes you have characters that will naturally be more contentious than others, and that's normal; the important thing here is the why. <i>Why</i> is it important to Yuri that Oleg kills the hostage? Like I say in the introduction, the game is built on the premise that the characters care about each other. Is Yuri doing it for Oleg's own good? What's the deal? If you explore that in play, it should be easier for the characters to reach a consensus without going to dice, but the dice are there if you need them.<br/><br/>Graham wrote a great thing in A Taste For Murder called "On Tennis:" <br/><br/>"A family playing tennis, then, finds its own ways to settle rules disputes. Normally, they would discuss things reasonably, backing down before the matter became an argument. Perhaps they would appeal to neutral observers to settle decisions. Perhaps, as a last resort, they would toss a coin. However, it was always more pleasurable to continue the game than argue over rules."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282449/#Comment_282449" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T11:14:45+00:00" title="July 22, 2010 11:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 11:15AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>However, it was always more pleasurable to continue the game than argue over rules.</blockquote>\nWhat the hell kind of family did Graham grow up with? <br/><br/>&lt;/kidding&gt;<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback, Elizabeth.  The contested roll suggestion is great- I think most of the time it will go like your game, where the players just settle it through role-playing, but it's good to have a mechanic to fall back on.  <br/><br/>I had also considered that maybe your intent was that points in Relationship were like favors owed- a player essentially couldn't refuse as long as there were points to spend.  In that way, the Relationship that a player defines for his character (Yuri, for example) is a really a resource for another character (Oleg), to be used as he sees fit (within the fiction of their story and relationship).<br/><br/>Put another way, Blowback's relationships are like Shadow of Yesterday Pools that are associated with other characters- you can spend those points to accomplish your goals, but eventually you will run out and need to refresh the pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282467/#Comment_282467" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T12:08:56+00:00" title="July 22, 2010 12:08PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!
