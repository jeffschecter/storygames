But I feel something (maybe achey from laughter)!<br/><br/>But Captain Thark, if you want to write a game on RP Horses, Ill post one too.<br/><br/>There is even advice on some of them that get in-depth about RP techniques especially for forum based text RP.<br/><br/>I seriously am just in awe of all the peoples posts. Some of the ones I randomly clicked on were pretty sparse, but some had some legitimate content.<br/><br/>I wanted to get on there and play a Brumby (Australian name for a Mustang) that owned a set of polyhedral dice, that wanted to be a noble warrior-barbarian. I still sort of do. But I have to RP horses whenever I have baby-sat so I can pass up RP canters and prancing.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372187/#Comment_372187" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T13:49:32+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  1:49PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have long standing plans together with a few friends to infiltrate such a board.<br/><br/>We'd start by being Queen Starmane and her court who just arrived to Valley X being driven from their homeland by violent, brutish horses. Queen Starmane is pregnant, the foal being rightful heir to their homeland. The queen and her court are light, swift and beautiful horses that will try to make many friends in the community. They will be generous and friendly but always closer to each other than anyone else.<br/><br/>Then comes Bloodhoof the Stallion and his gang of heavy set draft horses. They are blunt, no nonsense and out to stop the foal ever returning to the homeland. They will speak frankly about the unjust aristocracy that was led by Starmane and her court and how the majority of horses were forced to seek grass in the badlands, the green pastures reserved for the royals and their flunkies and the scraps left for those who enforced this hierarchy. They will try to gather friends too.<br/><br/>Several times these groups will meet and just stomp their hooves and insult each other and talk about the <i>showdown</i>. When sufficient other horses are gathered the showdown happens suddenly! Bloodhoof and the rest attack Starmane just as she is about to foal and a fierce battle is fought! Horses are trampled, crippled, blood and dust is everywhere. Starmane's best friend Silverbloom has both her legs broken and begs a player she has befriended to put her out of her misery. Bloodhoof is killed or driven off but not before mortally wounding Starmane as she defends her foal. Starmane whispers faintly to the player she trusts the most and asks her to adopt the foal and raise him. Then she dies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372270/#Comment_372270" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T21:26:21+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  9:26PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still hold the pinnacle of "there's lots of strange roleplaying out there" to be back when I was idly hunting back in 2000-2001 or so, and found communities of people in play-by-post games of the theme of "Duran Duran goes on tour and saves the world".
