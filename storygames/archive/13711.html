It's a traditional action/adventure rpg set in a near future dystopia.  Sort of like D&amp;D if D&amp;D was inspired by dystopian fiction rather than pulp fantasy.  It's also strongly influenced by my early days playing <i>Rifts</i>.  I like to think of it as <i>Rifts</i> for the first-person-shooter generation.  In a lot of ways it's the spiritual successor to <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/manufacturers.php?manufacturerid=103" rel="nofollow">Empire of Dust</a>.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd love to hear what you make of it.  If you're interested in checking out the beta document, you can join the Red Moon Medicine Show <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/redmoonmedicineshow" rel="nofollow">google group</a> or email me personally at redmoonmedicineshow at gmail dot com.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
