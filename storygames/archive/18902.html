So yeah, what do y'all think about it? Here's my bite-sized AP report that I've ported from the other thread:<br/><br/>I'm a wee bit torn about DramaSystem. Today was only the second time I'd played it so I'm not that well-versed, but briefly, you get Drama Points (DPs) for conceding to another player's request- it could be a small thing each time but it gradually builds up to what they ultimately want from you, 'what I want from [name]' being a key part of char gen- and for something else I can't remember offhand, which you can spend on other things, most notably spending two (three?) DPs to force the other player to give you what you want. This is indeed important, but almost as important is that you can spend one DP to call someone to a scene or inveigle yourself into a scene. There's a <i>leetle </i>bit of meta-gaming involved- in that players will tend to push themselves into a scene if they see it as being one in which they want their character to have some influence, or if they can see something bad happening to their character, but it's not a big deal IMO and fits with the overall shakespearean theme of asides and listening in behind curtains etc. <br/><br/>The possible problem though is that when you spend 2 DP to force a conclusion to the scene, to get the other player to give you what you want, you're effectively telling the other player how to roleplay that scene. I know this happens in a variety of ways in a lot of indie games- forex in Fiasco, when you push forward a black or white die depending on whether you think the scene should end badly or well for the character- but there you still have a fair amount of agency, whereas in DramaSystem the effect seems particularly pronounced. Again, I've only played two games, and I'm only <i>slightly </i>ambivalent because overall I think it's a good system, but... Ok, in today's game, I'd promised to get the brash young returning noble (who was my son) to respect the social order and withdraw his threat of rebellion, which he was very unwilling to do, until I dumped 2 DP on him and said No, you've got to make some concession to Lord Whatsit, which momentarily flummoxed him because it wasn't the sort of thing his character would do. Then, later, one of the ruling Lords decided to force me to fulfil <i>his </i>objective, which was to kill my son, the rebellious noble. So I heaved a sigh and went into his chamber with a glass of wine on a salver, saying 'If you're determined on this course of action, will you at least have a glass of wine with your old father first?' But then he dumped 2 DP on me and said 'No you drink it'. To be fair, he did it via roleplaying , saying 'No, this glass is dirty, give me that one', but the point is that the DPs kinda forced our characters to act in a certain way. <br/><br/>On the other hand, pretty quickly the DPs were flying back and forth between us all, so there was a humungous amount of table turning throughout (which again was a good fit with the overall theme), but, eh, I don't know. As I say, overall a good system but with just that slight concern.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422804/#Comment_422804" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T17:18:57+00:00" title="October 13, 2013  5:18PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Needlessly complicated.  <br/>It reads a bit cumbersome; the free document anyway. <br/>It's like he took Fiasco and decided to simply add more shit to it.  <br/>Inelegant.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422816/#Comment_422816" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T22:16:13+00:00" title="October 13, 2013 10:16PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The second sentence of the free document is "It is not a teaching document structured to show you how to play and enjoy DramaSystem, but a reference document for writers and game designers to create their own products derived from DramaSystem." <br/><br/>I think the token economy is pretty brilliant. I haven't seen it in action in a campaign yet, and I think it'd flow better in a four hour session where you've already done full character creation and you know the rules already, but even in a one-shot it works reasonably well. I have now, twice, seen players who were natural spotlight monopolizers get cut off by the token economy. You're going to get your scenes, but you're not going to get to be in every scene and you're not going to get what you want by force of personality, which is slick.<br/><br/>The basic procedural system flows well enough in play. I feel like the red/yellow/green tokens are overly complex and I am trying to come up with a better way to handle them. It's especially annoying that procedural tokens carry over between sessions while drama tokens don't. I dunno, I'll keep pondering it. But the flipping cards and narrating the flow of the scene, I've seen that work well twice as well. Oh, and it handles PvP nicely.<br/><br/>I haven't tried the advanced procedural system yet but I'm not terribly driven to do so either.<br/><br/>I'm a touch leery about voting for bennies at the end of the game. I might try and come up with something else there. <br/><br/>I think it's a tougher game to GM than it looks like. The first time I ran it I did not do enough. I've seen that in other GMs too. I think you really need to build the pressure to keep the drama from getting circular and dull. The bits about tightening the screws seem pretty crucial.<br/><br/>Hm, and character agency. The dramatic poles are so key here. I don't have enough experience with them yet to know if I think they're enough. It's really important to pick poles that pull you in two directions and to pick desires that play into that. Tricky little thing about the character sheet: there's space to write down what everyone else's dramatic poles are. I bet that's on purpose, because you need to be aware of them and help the other players show them off.<br/><br/>I think in general Robin's game design work sometimes winds up better explained/taught by other writers. E.g., I like Esoterrorists as a setting and rulebook, but I would recommend Trail of Cthulhu as someone's first GUMSHOE RPG. I'm looking forward to the first new DramaSystem game. <br/><br/>I am looking for a DramaSystem game in San Francisco. Willing to run but would prefer to play.<br/><br/>One note from the other thread:\n<blockquote>Then, later, one of the ruling Lords decided to force me to fulfil his objective, which was to kill my son, the rebellious noble. So I heaved a sigh and went into his chamber with a glass of wine on a salver, saying 'If you're determined on this course of action, will you at least have a glass of wine with your old father first?'

In a dramatic scene, you're looking for a desired emotional reward, which in this case maybe would be "I want to establish that we're not pissed at each other," and then you're using the wine as a prop. If your son has another way to establish that the paternal bond is still in decent shape, that's kosher, or if he decides he wants to give and drink the wine cause it's cool RP, that's kosher. <br/><br/>If he decides not to give into your emotional desire at all, you get a DP from him. You could then force the issue by refusing it and pushing 2 DPs across the table at him instead, at which point he either has to give you your emotional desire or spend 3 DP to refuse. But there's no way he can (by the rules) force you to drink the poisoned wine; it's about whether or not he accepts or refuses your petition.<br/><br/>Still kind of a cool scene, but since it's a new game I think it's worth helping each other be clear about the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422820/#Comment_422820" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T01:00:05+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  1:00AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't write eloquently, because the GM who ran the game was the one who bought into the Kickstarter and I just learned it according to how he taught it (I haven't read the Dramasystem doc yet, though I did download it). We've also been "off-season" from our game for a few months now, so the game itself isn't fresh.<br/><br/>But I will say that it was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. The dramatic poles and the tokens and everything brought out some really dramatic storylines and plot twists. We even had a session towards the "season finale" where the GM was going to end the scene with my character being kidnapped. Then someone spent points to interrupt the scene and rescue my character. Then another player spent tokens to interrupt <i>that</i> scene because it would have ended with my character's rescuer shooting that character's father. Then it became PvP and the character protecting her dad lost. In my experience, it's pretty rare in a game to hear players gasp, but our game produced a lot of that. And a lot of, "Ooooh shiiiii......!" moments. More-so than <i>Monsterhearts</i> and you know that's got to say something.<br/><br/>I really feel like the way it worked did a great job towards mimicking tv dramas. I liked how the system sets it up that characters who are powerful in the fiction might not be powerful in the end. I <i>loved</i> the episode set-up, with an "episode" theme driving the fiction and people being rewarded to playing towards it. I feel like it kept the fiction a little tighter in most cases instead of there being a lot of milling around, so to speak, pursuing random tangents over the story as a whole. <br/><br/>I'm not suggesting it's the perfect system, but I feel like it has a lot of great points to it for a different sort of game than you might play with other systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422822/#Comment_422822" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T02:32:08+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  2:32AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2013 1:11PM by catty_big.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One note from the other thread:\n<blockquote>Then, later, one of the ruling Lords decided to force me to fulfil his objective, which was to kill my son, the rebellious noble.

And I would say that, despite the sight niggle I was expressing (looks like I didn't quite understand the rules is the explanation for that) it was an absolutely cracking game. The other players and I are all drawn to these kind of high-emotion, back-stabby games, and one more thing for the record: the GM set the game in a Gormenghast-type citadel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422823/#Comment_422823" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T04:55:13+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  4:55AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (If anyone missed it, the free SRD is <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=12485" rel="nofollow">here </a>in DOC form, and I <a href="http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/local--files/source:chris-sakkas/DramaSystem%20SRD%20-%20Libre%20Edition.epub" rel="nofollow">did an EPUB for it</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422825/#Comment_422825" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T06:23:34+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  6:23AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The other players and I are all drawn to these kind of high-emotion, back-stabby games, and one more thing for the record: the GM set the game in a Gormenghast-type citadel.</blockquote>\nIt sounds like a really fun game!

Also, what's all this about the game being designed for trad gamers? Take away the DPs and you have a game that could hardly be more narrativist. Is the idea that the addition of the DP mechanic is going to have huge swathes of D&amp;D and Pathfinder players slapping their foreheads and becoming overnight converts to collaborative indie gaming?

But the rules specifically address this issue. A force isn't mind control, and it doesn't require a character to completely change their perspective.

If you were told otherwise, the person who taught you the game was doing it wrong.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/cattybig">@cattybig</a> Based on your OP, you missed some important nuances in the rules. First off, the thing a character wants in a dramatic scene with another character is always emotional. One character can ask practical favors from another in a scene, but the petition is about the underlying emotional request. In the scene where the lord tried to get you to kill your son, the real petition might have been subservience, obedience, trust, or whatever. Basically, it sounds like the petition in that scene was illegal. <br/><br/>Second, as I said above, a force isn't mind control. Giving you a force definitely didn't require you to try to kill your son. You had leeway to display obedience (or whatever the emotional petition was) in a way that made sense in character and didn't necessarily involve fulfilling the practical favor the other character wanted.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/robb">@robb</a> Nah.

It\u2019s kind of \u2018Give ground on point x in order to win on point y or z\u2019, in other words, sometimes you have to lose the battle in order to win the war.

If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s quite an odd design decision, inserting a mechanic into a game of type x in order to make it palatable to folks who play games of type y or z. If you want trad gamers to play your game, why not just design a trad game?<br/><br/>But let's move on. As I say, I'd be interested to hear folks' thoughts on the Dramatic Poles and the relationships between characters. What have been some of your inter-character relationships, and what did you want from the other characters? Did you get what you wanted, and how did the overall narrative pan out?

Sometimes you'll reach clear consensus on what constitutes a major shift; in a few cases you\u2019ll have to vote.<br/>Even a force must respect the bounds of the granter\u2019s established character. You can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t expect to, turn an avowed enemy into a loyal friend in a single scene. Forced petitions represent the character giving in for the moment, not undergoing a life-changing epiphany. They certainly don\u2019t play like hypnosis or mind control. A force causes the subject to grudgingly act in a friendly, or friendlier than usual, manner in this particular instance.</blockquote>\nIt's tricky to get into the habit of thinking of the emotional subtext of apparently procedural exchanges, but once you think dramatically and look at the other characters emotional goals and your own it's much easier.<br/><br/>On playtesting - the game was widely and broadly playtested, with problems mainly confined to the procedural system.<br/><br/>This is a game designed for a series of sessions, developing the characters emotional interactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davidk" title="Davidk"><img alt="Davidk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davidk">Davidk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423164/#Comment_423164" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T17:09:09+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  5:09PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> Using / giving in to a force can be tricky. But the rules specifically address this issue. A force isn't mind control, and it doesn't require a character to completely change their perspective. It just requires some kind of shift of emotional energy in the direction of the petitioner. If anything, the requirements for a player who has been forced are squishy and allow lots of leeway.

(An experimental session two years ago with a way too small group, and that didn't go too well, + four sessions this spring which have gone very well.)<br/><br/>In our group we've found that the 2DT force is rare (but impactful when it does happen).<br/><br/>Some of the players have contrasted their experience with Hillfolk with Fiasco (with Hillfolk being received positively). In Fiasco, the die color the resolver choses has a lot of impact on how the scene is played out. In Hillfolk, many scenes are allowed to be played out "naturally". This is a Turku dream\u2665\u2665\u2665<br/><br/>You might decide to steer your play in one or the other direction because you want that coin. But that's a mode of thinking you can drop in and out of as you please, in your own head, without anyone else being disturbed. Which is awesome.<br/><br/>And only now and then your play is steered by a 2DT force. More rare than in other games we've played, such as the aforementioned Fiasco.<br/><br/>To me, Hillfolk brings back a lot of positive memories from 00:s LARP experiences. Like... "oh, yeah... this is what we were after then"...<br/><br/>We've changed the procedural system to basically be D&amp;D. Which has shown itself so far to be way more synergistic than dysergistic.

The key differences are:<ul><li> Cards: All cards have been removed from the game</li><li>Dramatic Moves: Drama tokens have been simplified to a single purpose with no color-codes</li><li>Procedural Moves: have been replaced by a PbtA-inspired system</li></ul>\nI've had prospective players and interviewers ask me about battles between forcing players; this seems to be one "weak spot" of the system that people notice pretty quick.  And while the possibility of getting into 2DT force likewise exists in the Malandros system, I've actually never had that sort of thing happen in play.  I suspect it comes down to the players at the table, and their willingness at such moments to push for the most <i>dramatic</i> thing, rather than the most <i>advantageous</i> thing.<br/><br/>This is definitely a matter of playstyle and taste, as has been discussed in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18901/when-is-your-characters-problem-not-your-problem" rel="nofollow">this thread over here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463885/#Comment_463885" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T18:44:37+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  6:44PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2017 6:55PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But what.
