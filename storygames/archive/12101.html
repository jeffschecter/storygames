I've been missing that week to week group dynamic that brings out the heart of so many games. Andy pointed me to a local RPG meetup and I'm going this Sunday to play Mouse Guard (yay!) with an entirely new group of people.<br/><br/>Wow, ack, hmm. I hope we get along and have similar gaming needs and compatible personalities. I won't feel bad to drop out if it doesn't work out, but I hope it does.<br/><br/>Any success stories out there about jumping whole hog into a new group? Any ideas on how to best present myself or gauge others so as to make sure we work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270961/#Comment_270961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T11:30:05+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 11:30AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 11:36AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great, Mark. <br/><br/>You are a  pleasant, approachable person, so I'd just be honest about what you want and need and encourage them to do the same.

This was back when D&amp;D 4E was first released, and I found myself a group for that via one of the Toronto gaming meetups. At about the same time, Ry was running some In a Wicked Age sessions with rotating players. That's how I finally managed to get around to playing an indie game, which I had been itching to do for the longest time. Once those sessions died out, a few of us put together a little group that works out like RPG book-club, playing different games for a handful of sessions at a time, and that's been going strong for a almost a year and half.<br/><br/>So, yes, meetups can work out great for meeting new people and forming new groups, and hopefully you'll be able to find the people that are interested in trying new things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271020/#Comment_271020" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T14:39:08+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  2:39PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just started a new group with myself and two other people who were part of a larger, long-running weekly game, plus one person we barely knew (who came to us, indirectly, through this forum, SG FTW). <br/><br/>I was a little worried about the social dynamics of it, but our first session last week went great. <br/><br/>I think focusing on the game helped. Once basic social graces had been observed, we got right to it.
