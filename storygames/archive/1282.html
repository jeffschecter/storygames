                    So, I have  this ridiculously difficult character sheet  to work with.<br/><br/>I like the sheet, but I was completely stumped with what to do with it until... well... half an hour ago.<br/><br/>The difficult bit was the colours CROSSREFERENCING the body/mind/aura bit.<br/><br/>So, here's what I have:<br/><br/>You are a Bringer. You have the ability to bring into this world elements of worlds that exist around you.<br/><br/>There are seven major "portal" worlds/planes/whatevers.<br/>One corresponding to each colour.<br/>You probably specialize in 1-2, but have your fingers in a total of 2-4.<br/><br/>I'm trying for a Hero/anime feel to the whole thing.<br/>Mysticism, Shapeshifters, Elemental Power, A Wise Emperor, A Low-Tech Culture.<br/><br/>Ex. (These are examples of what the colours might correspond to. I have none of them actually set yet.)<br/>Sudia is a disciple of the Red and Indigo schools.<br/>Red is the colour of the Rage Plane. Indigo is the colour of the Shadow plane.<br/>She has also dabbled in Yellow, the Nobility plane.<br/><br/>She is engaged in battle with another mage.<br/>She brings from the Rage (Red) Plane, focusing her energies on Mind.<br/>She thus creates an unescapeable bloodlust in her opponent - so strong that her opponent cannot act defensively or diplomatically in the next few rounds - she MUST act in attack.<br/><br/>Her opponent brings from the Shadow (Indigo) Plane, focusing his energies on the Body.<br/>He thus summons an Ethereal Shadow Beast, which attacks Sudia from the rear.<br/><br/>Sudia brings from the Nobility (Yellow) Plane, focusing her energies on the Aura.<br/>She thus creates a Ring of Awe.<br/>Onlookers - and her opponent - revel in her beauty and wisdom, and are amazed.<br/>Their actions are somehow affected.<br/><br/>Her opponent brings from the Shadow (Indigo) plane again, focusing on the Aura.<br/>He thus creates a Fog of Doubt, which confuses the onlookers and undoes the Ring of Awe.<br/>Meanwhile, since he's still channeling from the Shadow Plane, his Ethereal Shadow Beast lives on and attacks in a flurry of claws and choking mists. Sudia falls victim.<br/><br/>...<br/>and on and on.<br/><br/>Epic, majestic, mystic warriors.<br/>Phantasmal beings and alien powers.<br/>Political intrigue drawing comrades into combat.<br/><br/>That's the general idea of what I'm striving for.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, your heritage and past experience is a HEAVY influence.<br/>The colour of a character's skin (the white/black meter) affects how crowds judge you. Your facade (how you dress, appear... your mask) has a huge influence as well.<br/>Vitality/Integrity/Passion are drawn from past experiences, which can be visited during a flashback scene.<br/><br/>There will be lots of scene splicing, flashbacks, in media res scenes, timeline distortions, and "ah... so you thought, young one. But it is not so"'s.<br/><br/>What I need right now:<br/>-General feedback.<br/>-"Oh, check out this anime-ish thing."<br/>-"Oh, read/watch this."<br/>-Ideas on how to structure mechanics.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of narration like Polaris or Falling Leaves, but a crunchy tech-tree like thing for determining powerz. Somehow combining all that.                </div>

                            Yeah.<br/>Cool stuff with the Magic reference. I hadn't even thought of that, yet.<br/><br/>I want the personality... but more importantly the past... of the mage to come into play a lot.<br/><br/>I want racial inequality (white/black meter), gender inequality (hue), clan (Wisdom), appearance (Facade), and personal experiences (Vitality/Integrity/Passion) to all affect the course of battles.<br/><br/>I want battles to involve Bringing (summoning/spellcasting), but I also want them to involve diplomatic tactics, fierce debate, battles of wits, and general insightfulness.<br/><br/>I want there to be some kind of tech-tree for advancing in the Planes/Colours.                        </div>

                            new concept to add to this:<br/><br/>The game is all about heritage and background in a big way.<br/><br/>You are only able to refer to people by their Profession, their Race, their Gender or their Clan.<br/><br/>Their profession is Bringer.<br/>Their race is somewhere on the White-Black meter.<br/>Their Gender is listed under Hue.<br/>Their Clan is listed under Wisdom.<br/><br/>So... for example:<br/>I make a character.<br/>A female, from the O'Gasha clan. her skin is white as snowflakes. She is a bringer.<br/><br/>She has no name. Names do not exist within this glorious empire.<br/>You may call her "woman". Or "O'Gasha". Or "White O'Gasha" or "White Woman".<br/><br/>This:<br/>a.) Promotes tension between people.<br/>b.) Establishes that identity comes from background and heritage.<br/>c.) Ties in with the "key phrases" thing I'm thinking of incorporating.<br/>d.) Provides a framework for how societies are effected by these duels.<br/><br/>Certain things will flourish depending on your skin colour, gender, clan and profession.<br/>Maybe summoning is typically easier for men than women, and possessing is the realm of female bringers.<br/>Maybe casting from the Red Plane is easier for O'Gasha clanpeople than O'Ramma.<br/>Maybe those of fairer skin gain bonuses to the more direct and confrontational bringings.<br/><br/>When you are battling, the effects of battles establishes hierarchies in your society.<br/>If women beat men a lot, they are thus establishing a hierarchy where they are above men.<br/>This gives women a bonus in the future, in duels and all else.                        </div>

                            Joe,<br/><br/>I'm a big anime fan, and when I read your first post, I didn't think of anime. Anime-ish, maybe. I think thwaak hit it on the the head with the M:tG RPG, and that's totally cool. It also feels a bit like Exalted (flavor-wise) and over-the-top magical-martial arts movies, more than anime, per se. More Mahabharata.<br/><br/>Suggestions:<br/>Menu selection rather than tech trees? Mix "this" with "that": Rage + Mind = Inescapable Rage. That sounds awesome, without having the encumbrance of writing trees. If you want to detail things, you could plot out all the combinations and variations. If you want to see how trees work, for good and ill, check out Exalted (especially 2nd Edition). Most major bookstores have it, if you want to browse rather than buy.<br/><br/>Black/White is tricky for racism, since it's on a weird scale. How about Shade? This suggests morality. If you want to bring in character's pasts, how about Past Lives? They could be atoning for former lives or reaping karmic rewards. I note that there is no mid-point between Black and White - you're either Black-biased or White-biased.<br/><br/>Again, this is just my opinion, but I think it would be awesome to have color be the race thing: have *actual* violet-skinned people.<br/><br/>As for anime, if you want to watch something that may fire some ideas, check out Arjuna (AKA Earth Girl Arjuna). It's Captain Planet, if Captain Planet was a dead 14-year-old teenage girl. It's the closest thing to Nobilis: The Anime I've seen. Especially check out ep 7 (IIRC), the one about words.<br/><br/>A lot of anime is beautiful people with magick powerz and weaponz, and your concept is better than that.                        </div>

                            Okay, here's my thoughts:<br/><br/>Bringers are not born like other people. They are  birthed in fire.<br/>When nomads raid a village and burn it to the ground... the Royal Military might show up to the site days later, and find a small child giggling to itself, playing in the hot ashes.<br/>No burns on that child.<br/>And... it doesn't look like it was part of that village, either. It almost looks... slightly unhuman.<br/>It has a weird tint to its skin. Yellow. or Violet. or Blue.<br/><br/>Bringers are a mixture of fairy tale, nightmare, and reality.<br/>Sometimes a Bringer will become unbalanced and seek to destroy the Empire, or claim it for themselves.<br/>Sometimes a Bringer will be unwilling to accept the burden of responsibility, and will simply pretend they don't have it.<br/><br/>But most often, the Bringers will train. They will learn that their past is a secret weapon, and they will learn to wield it.<br/>Their skin is marked - they are attuned to worlds beyond our own.<br/><br/>Demons and ghosts and goblins exist in other planes.<br/>Great power, untold insights, and terrifying presences exist in other planes.<br/>And Bringers have the ability to tap into those other planes. Even if fleetingly.<br/><br/>They have the ability to merge worlds.<br/><br/><br/>Okay. So that's the background.<br/>Now... each colour is a Realm (Plane/Power/Force/Whatever).<br/><br/>Right now, I'm thinking this:<br/>Red is the realm of Rage.<br/>Orange is the realm of Endurance.<br/>Yellow is the realm of Nobility.<br/>Green is the realm of Life.<br/>Blue is the realm of Movement.<br/>Indigo is the realm of Shadows.<br/>Violet is the realm of Death.<br/><br/>That White/Black tracker... it represents your lifeforce. Place a marker bead on White.<br/>As you battle, if you take damage... you slowly edge towards Black. Black represents the ash you were born from and will again return to one day.<br/><br/>As you fight, the more damage you take... the more your body slowly turns to ash.<br/>Picture two warriors, sailing through the air as they leap between buildings. Flashes of light and colour ignite the sky, and mythical beasts you have never seen erupted from empty patches of air.<br/>All the while, a light rain of ash is fallling from the sky. And you know one of them is dying.<br/><br/>They are given 30 points. At least 10 must be put into their primary realm.<br/>The points are divided up amongst the square boxes to the right of the colours.<br/><br/>Ex. Thomas is making a character.<br/>He says that his primary field is Blue.<br/>He has 30 points to build his character, of which 10+ must go into Blue.<br/>He puts 3 in Blue/Body, 4 in Blue/Mind, and 4 in Blue/Aura.<br/>He puts 4 in Indigo/Body, 2 in Indigo/Aura, and 3 in Red/Body.<br/><br/>That's 20 points spent so far.<br/><br/>He then fills in three memories: One of Vitality, one of Integrity, and one of Passion.<br/>During fights, he can initiate Flashbacks to these things, and use them to keep fighting on.<br/>He needs to put points into them for them to be useful. He puts 4 into Vitality memory, 4 into Integrity memory, and 2 into Passion memory.<br/><br/>Ex. Silvia is making a character.<br/>She has 30 points, and must put at least 10 into her main Realm.<br/>She picks Indigo (shadow) and puts 10 into Body, 6 into Mind, 10 into Aura.<br/>She puts 4 into Orange (Endurance)/Body.<br/>(She thus has no power in her memories, but still fills them out. She might put some points in from advancement later).<br/><br/>And... I'm not sure how actual play works yet.                        </div>

Good. I'm totally using white/black as a lifebar then, with black meaning "dead ash" and white meaning "living ash".<br/><br/>And ash will fall from the fucking sky, when these warriors clash.

I love it. This totally ties into other parts of what I am thinking, too:<br/>Shame, Honour, Respect, Reverence, etc.<br/><br/>The idea is that it will have key phrases like Polaris, that govern the stages of a fight/war/scene. And in between those key phrases, there is crunchy epic asskicking.<br/><br/>So a keyphrase might be "Bringer, do not allow yourself to become a beast." which means 'spare my life, please'. The Bringer would have two choices for how to act: mercifully (gaining them something. Maybe they take some of the surrendered opponent's power), or mercilessly (killing them, and gaining something else back. Maybe rank, or something.)<br/><br/>This would mean that me sparing your life shifts the way that our proxy-clans interact in the future. A simple humane act on the Bringer level could mean catastrophic things on the political/national level.<br/><br/>Kickass.                        </div>

                            Joe,<br/><br/>You're definitely on to something here. What if Bringers hit the end of the black-ash spectrum...and become monsters? The Empire needs them *and* fears them - they're walking nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>Oh, and how does one buy a copy of Perfect, then? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Matthew Gandy -<br/><br/>Kickassness. Maybe keeping your powers in check helps preserve your life-bar thing too. Exerting too much opens you for weakness.<br/>That way... your power gets big. You use it. Someone drops your ash count to black, and the only thing left of you is that huge, alien power. A monster.<br/><br/>And... Perfect is here: www.incitefulentertainment.com<br/>But its undergoing a few edits post-Gencon, so it won't be available for order for another few weeks.<br/>Sorry about that.                        </div>

...oh.<br/><br/>So hey, make the outside-the-arena bit just as important if not more important as the in-the-arena bit.  Cause that's the interesting part of the setting to me.<br/><br/>Cause like: my character, the Violet Swan, happens across another Bringer, Golden Harmony, in a tavern late at night in the imperial city.  There's some banter, and then she mentions that the lover that Swan had taken is in fact an agent of another Bringer who's going up against me in a few days.  So I'm suspicious, and I confront him about it, but after some appropriate system-invocations I find out that he's actually working for Harmony, to plant seeds of suspicion in me about the minor fight coming up so I'll overcommit, making me weakened for the fight against her that her clain is putting on the schedule right now...<br/><br/>Man, I don't even need to go into the arena!                        </div>

                            Josh...<br/>how do I do all that stuff, taking in the sheet I have?<br/><br/>I don't even know how to do the in-arena stuff yet.<br/><br/>...I'm sincerely thinking about dropping the competition, and designing this game... without the constraints of that character sheet.                        </div>
