Reincorporation is when you take an element that was brought in to the story early, and change it's meaning by revealing it to be connected to a later, often climactic, development.  It's different than foreshadowing, because the connotation of reincorporation is that when you introduce the thing, it has no connections, but when a later plot point is revealed, it gets assigned.<br/><br/>For instance, in some <i>Scooby Doo </i>a rpg with shared narrative control, one player might introduce an old caretaker early on in the game, and, at the end, another player might narrate that they unmask the ghost to reveal... that old caretaker who we met in the first session!<br/><br/>I wanted to get into it a little bit because it will illustrate a fundemental difference between a couple of different playstyles.  You'll have to bear with me because you guys will probably have vocabulary that I don't know for a lot of the stuff that I'm talking about. <br/><br/>In games where everyone understands the past, present, and future of the game world is always in flux (such as improv games), reincorporation seems like it would always be awesome.<br/><br/>But, in some cases, reincorporation could be taken as a betrayal of trust.<br/><br/>In some styles (generally simulationist/illusionist, but I'm leery of using those terms), players expect certain aspects of the game world, like past events, to be set in stone.  In these games, players are often trying to solve a mystery or find a quest item.  So, if a player creates a game element in the process of the adventure and then the GM incorporates it into the past events of the plot, it's innapropriate.<br/><br/>Example- as an aside in a Shadowrun adventure where the heroes are looking for a serial killer, a player says "I go buy a red leather jacket".   Later, the DM reveals that the killer they are looking for "always wears a red leather jacket", a fact which gets the player mistaken for the killer.  It's a cool plot element, but the player gets mad.  His choices are supposed to be protected from involvement in unconnected elements of the game world.  <br/><br/>In these games, the GM's keys may react to the players only through direct consequences of the PC's actions.  Huge, far-reaching developments, inspired from direct consequences, are great.   But even trivial connections inspired from unconnected actions feel like a gyp.<br/><br/>If the DM omnisiently changes the unnconnected world around them to react to their actions (and especially if he changes the past), he's cheating.  It's the kind of a thing where the players might not know he's cheating, but could easily guess it if he uses something as overt as the leather jacket example.  This can be done intentionally, as part of the "illusion" of illusionist games.  But, in some circles, there's a morality issue here.  Reincorporation can be a cheat, unless it can be introduced as a product of direct, consequential repercussions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92587/#Comment_92587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T10:52:02+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 10:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's interesting. I get that.<br/><br/>In improv, you're meant to have no preconceptions about what you bring into scenes. So, if you bring in a red leather jacket, and someone later says "There's a killer with an identical jacket", you're not really <i>meant</i> to get pissed off about it. They're advancing the story: so roll with it and build on it.<br/><br/>In roleplaying, <i>generally</i>, I also think people ought to roll with it. But I can see it might be a problem.<br/><br/>When I reincorporate when GMing, there's generally some negotiation:<br/><br/><i>Me: So the police are hunting this killer and...how about he's got a red leather jacket, like yours?<br/>Player: Oh...no...I don't want that.<br/>Me: Oh, OK. So they're hunting a killer with, say, purple hair.</i><br/><br/>and that negotiation might help.<br/><br/>Hey, Remi? You said something on a podcast about how you hated being endowed with stuff while roleplaying.

For the most part, I'll never know whether or not the history we're learning is what the GM had in mind all along or not. But that sort of power also comes with the responsibility to (you guessed it) not be a dick. Bear in mind that your dramatic complications may be viewed as dickery.<br/><br/>To use the red jacket example, switching it over so that the killer always wears a red jacket is fine. If the player wants to play out a scene where he gets mistaken as the killer he'll have that option. Played right he may even be able to learn some of the stuff that the police never tell the newspapers, and come away with some extra info for his troubles. But to simply say "and oh yeah, the killer always wears red, so you get arrested" is probably an abuse of power.<br/><br/>Also be wary of coincidences. For example, if the killer really does always wear a red jacket, and has since you thought up the adventure six weeks ago, you might even want to consider changing that tidbit when the PC buys a red jacket, if your group's dynamic is such that it would look like you're screwing the guy over because of a choice he meant as flavor text for his PC's appearance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92592/#Comment_92592" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T11:06:00+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 11:06AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A changing relationship might be another sort of this (I think...)<br/><br/>In Act 1, the NPC is just a bespectacled hot librarian with info the players need.<br/><br/>In Act 3, she's romantic interest for the burly monster-fighter as they try to get through a date without vampire gangsters messing up the pasta.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92595/#Comment_92595" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T11:15:44+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 11:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also wanted to add that reincorporation can be cool, but be careful about doing it to people and things that someone has invested resources into.

It's consequential.  Reincorporation would be if you met the sexy bookkeeper, forgot about her, and later on it is revealed that she was the head vampire.  Or, later on it is revealed that she was a childhood friend of the player.  It doesn't directly follow the actions that the players established, but recontextualizes the meaning of the introduction of that element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92686/#Comment_92686" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T21:48:05+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  9:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2007 9:52PM by Remi.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>A shocking twist like that isn't possible in an improv-style game where the world is in total flux.</blockquote>\nI'd just like to point out that in improv the scene is NOT completely fluid past the first few lines. Whatever you set out is set in stone, or should be. To do otherwise would be denial of the worst sort. You can justify 'mistakes' and things that don't jibe with what was set up, and a lot of fun can come out of that, but simply stating things that are in contradiction to the established reality is  a pretty big no-no (although, like all rules, I've seen it broken to great effect. It has to be done very thoughtfully, though.)<br/><br/>I'd also like to say, again, IMPROV IS NOT ROLEPLAYING. They operate by different rules and almost always have different goals and different ways of approaching character, story, set-up, etc. Just because you reincorporate characters (JD's example is excellent), doesn't mean that you're suddenly playing a monkeys on the moon scene at the <a href="http://www.ucbtheatre.com/" rel="nofollow">UCB</a>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Remi was saying there had to be a change of context, which is probably a fair point.

If I used the words interchangeably, I apologize. Recontextualization just means that a different aspect of whatever's being reincorporated is shown. In an RPG, at least, reincorporation  can just reveal something new and interesting about an already-existing element, without fundamentall changing that element.<br/><br/>In Young Adult RPG the reincorporation is done specifically by 'revealing' how an element participates in a larger, established, 'Weird Thing', and something previously unknown can be established through this process ('The Principal is actually a vampire!'). This has to be understood before you even start the game, though, so it doesn't really apply to this conversation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Hey, Remi? You said something on a podcast about how you hated being endowed with stuff while roleplaying. This is similar, isn't it?</blockquote>\nI don't like things being DIRECTLY endowed on my character in games where my character is <i>what I have</i>. I'd have no problem with the red jacket example ("Police today announced that their leading suspect in the Bayside High murders wears a red jacket with a blue and yellow pill on the back. Be on the lookout for this distinctive garment"), because it doesn't actually say anything about my character. I get to decide if I'm the killer or not. I'd have a real problem with someone simply endowing me with, "You are actually the killer." I'd be stuck with that for the rest of the game, and it says something about my character, which is what I have in the game. Does this make sense as a distinction?<br/><br/>I think James McMurray's point about not heavily altering something someone has invested a lot of currency in is salient and well-put.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>His choices are supposed to be protected from involvement in unconnected elements of the game world.</blockquote>\nThis mode of playing is totally alien to me. Assume anything I say about gaming doesn't apply to this style of play. That said, I think your example says more about the mode of play (players have no agency in the game if bad things happen to them, and so are afraid of dramatic turns) than about reincorporation. I don't understand how the game works if all of the elements have to be at the table at the front of the game, and anything applied beyond that is seen as 'cheating'. Am I misreading? Is there a place for new information to be introduced that can put characters in a difficult situation that won't be 'cheating'? Isn't a sense of interconnectivity important to a simulation? I am trying to ask these questions from a place of honesty, and if a new thread is needed to address them, I will do so.<br/><br/>(EDIT: Jason, I didn't address your final point because I felt I had gone on long enough, I hope some of my answers have addressed your concerns. JD's example is totally reincorporation.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92767/#Comment_92767" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T11:40:40+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 11:40AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2007 12:02PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>A shocking twist like that isn't possible in an improv-style game where the world is in total flux.</blockquote>\nI'd just like to point out that in improv the scene is NOT completely fluid past the first few lines.

Is there a place for new information to be introduced that can put characters in a difficult situation that won't be 'cheating'? Isn't a sense of interconnectivity important to a simulation?</blockquote>\nYes, a sense of interconnectivity is very important, but it is best created by utilizing existing facts.   Again, this pertains to games where the players assume certain facts do exist, even though they have not yet been revealed.  Regarding the librarian- if it was pre-set that she was the head vampire, when the player eventually finds out, they can say "that explains why she would never go on dates during the day!", and it would be a real revelation to the player, rather than a manufactured one.  If she was adapted to be a vampire after introduction because it seemed like it would be a cool connection, the player can think "oh yeah that's clever", but they could never think "holy shit I can't believe I missed that!"<br/><br/>The cheating idea, (and this is what this thread is examining) is when the DM takes player choices, and uses them to change elements that he had ostensibly pre-prepared.  For instance, say the characters have spent days following clues to find the evil vampire hideout and failing, so they go to McDonalds out of boredom, and the DM says "Surprise,this Mcdonalds happens to be the vampire hideout!".  It's a break in the trust that the players have about elements of the world that were supposed to be set in stone. It wouldn't be a problem in improv (where no one is expected to be hiding pre-existing elements of the gameworld), but is a breach of trust in, for instance, a simulationist game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite> I don't understand how the game works if all of the elements have to be at the table at the front of the game, and anything applied beyond that is seen as 'cheating'.</blockquote>\nNobody expects that every minute detail of the game world exists at the outset of the game.  However, the players expect  certain main plot elements to exist and be somewhat fleshed out before they start the game, and feel cheated if those expectations are not met.  One example that has been used to describe this kind of irritant- when the players look at a map of the country, decide to go to a random city, and find that any city they choose turns out to contain "The fortress of the witch king".  It can be a beautiful thing to use your player's choices to create new elements of the game world, but it can also be a betrayal that makes the players feel as if nothing they do really matters, because the world will just change to adapt to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92774/#Comment_92774" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T12:16:08+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 12:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>However, the players expect  certain main plot elements to exist and be somewhat fleshed out before they start the game, and feel cheated if those expectations are not met.</blockquote>\nWho's players?  Your players?<br/><br/>I will note that this is a generality that isn't 100% met.  My own play group is a good example, because they let me GM and I take my cues from the players.  I generally know the first scene and the last scene for a given session, and some ideas on how to fill the void in between if they come up dry, with the provision that my endcap scene my change dramatically or be thrown out entirely if something else they do causes that to happen -- is that "certain main plot elements" not existing?  In fact, they expectations are met when it's my turn to GM, because they tend to enjoy the amount of impact they have as players on the story.  (But this is just to point out that you're speaking in a false generality than anything else.)<br/><br/>I also wonder if perhaps "a case of mistaken identity with the killer &amp; one PC" could be a plot point that the game starts out with -- a plot point that was set up at the outset of the game and held secret in the GM's head.  From the player's point of view, what's the difference between:<br/>* "Okay, he's buying a red leather jacket?  Now I'll spring the 'mistaken identity' plot element on them that I've been setting up from the beginning."<br/>* "Oh, a red leather jacket?  Sure, the killer could have one, too.  Oh!  Mistaken identity!  Sweet!"<br/><br/>So, what you could be mad about is either a decision made on a whim or a plot point that just now happened to manifest itself.  Are these both "reincorporation"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92788/#Comment_92788" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T12:44:50+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 12:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I am really lost.

That's the wonderful thing about RPGs, especially RPGs with lots of prep. You can sit and consider whether reincorporating an element in a certain way is interesting and in keeping with the spirit of the game or not. After a few sessions, you're bound to have characters you want to bring back and highlight different aspects of. Reincorporation is an easy way to remind yourself to conserve your worldbuilding resources, as that will make them more meaningful and interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92808/#Comment_92808" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T13:58:23+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  1:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>Jason, I am really lost.

If you use the term in the general sense of "bringing back and expanding upon previous story elements", I agree that it is always a good thing.  <br/><br/>In some games, perhaps PTA for example, it is a good thing when used <i>precisely</i> in an improv-ey way. <br/><br/>As far as I know, RPGs do not have a great term for this technique of immediately incorporating the PC's choices into the metagame of the world . So, this is an attempt to co-opt the lingo for use in discussing RPGs.  The reasons that I felt that we needed a word for it is that I thought it illustrates what I think is an interesting and qualitative difference in playstyles, which is this idea of how malleable the existing world is.  I was hoping to show that there are games when overt malleability can weaken a game session.  That's what my Leather Jacket and McDonalds Lair examples were meant to show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92809/#Comment_92809" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T14:04:54+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  2:04PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2007 2:05PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>From the player's point of view, what's the difference between:<br/>* "Okay, he's buying a red leather jacket?
