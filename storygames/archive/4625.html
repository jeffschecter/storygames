I'm also a big fan of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108108/" rel="nofollow">"Sharpe's" series</a>. I like me some Napoleonic setting. But, there's no game for it. Well, there's wargames with miniatures of whole regiments, but (at least as far as I know) no RPG I'm willing to try.  But I've been haunted by the thought of trying Agon for it. Bear with me.<br/><br/>First off, I couldn't find my copy of Agon anywhere - if you have it, please return it. Or don't - I already ordered a new copy, this time with PDF I can sneak looks at while working. Here's what I'm thinking:<br/><br/>Name Die = Rank Die<br/>Heroic Traits change to things like Noble, Brave, Chivalrous, Honourable, Keen, etc.<br/>Instead of a patron god/goddess you have your military specialty: Grenadiers, Hussars, Sappers, Fusiliers, Lancers, Dragoons, etc.<br/><br/>Sword = Sabre<br/>Spear = Bayonet<br/>Javelin = Pistol<br/>Bow = Carbine, Musket, or Rifle (depending on military specialty)<br/><br/>Haven't done the abilities yet, but seems like it'll be fairly straightforward. <br/><br/>For inspiration, look only as far as the <a href="http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgtitle_tree.cfm?level=1&amp;title_id=269277" rel="nofollow">Vinkhuijzen collection of military uniforms</a>. <br/><br/>Obviously, there won't be Gods and Monsters, but there might be a few heroes vs. a whole slew of enemy soldiers, which is like a monster, right? or against a cunning Portuguese bandit captain, or a legendary French sappeur who beheads people with his monstrous axe. <br/><br/>Does this thing have legs? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104542/#Comment_104542" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T07:41:56+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  7:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>I just recently watched<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075968/" rel="nofollow">The Duellists</a>.

Overtly they are working together as a squadron but covertly they are all jostling for glory, mentions in dispatches, prize money and that elusive promotion to Commander.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105095/#Comment_105095" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T01:30:49+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  1:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, this is cool.<br><br>To get the Napoleonic combat feel, maybe you limit firearms to one shot per engagement (or until both sides disengage to reload).
