Which ones were the first to dispense with the concept of the GM, which were the first to embody the different types of GMless games and which were the ones that sparked the imagination of other designers and properly established the practive. I made up a partial list of modern games on RPGgeek that are category of GMless. <br/><br/>Just from this, it looks as though the first big splurge came in 2005 though I'm not sure if they were reacting to something released that year or something from 2004 or something not on the list!<br/><br/><i>(Note, the two dates are for games that had a public release significantly before their final first edition.)</i><br/>1998 1998 The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen<br/>2001 2001 De Profundis <br/>2002 2002 Universalis<br/>2004 2006 Polaris<br/>2004 2004 Faces <br/>2005 2006 The Shab Al-Hiri Roach<br/>2005 2005 Capes <br/>2005 2005 Breaking the Ice <br/>2005 2007 Contenders <br/>2005 2005 Best Friends <br/>2005 2005 Bacchanal <br/>2005 2005 Engle Matrix Games <br/>2005 2005 It Was a Mutual Decision <br/>2006 2006 Mythic Role Playing<br/>2006 2006 Shock<br/>2006 2007 The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries <br/>2006 2006 Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan <br/>2007 2007 Grey Ranks<br/>2007 2007 Dirty Secrets <br/>2007 2007 How to Host a Dungeon <br/>2007 2007 Until We Sink... <br/>2007 2007 Stoke - Birmingham 0-0 <br/>2007 2007 Heart of the Rose <br/>2007 2007 Archipelago <br/>2007 2007 Hikikomori <br/>2007 2007 Fuck Youth <br/>2007 2007 Zombie Porn <br/>2008 2008 Zombie Cinema <br/>2008 2008 Western City <br/>2008 2008 Shooting the Moon <br/>2008 2008 Geiger Counter<br/>2008 2008 Under my Skin <br/>2008 2008 It wasn't me!

The essay describes a collaborative role-playing framework which does away with the GM altogether (there's no concept of a "GM rotation" here) and in doing so it sure anticipates a number of features of play which became staples of 21st century RPGs, such as shared ownership of NPCs or agreeing on a purpose before playing out a scene (I'm thinking of this in a PTA way, though I can't quite remember how it exactly shaped up in Ergo). I do remember there was a lot of pre-negotiation of things going on in Ergo's framework, which sounds plain and unexciting by contemporary standards but was back then a necessary piece of groundwork and, if you think about it, is still the baseline of sorts we test the specific strengths of a new system against.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how aware of <i>Munchausen</i> the author was, but Millington was apparently coming at this from a different angle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447268/#Comment_447268" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-27T08:39:23+00:00" title="July 27, 2015  8:39AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_game#Alternate_form_role-playing_games" rel="nofollow">according to Wikipedia</a> the first Matrix Game by our resident Chris Engle was created "c. 1988", not 2005, though I didn't check whether it used a fixed referee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447272/#Comment_447272" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-27T15:10:06+00:00" title="July 27, 2015  3:10PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matrix Games often stilled used a referee.

The interest on the topic in 2004 basically originated in the analytical deconstruction that'd been going on in 2002-2004 on the nature of the roleplaying game act; the way I remember it, many of those games were natural outgrowths of the deconstruction of the GM that was done at the time, and reactions to e.g. My Life with Master and other such games with highly structured (and therefore deconstructable) GM roles. (Look at <i>Contenders</i> for an example of what MLwM looks like without a GM - I've got a similar thing in my desk drawer, as I imagine many people who followed the discussion at the time do.) Universalis as well, of course - it caused a lot of excitement for raising so many questions about the nature of creativity in roleplaying.<br/><br/>At the time the GMless games weren't considered particularly special in comparison to GMed games. Three years on people would be talking about GMless as a specific technical preference even, but it took time for that perception to grow to its current extent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447340/#Comment_447340" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T14:21:08+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  2:21PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heck, these days if you ask 10 RPGers what "indie RPG" means, 6 of them will say it means "GMless".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447352/#Comment_447352" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T16:53:48+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  4:53PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2015 4:54PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I myself have a "GMless" game I wrote in 2005.

Solitaire play has a long history in war games. Solo play was pretty common given the difficulty of finding an opponent. There are apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_board_wargame" rel="nofollow">non-miniatures commercial wargames that date to 1974</a>. Don Featherstone's Solo Wargaming was published in 1973.<br/><br/>And, of course, while the referee is critical if you're running a free kriegspiel, the free kriegsspiel referee was a development from von Reiswitz's much more constrained confidant. And from there you can trace kriegspiel back to chess, which hasn't ever had a referee. Though this is admittedly getting rather far afield from the original question about modern gmless games. It does show that the gm-role has evolved in myriad different ways. <br/><br/>I suspect the mostly-unstated-in-the-rules Braunstein-derived free kriegspiel elements of D&amp;D were the catalyst for the game catching on like it did, so the GM-as-god-of-the-game thing became the assumption. I'm not familiar with any evidence that suggests that players or designers at the time recognized that, though someone who was there might have a better idea. I'd guess that it was more unexamined assumptions forming the play culture piecemeal as they found things that worked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447419/#Comment_447419" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-30T17:39:55+00:00" title="July 30, 2015  5:39PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            T&amp;T had solo play also                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447480/#Comment_447480" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T13:53:41+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  1:53PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's probably a bright line to be drawn between GMless play and solo play, the latter usually meaning "programmed instruction", which as I recall is what T&amp;T offered.

A no-referee wargame, where the rules theoretically simulate every possibility, is a very different kind of thing than a group-as-co-GMs thing. <br/><br/>Not that that stopped some players from actively narrating their after action reports, but that's definitely a story-later thing, with first person accounts after the fact rather than roleplaying in the moment.<br/><br/>Solo adventure books have seen a bit of a comeback recently.

Love that game.<br/><br/>Yes, the basic GB rules are basically Prohibition Era skirmish rules*. It can be played GM-less, just like a wargame. It does include a CYOA style training module as well, involving cops tracking down a Not-Dillinger Dustbowl bank robber and gang.<br/><br/>Campaign play needs a Ref, and gets a little weird. I understand the original game that it developed out of was a bit more like an ongoing, open-ended Braunstein. It hints at this style of play, but I can tell you that as a kid playing GB, those hints went right over my head. Instead, we played it essentially like any other sort of team RPG, deciding early on whether we were playing cops <b>or</b> criminals, not a mishmash of both with whole gobs of players being involved.<br/><br/>There are a number of semi-rpg wargame campaign systems that have story before/after/between play elements, with players often adding some characterization that comes out during play, if that makes sense. Fro what I can tell from running down some of these and their predecessors, they seem more like a parallel line of game development alongside RPGs. They may or may not have GMs at all, or ad-hoc refs only. It's a bit all over the place.<br/><br/><br/>*A number of TSR boxed games included some kind of "training" skirmish scenario meant too be played to learn the game, prior to a proper GM +PCs type rpg set up was engaged in for further play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447530/#Comment_447530" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T19:00:18+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  7:00PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call on En Garde!

It's been a great help. <br/><br/>Regarding definitions and solo play, that's kind of the reason I named this thread 'modern gmless' gaming. Going back, I could find the odd game from the 70s and 80s listed as GMless. What we have today, though, is a pretty clear tradition of GMless games and I wanted to use this thread to go back to where we didn't have such a tradition and find where this most recent incarnation gathered cohesion.<br/><br/>Based on these posts and having done a bit of digging around on the Forge and other places here what I'm currently feeling:<br/><br/>Several of the '2005 crop' were from designers active on the Forge. It seems likely that their games came from the discussions there about breaking up the GM role. Those discussions in turn may have arisen spontaneously, but I think it would likely have been influenced by the publication of Universalis. Mike Holmes has told me that in the creation of Universalis they were pointed at Nomic.  <br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic</a><br/><br/>One thing I'm still wondering about is the influence of Ian Millington.

Both games early on had modules that were divided by chapter. Chapters tended to be 1-3 pages long, and there was no actual reason that you couldn't rotate the GM spot from chapter to chapter.<br/><br/>So for me, a lot of GM-less games were just a step or two further down that path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447575/#Comment_447575" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T14:28:50+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  2:28PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>OK, now, here's an interesting question, that Jason's post raises: do we want to differentiate between GM-less and GM-ful?</blockquote>\nSometimes either of those two words are used in a way that includes both.

Now they are totally GMless. I think the reason my stuff is listed in 2005 is that is when I started posting on the Forge and thus came to this communities attention. <br/><br/>I agree that En Gard is an influence on me. It is so different from DnD, another influence. I never played Ars  Magica. I played a lot more miniatures games in the late 80's and 90's. Some minis game rules are very simple and fast (more are not). I imagine it all comes back to what made us begin to trust the player's creativity and let go of anal control. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447859/#Comment_447859" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T20:42:15+00:00" title="August 10, 2015  8:42PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2015 10:59PM by Paul_D_L.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started gaming around 1990 and within a few years, I knew dozens of people who played original games or games so heavily homebrewed that they might as well have been original. Not most, but certainly some of those games were GMless, floating scene GM, diceless, etc.<br/><br/>A potentially big difference is that I don't remember anyone remotely considering publishing back then - partly because most of these games were the hobbies of teenagers. Certainly their ambitions grew as they grew, but the ubiquity of the modern internet also played a big part in turning a sort of diaspora of hobbyists doing their own things into a public community. How much The Forge plays into the publishing dates is something I can't say, but it's difficult for me to put much credence in 2005 or any other single year in the last 20 or more years as a particularly meaningful one in the evolution of the form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
