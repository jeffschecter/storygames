This one starts with a special shout-out to Hans, who let me in on a spot that he got to first.<br/><br/>Everybody knows how Lady Blackbird works by now, right?  You start off as detainees on an imperial cruiser flying the Wild Blue, your owlship locked in its hold, your mission rapidly on its way to being compromised by the captain's criminal record.  To achieve your goals and get out of there, you try to beat the GM's target number of successes by rolling Xd6, where X is 1 + a trait and all its applicable subtraits + expendable dice from your personal pool.<br/><br/>In our game, going around the table, we had Christian Griffen as a frightening and distinctly Teutonic Naomi; Lesley McKeever as Natasha Syri, Lady Blackbird, playing the Leia/Inara mix to the hilt with a little Willow thrown in; Lukas Myhan as a sort of Groucho Marxian Snargle; Matt "Mister" Wilson as a skillful, loyal, greedy Kale; and me as Cyrus.  I don't usually go in for the male-lead roles, but the rest of the group made it very easy to step into this one.<br/><br/>ACT ONE<br/><br/>We started off in dangling cages--boys in one, girls in the other--watching the guards in the center of the room play whist, while Naomi and Kale itched to bust out and Cyrus and Natasha urged caution.  Eventually the captain of the ship turned up to let Natasha out, since he'd received the bulletin warning that she'd been kidnapped and urging her safe return.  One guard tried to shut Naomi back in the cage, in return for which he nearly got his windpipe crushed; in the face of Natasha insisting she wasn't kidnapped at all, and his crewman turning purple, the captain decided to take them both upstairs for a further discussion.<br/><br/>The two remaining guards tended to their gasping fellow, which gave the Cyrus, Snargle and Kale the distraction they needed.  Kale picked the lock with ease (I don't remember whether this required a roll or not) and then the three of us tackled the guards--Snargle's shape-shifting attack here is the source of John's "goblin headbag" reference on the One Cool Thing video.  We all rolled in our combat abilities (I remember using a lot of pool dice, since I hadn't unlocked "Brawl" yet) and did pretty well, although Kale didn't quite make his target and got Injured as a condition.<br/><br/>Cut to the not-quite-an-interrogation room, where Captain Hollas tried to get to the bottom of the Lady Blackbird's situation.  It was here that she discovered for the first time just who Cyrus Vance was, and though it clearly shocked her, she maintained that she was with them of her own free will.  But the captain had already made up his mind--the Hand of Sorrow was slowly coming about for the trip back to Ilysium, and he had two elite crewmen escort them to the plush guest quarters, where they were to stay until landfall.<br/><br/>Quick shot of the three guards in their underwear, morosely playing whist in their own cage, then back to Cyrus, Snargle and Kale hustling down the hallway in ill-fitting uniforms.  John conveniently had a cart full of engineers and explosives pass right by us, with one of them (the engineers, not the explosives) complaining "do we have to blow it up?  It's a good old ship!"<br/><br/>I ordered Kale and Snargle after them, one to keep the Owl from getting detonated, the other to sabotage the Hand of Sorrow so it couldn't give chase to us.  Cyrus himself, of course, went off to pick up our passengers--Key of Hidden Longing!  Meanwhile, Naomi had already snapped their guards' necks; Natasha was a bit horrified and ordered Naomi to at least try not to kill people next time, but it worked, since the three of us met up almost immediately.  We got some good banter in:<br/><br/>Natasha:  You didn't tell me you were a criminal!  Look at this wanted poster!<br/>Cyrus:  That's out of date!  The reward is higher now.<br/><br/>I sent them down to the ship and continued onward to sabotage the ship's Dragonfly fighters.<br/><br/>Kale and Snargle hopped right into the explosives cart and tried to pass themselves off as an escort; the two of them failing to bluff people in hilarious ways would become something of a theme in the game.  They failed that roll, so Kale magically enveloped the cart in darkness while Snargle shrunk down to break some knees.  That worked better!  Kale took the explosives and went off to the engine room while Snargle headed to the Owl.<br/><br/>Cyrus ran smack into Captain Hollas--pause, blink, quick-draw!  I made an easy interrogation roll, marched him onto the tactical deck, broke the lever for the fighter launch ramps and locked him inside.  Kale almost got away with his mission in the engine room, but got caught in an exciting chase sequence (fortunately planting the bomb first).  Snargle tried very casually to just waltz out, unchain and refuel the Owl, which worked nicely when Kale's alarm bells called the guards away from their posts.<br/><br/>We all rendezvoused down in the hangar--Kale was dangling from a ventilation duct a good fifty feet above--and the ship's marines were close behind us.<br/><br/>Natasha:  Have you seen the captain?<br/>Snargle:  Oh sure, he's about this tall and has brown hair...<br/><br/>I think we failed a few rolls to get away from them (I certainly did, and got Angry as a condition) until the Lady Blackbird knocked the whole rank out with a blast of chain lightning.<br/><br/>Cyrus:  ... I should stop making fun of her.<br/><br/>The Owl zipped away, the Hand of Sorrow turned to pursue, there was a bloom of light from their engine room and the whole ship began to list down into the Deep Blue.  We headed down there too, into the corrosive depths haunted by sky squid, and escaped into our interlude scenes.<br/><br/>It's been long enough that I can't remember who did what in these now.  I know Kale must have had a scene to refresh from Injured--was that with Natasha?  Cyrus had a scene with Naomi, during the night watch, in which it became clear that she'd noticed his feelings about Lady Blackbird and that he got very scowly and stammery when confronted about it.  (John kept laughing and putting tokens on my Key of Hidden Longing for some reason.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216303/#Comment_216303" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T19:00:29+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  7:00PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2009 7:03PM by Brendan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ACT TWO<br/><br/>We landed at Nightport, which John described as quite literally a hive of scum and villainy, with dozens of wasplike docking bays drilled into the back side of the asteroid.  The Lady Blackbird assumed a hooded disguise, and we led her into our usual point of contact, an upended ship-bar called the Silver Eel ("It used to be the Silver Keel," said John, "but the K fell off").<br/><br/>On the top floor, we sat down with proprietor Alice Keel--who was wearing a ring with Uriah Flint's crest!  What's more, a painting of her as a young woman hung on the back wall, embracing Uriah, who appeared to be the same age.  While Cyrus and Kale tried delicately to negotiate with Alice for the secret path through the Remnants to Uriah's lair, Natasha leapt in and demanded to know what the ring and the painting meant.  Alice, of course, wanted to know exactly who was asking.<br/><br/>After a few tense moments, Alice grinned and decided she liked Natasha's spirit.  She handed over the ring, which gave the wearer visions of the route to Uriah's home, and told the menacing-looking pirates scattered around the room that the plan was off.  Their captain (Tristan Cross?) grumped in disappointment and headed back to his ship, the biggest one in port, the infamous Iron... Something.  Sentinel?  Yet a few people who were obviously watching us stayed behind.<br/><br/>Despite Alice's concession, Natasha was a little shaken by all this new information and decided she needed a couple of days to think things over.  Cyrus, pouting about the fact that she still wanted to go through with it at all, demanded double his original fee to take her through the dangerous Remnants.  This gave John the opportunity to introduce Drunk Helpful Pirate, who volunteered to "do it for half," whatever "it" was.  Naomi cracked her knuckles, but Natasha and Kale persuaded him to go relieve himself on one of the watchers, for half of nothing.  The resulting brawl allowed us to exit without followers.<br/><br/>Even though I don't think there was a conflict roll in that scene--Lesley's character acting was good enough to get us out of it--we went to interludes, while Natasha turned things over and Cyrus went on a two-day bender.  There was some really good stuff in here!<br/><br/>Cyrus:  (drunk)  I have an idea.  For the ship.  We're not taking on any more passengers who pay with...  money.<br/>Snargle:  Then how are they gonna pay us, boss?<br/>Cyrus:  (intently)  <i>Friendship.</i><br/><br/>Snargle:  I know just how you feel.<br/>Cyrus:  Really?  Are there lady goblins?<br/>Snargle:  It's tough to tell.  You see, we can shape-shift, so--<br/>Cyrus:  I don't want to talk about this anymore.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Natasha talked out her problems with Naomi, which is to say Natasha talked while Naomi took long-suffering looks out the window.  During one such, she caught a glimpse of a line of scarred slaves much like herself being led down to the docks.<br/><br/>Christian:  I thought people were free out here?<br/>John:  Not from the pirates.<br/><br/>Naomi locked gazes with one of the slaves, and an acknowledgement passed between them; then he looked away, tacitly releasing her from the need to think about him.  But she couldn't stop, and she and Natasha had a really moving conversation about how Naomi would need to leave her Lady Blackbird behind when they got to Uriah--both because it would no longer be her place to protect her, and because she had to come back here and work to end the pirates' slavery.  I can't overstate how good Christian and Lesley were here.  This might have been the best scene in the game.<br/><br/>During all this, Kale was breaking into the <i>second</i>-biggest pirate ship, the Turtle, and grabbing a bunch of their loot--which he promptly stashed in the hold of the Iron Sentinel.  Then he rescued Snargle from Cyrus's rant/vomit/rant cycle and roped him into using his fast-talking skills to complete the scam.<br/><br/>They went back to the Silver Eel, wearing some of the flashier bits of the loot and talking loudly about how cheap they got it from the Sentinel's crew.  The Turtle crewmen noticed and became incensed; Matt and Lukas failed their first combined bluffing roll, but changed tacks and made it in the end, tricking them into mounting a raid on the Sentinel to get their stuff back without even telling their captain.<br/><br/>At some point in here we worked out that while Snargle had developed a crush on Naomi, Naomi was interested in Kale, who was completely oblivious to the whole thing.  It was a beautifully set-up triangle, and I wish we'd had a second or third episode to explore it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216304/#Comment_216304" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T19:00:38+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  7:00PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ACT THREE<br/><br/>Time was running short, so we montaged through the rough journey to Uriah's lair:  Natasha with her eyes glowing, hand on Snargle's shoulder to guide him; Cyrus being extremely sensitive to bright lights and loud noises; sky squid smashing their tentacles through the portholes and the crew hacking desperately at them; strange celestial phenomena and creatures like none of us had ever seen.  At last, battered and limping, we passed through the veil at the very edge of the Wild Blue and found ourselves for the first time in a dark sky, lit by an eternal moon instead of an eternal sun.<br/><br/>We landed on Uriah's lush, green planetoid, and he was waiting in the door of his manor, smiling and silhouetted ambiguously.  Cyrus and Natasha got in one last Han-Leia/Mal-Inara squabble, with him demanding three times the fee for his trouble, and she tossing him four--probably enough, John pointed out, to buy the Owl and its crew.  We shut the ramp and struggled to lift off, with the crew urging a stone-faced Cyrus not to leave her behind.  But leave her we did, with an Owl that probably didn't have enough fuel or supplies to get home again.<br/><br/>Natasha hesitantly approached Uriah, with questions about exactly how many wives he'd had and why he didn't seem to age.  "Nothing grows old here, nor will you," he said.  "I'm glad you've come!  The others will be so glad to see you when they arrive."  Ominous smile!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Owl pierced the veil of the Blue again...  only to discover the Turtle and the Sentinel, waiting patiently for them just on the other side.<br/><br/>CREDITS!<br/><br/>I wish I'd made myself write this up sooner; I'm doing it mostly to help myself remember details.  Both years I've attended GPNW, I've had one session that tops everything else, that combines of a new and fascinating system with the perfect group of players to demonstrate the full potential of what we can do.  This was my game of the year.

They keys worked amazingly well.  Lukas kept cracking me up.  Brendan's hidden love led to lots of awkward (meaning cool) moments.  Lesley was great as Naomi's Lady, especially in that scene Brendan mentioned, where she was torn between following her own heart and helping Naomi follow hers. Matt's Kale was so well done roguish and ingenious (with the ploy to blame the mercenaries for stealing the other pirates' Treasue) that Naomi couldn't help but develop a crush on him. And, of course, John threw us in lots of situations that allowed us to play our characters to the hilt.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216325/#Comment_216325" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T23:29:19+00:00" title="July  3, 2009 11:29PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I so want to play this with a full compliment!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216406/#Comment_216406" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T13:44:48+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  1:44PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game was such a blast.
