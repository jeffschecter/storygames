                    Posted this in the CN thread, then realized almost nobody reading that thread isn't already going. So, we've had a couple of emergency drop-outs, two of which had already paid, and so now there's empty bunks. Neither of them have asked for a refund of any money, which is very cool of them, but it'd be nice if they could recoup some of that expense. So if you'd like to come, here's what you do:<br/><br/>1) Post here. <br/>2) Make a deal with Clinton to buy his slot, or with Remi to buy Liz's slot, and pay them something. If both those slots get re-bought, I'll open up the third slot at the normal $65 rate.<br/>3) They or their minions will let me know if that has occurred, and you'll be cleared to come.<br/><br/>Hope you can make it!<br/><br/>Dave                </div>

                            I've posted links to the DCRPG mailing list that I run.  There's a few score people subscribed, we might be able to fill those slots.                        </div>
