No. 1 and read the article on Solo Dungeon Adventures. One of the suggestions in the first paragraph is to have some outside your group mail you special rooms, traps/tricks, monsters, treasure, etc... Has anyone tired this method, either running solo or with a group?<br/><br/>I was kind of imagining a gaming group waiting to see what random things were mailed to them to fill in the dungeon map and story.<br/><br/>I'd imagine you'd have to make things somewhat relevant by using suggestions put forth by Eero <br/><a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/challenge-based-adventuring/" rel="nofollow">Challenge Based Adventuring</a><br/>and<br/><a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/bull-dungeoneering/" rel="nofollow">Bull Dungeoneering</a><br/><br/><br/>Ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186048/#Comment_186048" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T11:10:03+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 11:10AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is kind of a neat idea.

Potentially more fun that way.<br/><br/>I'd also lean towards writing non-mechanical challenges, but that's just because of my recent theories about how rules-systems in this sort of games are intended to capture fictional challenges, not to give rise to system-based ones. If a given adventure based on the same genre (dungeon delving, sword &amp; sorcery, chivalry, whatever) somehow becomes trivial because you switch rules-systems, then there's something wrong with the rules-set that refuses to recognize the right things as potential challenges. In reality I imagine that this'd be exactly the case, of course, but I find it a shame when system-based "challenges" are so pale and fictionally strained as they have to be.<br/><br/>It might be simple enough to just write a challenge and post it here for others to play through once a system was agreed-upon. I'd probably vote for a non-dungeon environment simply because all of my interesting ideas for challenges seem to not involve square rooms and unlikely traps. But that's my personal limitations talking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186221/#Comment_186221" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T08:04:53+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  8:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            a rules system that allows you to be creative in how you approach the problem is a definite must.

You can sort of see how this is not the case in places in modern D&amp;D, for example - the challenge in fighting a dragon in 3rd edition D&amp;D is often not anything one would recognize from dragon-slaying fiction, but simply the numerical problem of overcoming the magic resistance of the dragon, perhaps by questing for suitable magic items. The dragon-slaying act itself is a matter of casting powerful magics to incapacitate the beast instead of doing the right tactical things in the actual situation. Usually the dragon-slaying is not much of a challenge by itself even, as the dragon attack without warning anyway and the adventure structure certainly does not encourage preparing for the encounter with elaborate strategy or tactics. It's not so much about slaying the dragon but about wielding the powerful magics that will kill anything, including a dragon.<br/><br/>In comparison, I often use the simile of dragon-slaying to explain what I find interesting in gamist adventure games: I want a game that allows me to take the what-if of dragonslaying and tackle it - the less means the game has to validate my natural, system-independent ideas for how to go about the dragon-slaying, the less meaning it has for me as an experience at dragon-slaying. How might a mere man wielding steel and courage overcome such a beast, that is the question the player should get to answer with flair. This is a bit of a problem if my original reason for not playing Chess and playing D&amp;D was that I wanted to tackle the imaginary challenge of dragon-slaying. I sort of see D&amp;D rules mechanics as actively working against this basic goal of mine when utilized by the book; whenever I play D&amp;D as ran by anybody else, it seems that any clever tactics or strategy that tries to frame a challenge in new terms is met with the relentless initiative rolls and mindless orcs who come and kill my character, roundly ignoring all misdirection, negotiation, maneuvers for time and space and everything else one might think up when looking at the actual challenge in purely fictional terms. I know what is going on here in theory (it's gambling-based quick reward cycles in action), but I just don't find that interesting enough.<br/><br/>It might be illustrative for understanding where I'm coming from with this if I say that some of the best gamist design and play I've seen has been simple forum speculation - you know those threads at the RPG.net and other places where somebody asks something like "would a 20th level wizard be able to conquer our world" or "what would you do if you had super powers", and then everybody starts speculating about how such a magic-user might go about accomplishing the goal. Those threads are often full of practical considerations, strategy and tactics, counter-tactics and logistical issues that are simply lacking from the way roleplaying adventures are written.<br/><br/>But that's all theory, and probably not very pertinent to this practical exercise. I simply meant to say that when I hear "write a challenge", my first instinct is to write something that would be a challenge in reality, and then see how a given rules-system deals with this fiction. Like the <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/fury-of-nifur/" rel="nofollow">Fury of Nifur</a>, which was my first, essentially improvised stab at creating a gamist adventure I'd be interested in - the "challenge" in that scenario is not mechanical, indeed there are no mechanics; instead, the challenge is a set of powers and goals in motion that provide an interesting strategic and tactical field without adding any game mechanics to the mix. When one chooses a rules-set to run the adventure in, that choice will obviously remove some challenges from consideration while making others more prominent, but in theory the actual situation itself is ripe with challenge even without adding the preconceived framework of a given rules-set.<br/><br/>Regarding the practical exercise, yeah, I guess one might use Storming the Wizard's Tower - it seems like an interesting game, to be sure, even if I haven't explored it enough to tell whether I'd know how to write interesting challenges for it. Perhaps I should look into that part of the game, I've only read the character creation rules so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186245/#Comment_186245" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T10:08:43+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 10:08AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>  Thanks for your thoughts there. Between your blog posts about Fury of Nifur and many indie games that have brought me back into rpging. So I am curious about how do we do this challenge based exercise and still retain some elements of randomness as suggested in the Strategic Review article? It's possible that the two can't co-exist.  <br/>  In other words can we have interesting challenges for solo play (along the lines of Fury of Nifur) and retain some dungeon goodness in a way that satisfies what we all find fun. <br/><br/>Maybe we can all read through StWT and then come back here with some ideas. Are there other possible rule sets? <br/><br/>Ara<br/><br/>Another thought: The original article I read had you going through some random bits and then other people contributed challenges for you to face. Is that possible with your idea of fun and challenges? I agree we also need to get at the what-if of dragon slaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186291/#Comment_186291" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T12:06:42+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 12:06PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like StWT, although now I suddenly have another thought...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>It might be illustrative for understanding where I'm coming from with this if I say that some of the best gamist design and play I've seen has been simple forum speculation - you know those threads at the RPG.net and other places where somebody asks something like "would a 20th level wizard be able to conquer our world" or "what would you do if you had super powers", and then everybody starts speculating about how such a magic-user might go about accomplishing the goal.

Are you familiar with them? I believe they were dreamed up to facilitate just this kind of open-ended tactical play. I think of them as being sort of like tactical thought experiments. In a Matrix Game, you start by setting up the field of play (the so-called matrix), which includes the situation and available facts. This can include tactical constraints, like the capabilities of weapons, or limitations of terrain. Players then make a series of argument regarding what they think will happen next. The arguments are rated according to how likely they seem, then resolved with a dice-rolling contest. Each player champions a certain actor in the situation. You win the game if your actor succeeds at their goals (which gives you a reason to invent arguments that lead to their success).<br/><br/>To use Eero's dragon-slaying example: the starting set up is a Dragon's lair, defined by the game master. You can stat up the dragon in some game system, which gives you a general overview of its capabilities. The player stats up a character in the same system. This gives us a situation to play out. The stats give us a basis of comparison (i.e. the Dragon is much stronger, the hero can cast fireball).<br/><br/>I think matrix games have a huge potential for tactical play. They are also suited to quick, over-the-net style play. Would you be interested in trying something like this out with me?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186296/#Comment_186296" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T12:23:27+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 12:23PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2009 12:24PM by akooser.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am game for the matrix style of play.

I simply meant to say that when I hear "write a challenge", my first instinct is to write something that would be a challenge in reality, and then see how a given rules-system deals with this fiction. Like the<a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/fury-of-nifur/" rel="nofollow">Fury of Nifur</a>, which was my first, essentially improvised stab at creating a gamist adventure I'd be interested in - the "challenge" in that scenario is not mechanical, indeed there are no mechanics; instead, the challenge is a set of powers and goals in motion that provide an interesting strategic and tactical field without adding any game mechanics to the mix. When one chooses a rules-set to run the adventure in, that choice will obviously remove some challenges from consideration while making others more prominent, but in theory the actual situation itself is ripe with challenge even without adding the preconceived framework of a given rules-set.<br/></blockquote>\nThis got me thinking about what systems would not be useful for this kind of challenge. These definitions are from Ben Lehman's Intro to Forge Theory and Vincent's How RPG Rules Work. <br/><br/>"A rule is a method through which we effect out play"<br/>"The system is the means by which the players manipulate the shared imagined space"<br/><br/>So Eero, in the Fury of Nifur you breakdown the jobs of the players and the jobs of the GM. Are these rules? As defined above. The jobs as described in Fury of Nifur allow me to get at the fiction and manipulate, is that correct? <br/><br/>The retro-clones I have read and played make the kind of challenge in Fury of Nifur pretty impossible to execute without house ruling. So I am wondering if I try to tackle a random dungeon with challenges from other people using a retro-clone can I get at the in game fiction? <br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186418/#Comment_186418" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T18:26:56+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm unhappy with the term "rule" - Ben's definition is solid, but it's also so wide as to not really be useful when anybody wants to discuss rules against non-rules. I prefer the naturally intuitive notion that "rules" are these procedures players have to follow to not be accused of rules-breaking. This is an useful definition because it reveals a number of important vistas that are not rules in this sense, but are still followed regularly and certainly effect out play. For instance, method - good GMing practice is preferable to bad GMing practice, but we don't call it a "rule" that the GM should practice good method; it's part of the traditional GM's role that he has freedom to make stupid choices, and making only good choices has never been elevated into a rule in a traditional rpg.<br/><br/>With these quibbles, I'd say that what I wrote about in Fury of Nifur and the connected blog post about challengeful adventuring were not rules, but methods. They could be formalized into rules, but the way I wrote that stuff, I just wanted to describe some methods I chose to play a satisfactory fantasy adventure. The actual rules-system we used did not address these issues I described in length in those posts, and the rules recognized at the table had more to do with task resolution than GM/player duties.<br/><br/>On the other hand, while I might insist on calling the principles I outlined in the text "methods" instead of "rules", they are certainly all part of the System in theoretical terms.<br/><br/>As for your observation, I agree that the retro-clones (and the original games) are problematic from my viewpoint. I should write at some point about how we played a short session of red box D&amp;D (Mentzer) a couple of weeks ago and got prominently killed in the first encounter by a... cadaver worm? What's the English name, I forget. Anyway, we played the included adventure from the GM's guide and found out that not only was the adventure sort of boring, there wasn't much to be done in terms of smart play to vanquish the monster. Of course this gets to the wide issues of GMing method (the GM might have chosen to reward smart play more judiciously instead of following the rules to the letter) and player skill (my coplayer was, frankly, idiotic in attacking the creature head-on after I saved his keister with great personal risk in the first place), but reading the adventure text afterwards, it seemed obvious to me that it never came to the mind of the writer that the heroes might somehow fail to get over this completely overpowering obstacle. Perhaps we were just too stupid to survive it or something, but if there was some sort of tactical challenge to be had, I didn't perceive it either while playing or while reading the adventure text.<br/><br/>If I may be allowed to generalize in one paragraph, my general issue with old D&amp;D and games of its ilk tends to be that the rules and practice of those games focus heavily on simple gambling and risk-taking as the main solutions to anything and everything. Of course anybody can claim that a good GM will run it differently, but it'd be disingenuous to claim that the rules are intended to be run with any major component of strategy or tactics. You're supposed to wait for the GM to announce a combat encounter, roll initiative and hope you'll hit with the attack rolls. This is the prominent activity in the game, and the most emphasized tactical option you have is to run away if the situation starts seeming bad. Strategy only comes up as a very high-order thing that concerns resource management and perhaps, if the dungeon is particularly adroit, choosing whether to provoke a given combat or not. The GM is supposed to think up excuses for why players can't use certain high-order un-heroic tactics, such as calling in the king's men, to clear the dungeons.<br/><br/>Looking at the above characterization of the rules, which is in harmony with my experiences, I constantly run into grave trouble with that game when I try to play it. My mind doesn't seem to work on those terms: I insist on choosing myself whether to fight (as opposed to having the GM announce a combat, expecting me to jump at it), I try to understand the strategic goals of the opponent (usually just murderous rage and/or an intent to murder and rob), I try to rig battles to my favour by being aware of the battleground and the enemy (actively punished by requiring all sorts of ability checks that have horrid consequences on failure) and so on and so forth; the very system of the game conspires to both make combat the major challenge in the game and enforce an essentially random and generic round-by-round structure in this main endeavour of the game. I'm not surprised at all if GMs running these games as written encounter a lot of players with an essentially passive approach to combat - hitting the closest enemy is certainly the only combat option really supported by the rules system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186419/#Comment_186419" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T18:27:13+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The above was a bit long, but it's necessary to answer the last bit: I think that you can use one of these games to engage with fictional challenges (as opposed to the challenge of rolling a high number with a 20-sided die), as long as those challenges are the sort of fictional challenges these games offer. Specifically, I think that D&amp;D in all its editions does a fine job of offering you this challenge: when your character is injured from an earlier fight and has limited information about what is ahead of him in the dungeon, should he push on or go back? In what conditions will he push on? What unknown opportunity costs does not pushing on incur? The rules of the game make almost all preparation for combat absolutely useless (by GM fiat if nothing else - the rules in most versions of D&amp;D are clear in that you're not supposed to allow the players to routinely get around the fights by smart play), except for the exception that lost hit points and spells can very well be recovered by the "preparation" of going to rest! This single rule makes for the deepest strategic choice in the game, it seems to me, and thus also the most natural launch point for a series of fictional challenges: if the princess will be killed in three days (= three rests from D&amp;D rules perspective), then how will we manage our limited resources vis-a-vis incoming fights?<br/><br/>It is notable that the only fictional challenges D&amp;D is good with seem to be the fictional challenges familiar to us from dungeoneering fiction. This is not surprising when we remember that D&amp;D pretty much single-handedly created this peculiar genre of fiction that is quite different from other fantasy. The art and flavour texts of red box D&amp;D try heroically to hide this, but in truth D&amp;D is in no way a game of heroic fantasy or sword &amp; sorcery - it's dungeoneering fantasy through and through, and consequently the challenges it's good at are those of dungeoneering fantasy. If those challenges seem disinteresting (like they do to me), then that might be because you haven't had enough D&amp;D in your upbringing. Me, I started roleplaying with Runequest, MERP and other such games - it's obvious that I approach dungeoneering fantasy, which I never practiced in my youth, as an aberration in the whole fantasy adventure genre of roleplaying. You can see how Fury of Nifur displays this preference: it doesn't have one trap laid out by kobolds or insane magicians for the characters to disarm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186440/#Comment_186440" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T23:47:59+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 11:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems we've wandered a bit from the topic, but productively so.<br/><br/>Our group played a great deal of Red Box (Moldvay) D&amp;D last year, seeking what wisdom might lie at the bottom of it. Our conclusions were a bit different from yours. <br/><br/>We attempted to play the game as written. Dungeons are incredibly deadly to PCs under third level. We quickly established that in order to survive fights you must continually innovate on your tactics and approach. Moldvay does provide some rules for making ability rolls (pretty rudimentary), so we used those. There is a useful lesson here--innovate or die. By contrast, when I played D&amp;D 3.0, I faced only encounters whose difficulty was balanced to my character. I had no reason to engage the game in any way other than swinging my sword at the monster. Indeed, if I did anything else, I was failing in my job as damage dealer and seriously disadvantaging the party. Boring!<br/><br/>Our game featured many exciting moments of adventure. The fact that a misstep meant a high probability of dead characters added some real teeth to every encounter. We were shouting heated negotiations at orcs through a door they had barred against us. Ben held off a wolf pack with flaming oil. A wizard engaged in a desperate chase with a wererat.\n<blockquote>supposed to wait for the GM to announce a combat encounter, roll initiative and hope you'll hit with the attack rolls. This is the prominent activity in the game, and the most emphasized tactical option you have is to run away if the situation starts seeming bad. </blockquote>\nThis stood out to me in your post. This would be a game killer for our style of play. Struggling to make choices about when and where to fight is pretty important. If GM fiat is the only thing that decides when there's a fight, then I agree, running and resting are the only real tactical choices. It takes the positioning entirely out of the game. I think there is a serious dysfunction here in a lot of dungeoneering games. They act as though the encounter is an unambiguous element. When in fact there needs to be a great deal of positioning around the combat: when and where does it happen? Is it a fight or a negotiation? Is there a chance to avoid it? Who gets the jump on whom?<br/><br/>I think that pre combat positioning is implicit in the idea that the GM acts as the eyes and ears of the players. This goes right up until the point that someone tries to sink their sword or teeth into an opponent. The rules are fundamentally silent on the topic, yet it's in the interplay between encountering a monster and rolling for initiative that we found the most fruitful area for play.<br/><br/>It's very late now, and I must to bed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186452/#Comment_186452" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T01:55:09+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  1:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I certainly agree with you about how the game should be run to make any sense to it. Of course I could slag at my co-players (GM included), but I think the text of the game has something to answer for as well. Unless Jari, Sami etc. guys around here are just totally jerking me on and actually just were taking a piss when making their player and GM decisions, then at least for our group the honest collective interpretation of the text led us to concluding that anything but dying from that carrion crawler (now I remember the name of the monster) would require major workarounds to the rules and expected style of play - so major in fact that calling the to-hit procedures "combat rules" would be ridiculous if 90% of your success were to be predicated on avoiding those procedures.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes, you'll note above that I think it quite possible that the guys were, in fact, jerking me around and not engaging with the game seriously at all. This hasn't been the only time I've played an old roleplaying game with established roleplayers, and the general attitude at these exercises tends to run towards humorous and/or simply vindictive, like the players had something to prove about how the game doesn't work. It wouldn't surprise me greatly if Sami, say, were to read this and confess to me that he, in fact, was intentionally making stupid decisions out of some mistaken impression that he was supposed to "roleplay" or some such - and as a result then got the team killed early. I have no idea, really, for while it seems to me that attacking enemies directly is almost certain death for 1st level characters, not fighting also seems horribly against the spirit of the rules. All examples of play essentially presume that when the GM gives you a monster, the first instinct is to fight it or die.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn truth one would need to play red box D&amp;D; or other such complex game for several sessions to get any sense for how it's "supposed" to work, and even then I suspect that it wouldn't necessarily be worth it for these people at this juncture. It's so much easier to just write your own game to make combats and whatnot into the sort of challenges you yourself expect them to be instead of staying at the mercy of the capricious D&amp;D; paradigm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186824/#Comment_186824" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T09:59:51+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  9:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a neat conversation.

In GURPS, however, they would get quickly swarmed. And that dragon at the end?

"Trust" here means that the group in general believes in the social truth of the notion that the GM actually, really does not have any vested interest in being unobjective. "Open determination" is simply that everybody knows what the rules are and how they should be refereed, so if the GM starts doing bullshit, it's readily apparent. When the GM says that something has a difficulty of, say, 30, the players are easily in position to ask why this simple deed should have such a high difficulty rating.<br/><br/>Ah, there's actually a third thing, the shared creative agenda: because we only care about challenge situations, when the GM rules in a way that doesn't make a given situation into a challenge, he is essentially saying "not yet". We are not making this thing a challenge, see how I rule it to be trivially simple. This is not undermining the core of play simply because any situations that are resolved by simple GM ruling were, in retrospect, only segues in-between the real core matter of play. So in a way the GM <b>can't</b> use force: either he rules in a manner that makes challenge emerge, or he is running a segue that only provides context for the challenge to come. (Should the GM constantly undermine challenge, he'd of course be an asshole.)<br/><br/>Significantly, <i>any</i> player can make a situation into a "not yet" segue simply by showing how it is trivial. Remember - we're only interested in the interesting situations, the sort that make people on the forums speculate about potential solutions. "How will we find the vampire who haunts this village?" or "How do we assassinate the president without getting caught?" or "how do we get through this underwater tunnel" or the like. So whenever a given situation emerges, we'll only find out whether it's a core challenge environment from how the GM and the players judge it. If anybody can just open his mouth and provide a trivial solution, then it wasn't an interesting challenge, but just a segue. There is no difference between an "easy challenge" and a segue - play flows flexibly through both.<br/><br/>Even further, a situation that is "too hard" is likewise not interesting for us as a core experience, it's just another way for the GM to say "not yet". There is no agenda problem in the GM dictating that this combat will be lost - it's simply a segue into the really interesting prisoner's dilemma he's setting up. Not that I myself do that sort of thing, mind, but in theory there is no problem - whenever the GM is not refereeing fairly, there cannot be a challenge, and therefore we're just running a segue. Of course the GM is going to suck if he doesn't realize himself what he is doing (postponing challenge situations), but that's a sucky GM and not a problem with the system.<br/><br/>As an example of this all, one of the entrances into my dungeon is underwater. I've characterized it as "the sort of underwater tunnel Conan swims through heroically from time to time, gasping for breath on the other side". Most of the player characters are far from Conan, so one would think that this is a challenge situation, and it was sort of like that. It was obvious that a character might get into mortal danger by going into an unknown underwater tunnel without preparation. What the players decided to do was to build a sort of primitive diving bell thingy by using an upended boat, weights, muscle and patience. After the players described this solution, did I resort to GM force to determine whether it would work? I did nod along, suggest potential improvements and give terms - the set-up was practical, but it would still require certain mediocre ability checks to make it work. Thus the challenge was resolved in one manner, a manner that put plenty of further constraint on the characters later on - their solution was slightly risky (one might manage to overturn the diving bell while in the pitch black underwater tunnel, getting drowned), had limited capasity for moving materials inside, and made practically everything they cared to take to the dungeon quite wet.<br/><br/>The reason for why I don't consider the above interaction GM force is that I had quite limited freedom in making my call. I could have decided that the diving bell solution is not practical, but then I would have had to demonstrate how so - and if it were just a matter of "it's difficult to operate" or some such, then I'd have been obliged to set an ability check, which I in fact did. And if my check difficulty were really high, to represent how I found the diving bell solution unlikely, that's not force, it's negotiation - the players could abandon the diving bell solution at that point and try something more practical, or they could decide to take the risk with the difficult solution if they believed in their ability scores.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188327/#Comment_188327" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T14:21:55+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  2:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One might at this point note that I'm discussing "force", not fiat. This is because fiat is not a very interesting issue - of course I use GM fiat whenever I use any powers assigned by the system to the GM. The term is more useful when we consider total systems and compare systems with few GM powers with those that have many. Here I imagine that we're not interested in when the GM makes decisions, but when he makes wrong ones - that's why I use the Forge term Force: GM fiat turns into force only when the GM obviates agenda-meaningful choices the players expect they should be making. In this particular method of play individual task difficulties are set by the GM to represent his vision of the setting, but that's not a player choice he's obviating - it's a step in negotiation between the player and the GM about a series of tasks the player is willing to risk to get to his goal. Sometimes there is no solution and the player backs down. Sometimes the solution is obvious and the GM backs down. Sometimes the situation is agreed upon as risky, but worthwhile, at which point we roll the dice and see what happens. No force here as far as I can see, even when the GM is indeed making decisions without recourse, just like the players are.<br/><br/>Oh, also: when I say that players "negotiate", that implies that they have some basis upon which to stand, some powers with which the GM has to make a compromise. This is in fact so: not only is the GM required to make factually correct decisions on matters concerning the fiction (he can't put difficulty rating 30 on something that is in fact easy to do in the setting, for example), but he also can't dictate character action, and he can't make things happen without fictional reason and consequence. Nothing in this list would prevent an actively subversive GM from lying, cheating and misleading his way to whatever solutions he wanted, but in a group that repudiates the golden rule and other such corruption of the social environment this is no more a problem than players who cheat at dice are. So in practice the players have plenty of negitiation power - the simplest example is when the player simply refuses to roll the dice on a bad deal the GM is offering. The GM offers "roll against 35 to lie successfully to the merchant prince", but the player doesn't have to take him up on this offer; he can negotiate some other course of action or even try to argue for a lower difficulty, assuming the GM might have made a mistake.<br/><br/>(Gah, this character limit on posts is just insane...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188328/#Comment_188328" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T14:22:07+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  2:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Setting fiat</b><br/><br/>Setting fiat is a much simpler issue (still from the viewpoint of misused force). In my recent play the GM has had complete control of the setting as well, so what prevents him from bringing in "more monsters" or the cavalry whenever he wants? The way I understand it, the limit here is considerably more vague, but it still exists. The key is to understand the challenge-based creative agenda: if the agenda is genuinely concerned with the challenge, then any on-the-fly situation modification is completely pointless. Consider: if you're going to save the heroes from death by throwing in Elminster, is it not the case that they still failed in the challenge? If we're genuinely playing for the challenge, then it should not matter to us what the failure outcome is as long as it serves our desire to play more and string challenges into more complex structures. When the GM makes the call as to whether all the characters should die or whether Elminster should come by to save them <i>is not deciding whether the characters succeed in the challenge</i>: the failure is just as obvious whether the characters die or get saved - the actual consequence is a relatively meaningless segue that is used to provide the next situation for the game.<br/><br/>The concept of segue is really important here, as the players can call bullshit on stupid events. Drop a rock and kill everybody, does that make you the big man GM? No, it's not a challenge the players explicitly accepted and invested in, so it's just a segue scene. That's why there is no such thing as a surprise challenge, really - the very least you have to do as a GM is to provide ample hints that <i>something</i> is going to challenge the player soon. Should the player recognize your warning and undertaketake (or not) any preparations he finds necessary, <i>then</i> you can drop the challenge on him. Nobody ever makes war game scenarios about an army attacking unarmed, pacifist civilians who refuse to fight - why? Should be obvious.<br/><br/>Viewed like this, setting fiat likewise disappears as long as the players and the GM are on the same page concerning the agenda, the challenge: problems only appear when the GM bullshits to make a success appear as failure or failure appear as success or a segue appear like a challenge or a challenge appear as a segue or a consequence disappear. (Quite a list, but those are all things you might do wrong when misusing setting fiat.) This is typical force GMing, you're trying to simulate a feeling of success or whatever by making the other players think that they won something when you really just railroaded them through it. But avoiding those sorts of misplay, almost anything goes. For example, last time we played, I decided that there is an extremely dangerous demon trapped inside the huge stone door to my dungeon. There were ample signs - so ample in fact that the players knew pretty well what they'd be facing with the demon, even if its eventual size and ferocity was a couple of magnitudes greater than they thought. This was a huge bit of GM setting-determination power, but was it force? I find this not to be the case, as the decision to make the setting be this way instead of that touched not upon the choices the other players got to make. Again, force only happens when I trample on the assigned rights and responsibilities of others. Interestingly, the reason that the demon was construed as challenge by us was that I made it clear in advance that there was in fact a demon there - had I not done this, the sudden demon attack would have been a segue, or a different sort of challenge. The difference between "let's see whether you can get past a demon" and "let's see if you can survive a sudden demon attack" is quite substantial, and the conditions in which they can each be put into play are different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
