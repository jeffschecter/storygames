Many thanks, participants, these are great.  I think that's enough to go on.  Here are the paragraphs, numbered for ease of reference:\n<blockquote>1. We passed by the smoldering remains of the fair on the way to school. The fire had started when the rusty Ferris wheel collapsed, due to a missing bolt or something, and crushed the concession stand. The mangled form of the Ferris wheel was now being hoisted off of the bodies by an aged crane, operated by a one-armed man who worked for the same company as my father. The stench was bearable, he'd later tell him, but the flies were not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. The fire monger knew this would be his only chance. Normally, he would be relegated to a remote, dark corner of the circus grounds by this time of night, but on this day his handler became inebriated imprudently early in the evening and had neglected the task. The fair maiden of his dreams - the dragonfly-winged object of his desire - had just left the tent followed by the cheer of her countless admirers. As she would pass him, he would meekly compliment her graceful, lithe form, and she would crane her neck to peer between the scorched bars of his cage and have pity upon him. He knew this would be his only chance. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. The Fire Crane took form in the air in front of me as I pronounced one final syllable in the forbidden tongue of the Fair People. It flapped its wings, once, twice, then shot off in the direction of Ylem, passing through the wall of my tower like a ghost. Tonight, the Queen of the Dusk would birth an heir. An heir with red hair and a soul of fire. The great game had begun. The world might not be entirely doomed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. The engines fired and the rocketship lifted into the air. Below me I saw London, shrinking as we flew. I focussed on the familiar and strange: there was the crane that hung over the Place; there was a fair, the Ferris wheel seemingly static. As we passed above the clouds, I looked down for the last time. Before, the view had been solid and tangible; now, covered in cloud, it was dreamlike, without form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. They walked down the midway at the county fair, a row of stands forming a temporary boulevard of gaudy concessions, neon-lit in the dark of evening. They passed the balloon race and the ring toss, the beanbag throw and the shooting gallery and the wheel of fortune. "Are we close?" asked the little boy with the face scarred by fire. "Is it here?" His father replied, "It's right there," and gestured toward a booth a little away from all the others, decorated with folded paper cranes that flew on fishing lines. He held his son's hand tightly, and they went together to the fortune teller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>6. There's a form of flight where the magician will change her shape to that of a bird - a crane, a magpie, a swan - and take off into the air. The magician's inner organs, her flesh, her heart, compress and contort to fit inside the new shape; her weight remains the same. To end the spell, she must pass her entire body through a fire. Any part that isn't touched by the flame will forever remain in bird form, while staying in the fire too long can be deadly; this is a dangerous magic, not something to be done for fun at the markets and fairs of common people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. I love the fair! Everybody's having so much fun, even daddy who really doesn't like anything fun. He won me a plush giraffe : steadied his gun, aimed at the little duck, and... FIRE! Hahahaha! People are forming a crowd in front of the next attraction, but I'm so short and cute they let me pass, no question. The man at the middle is performing magic tricks, building origami cranes and then magically making them fly, all the way to my nose! This is the best day ever!</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. We stood up and formed a line as the cargo plane passed over the drop zone. I craned my neck to see out the open door, but there was only smoke. Then a tap on my leg and I shuffled backward and out. The plane was flying low - 600 feet - and my chute opened with a snap. Below me I could see the fire, a bright line that described an arc across the valley I was about to land in fair and square.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226881/#Comment_226881" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T05:56:26+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  5:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw man, cross-post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226882/#Comment_226882" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T05:58:42+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  5:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No worries.
