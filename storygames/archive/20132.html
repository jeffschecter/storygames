I've never played Mythender, but I have the game and as I understand that involves rolling obscene amount of dice supposedly to invoke a sensory feeling of power from the weight of the dice and the sound when they hit the table. Interesting idea. My system is just rolling a lot of dice because it is practically necessary. Well, a lot of dice as far as I'm concerned, not Mythender amounts of dice.<br/><br/>It's 10D6 every roll. The system necessitates the dice being D6s and I wanted an extremely high chance of success. I've had some comments about it being too many dice and I normally am quick to listen to player feedback, but in this case the dice are kind of integral. <br/><br/>What is your experience with lots of dice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444648/#Comment_444648" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T11:38:24+00:00" title="April  8, 2015 11:38AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played Mythender, but I don't mind rolling a lot of dice.

Essentially, you choose one of the dice you rolled. If it's a 6, you succeed. But your 10D6 are divided between three sets of differentiated D6s which are modified separately. If the 6 you choose is one of a certain type, there is a complication to your success, if the 6 you choose is of another type, you succeed dramatically. The third, it's just a normal success.<br/><br/>EDIT: To clarify, most of the time you're rolling 3 D6s, 4 D6+1s and 3 D6-1s. You are looking for a single 6 on any one of these dice. If your 6 is on a D6, you succeed. If your 6 is on a D6+1, you succeed with a complication. If your 6 is on a D6-1, you succeed dramatically.<br/><br/>Apart from that it depends on what you're attempting for further details, for example when making an action in combat, for every 1 the result of your chosen die is above 6, you either graduate your deadly damage, or inflict some deadly damage even if you weren't trying to kill your target. Deadly damage isn't the game term, but you get what I mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444656/#Comment_444656" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T14:31:02+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  2:31PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In these situations, you generally have to weigh a few factors.<br/><br/>1.

Each result can represent a different stake, for example. Two or more sides roll their dice and compare results.<br/><br/>Start adding fiddly mechanisms like "choose a number and reroll all the dice of that value" (reroll all the 2's), and you get some neat options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444668/#Comment_444668" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T17:46:43+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  5:46PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2015 6:26PM by catty_big.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It depends on what you achieve from rolling those.

The hippy mantra that 'every dice roll should mean something' I agree with completely. But there are two things we have to consider when building a dice pool, especially if it's a large one: the input data and the output data. Kinda paraphrasing from previous posts, by Rickard and others, the input is how you build the pool; thus, in a specific game you might add skill + attribute, then mods and bonuses for various things like special equipment and/or magical items, defence stats, night vision etc. etc. I don\u2019t know how hard it would be for various games that use large dice pools to reduce them (<i>Exalted</i> being another one, which I don\u2019t think has been mentioned so far), but it\u2019s certainly possible to define/refine how you<i> interpret</i> the roll, which is the output data.<br/><br/>I agree with Rickard in that the more data the greater the impact on the game. My problem with that is 1) the more impact on the game the less \u2018manageable\u2019 the game becomes, in terms of the GM and/or players trying to sort out exactly what happens to who and what, when, where and how as a result of the roll, and the extent of changes applied to the scenario and the gameworld, and 2) the time taken to analyse the roll, which for me is the biggest beef I have with tactical games in general. I don\u2019t expect all my games to be fast and furious all the time, but there are limits as to how much I can take of the ponderous process of dice roll analysis, which I\u2019m afraid to say I find stupendously boring.<br/><br/>Oh, and DitV? First class use of dice pools IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444670/#Comment_444670" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T18:10:24+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  6:10PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2015 6:11PM by BeePeeGee.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't like rolling lots of dice.

The simplest game design has NO dice, right?  (No?) Mythender has a giant handful. Both extremes are trying to accomplish something with their choices. <br/><br/>I don't mind handfuls of dice as long as you get more out of that roll than you would with a simple 2d6 or 1d20 roll. That is, if you just need a random number on some kind of linear or bell curve, don't do something complicated. However, if you need more than a random number, I'm game for more fiddly results, like in Dogs in the Vineyard, or My Life with Master, or ORE, etc.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444691/#Comment_444691" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T03:36:33+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  3:36AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found from experience that subtracting or even adding a result to a die roll always slows things down.

The chance of success on 3D6, while being the meaning of life (42%) is nowhere near high enough. The reason I went up from 7D6 (79%) to 10D6 (93%) was because I felt like failing 1 in 5 rolls was not achieving what I wanted with the roll. But I might go back to 7D6 in the end. <br/><br/>I definitely take your point about lacking the dice, that's one of my main concerns, especially considering the fact that you also need three sets of dice that can be differentiated from one another.

In order to get a success, you must be able to choose one of your rolled dice with a <i>result</i> of 6 or higher.<br/><br/>Red dice are D6+1. You can only succeed on a Red die if you can qualify your success logically in the narrative i.e. something bad happens as a result of it.<br/><br/>Blue dice are D6. Your success on a Blue die is unqualified.<br/><br/>Yellow dice are D6 -1. A D6-1 can never get a result of a 6. Its range is 0-5. You cannot  naturally succeed on a Yellow die, but in certain circumstances (by advancing your character) when you can change that D6-1 to a D6 or even a D6+1, your success is dramatic and broadly beneficial.<br/><br/>To clarify, their colour isn't relevant, just that the dice be differentiated. I have run games where we have played with three sets of similarly coloured but distinguishable dice, and run games where we have played with only 3 dice that we have rolled sequentially. The game plays much, <i>much</i> better when each player has their own set of 7-10 dice though. That's what it's designed for. The ability to pre-emptively roll your dice while knowing that is all the dice you need to roll, no matter what.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444723/#Comment_444723" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T20:27:10+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  8:27PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2015 8:27PM by Adam_Dray.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Red dice are D6+1.

(You haven't revealed this part.)<br/><br/>Would you get the same results if you said a success is a 4 or higher, and rolled:<br/><br/>1d10 (red die) + 1d6 (blue die) + 1d4 (yellow)?<br/><br/>...with the yellow requiring a roll of 4 as well as [whatever conditions you require in your rules].<br/><br/>Or another way: success happens on a 4 or lower.<br/><br/>Roll 1d6 (red die) + 1d10 (blue die) + 1d20 (yellow).<br/><br/>I think you could also simplify it by figuring out how often you want dramatic successes to happen, and working that in another way.<br/><br/>For example, your roll is now 1d6+1d10, with a 4 or lower giving you a success.<br/><br/>If your 1d6 succeeds, you have to qualify the success. If it's the d10, you don't.<br/><br/>Now:<br/><br/>Let's say you want your dramatic successes to happen when your yellow dice roll a 6 AND you [satisfy special secret criteria]. I'm not clear on whether there are three or four yellow dice (your total adds up to 10 dice somehow, so there must be four of some colour), but let's say it was four, which means that you get a 6 roughly 50% of the time (and this is independent of the other two coloured dice rolls). <br/><br/>Just pick some feature which happens 50% of the time (and is independent of the two dice succeeding or failing), and tie your dramatic success to that:<br/><br/>Whenever the d10 rolls an even number, if you [meet special criteria], you can have a dramatic success. Or, if it doesn't have to be independent, it can be a 6 or higher.<br/><br/>So, now, instead of having to make 10 dice in three different colours, and doing math or putting stickers on them, you have:<br/><br/><i>When you need to roll, pick up two dice, a d6 and a d10. You usually need to roll a 4 or lower to succeed. <br/><br/>The d6 is the Pyrrhic die: when you succeed with it, your successes are mitigated, painful, costly.<br/><br/>The d10 is your Destiny die: when you succeed with it, your successes are accomplished, and sometimes dramatic. On a 4 or lower, you get what you wanted. However, whenever it rolls a 6 or higher, you can also use it for a dramatic success, which only happens when you [do special thing/achieve special secret criteria].</i><br/><br/>I don't know enough about your system to know whether this captures all the features you want; it's just an example. But it certainly solves your "10 dice in three different colours" dilemma.<br/><br/>You could probably work out the odds with three d6s, too, one in a special colour. Now it's starting to look really simple:<br/><br/><i>Roll 3d6, one of them in a special colour. You need a 5 or a 6 for a success. If it's the coloured die, you get a full success. If it's one of the two ordinary dice, it's a qualified success.<br/><br/>You can also achieve a dramatic success any time you roll a double [and achieve criteria].</i><br/><br/>That's pretty slick, and easy to remember. <br/><br/>(Doubles on 3d6 are in that 40-50% range, which is what you have in your mechanic; it might be a good match.)<br/><br/><br/>Edit: If you want a 1/5 chance of failure, and dramatic successes are so rare so we can discount them, then you'd want to go with 4 dice: three regular dice, and one coloured die. This means you'd have failure 1/5 of the time, unqualified success 1/3 of the time, and mixed outcomes 7/15 of the time.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444731/#Comment_444731" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-10T05:55:20+00:00" title="April 10, 2015  5:55AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2015 5:56AM by BeePeeGee.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Paul_T points out, that's pretty much what I wanted to say:<br/><i>"I'd always look for a way to recreate the same odds and the same procedure in a simpler fashion.

In this game, you can only get that "natural 20" if you are skilled at the chosen task.<br/><br/>In this game every ability has three "advancements": Proficient, Learned and Experienced (this is very intuitive displayed on the character sheet, even if it sounds needlessly complicated in theory, hence I didn't mention it before). You begin by becoming Proficient, then you can become Learned or Experienced, then you can become Learned and Experienced. When you're Learned or Experienced in ability, all your dice when using that ability are modified by +1. When you're both Learned and Experienced in ability, all your dice when using that ability are modified by +2. Thereby, your Yellow dice can score a 6.<br/><br/>This is essentially what I want from my dice system. <br/><br/><b>Chance of success 80% or higher.<br/><br/>Chance of qualified success 70% or higher.<br/><br/>Dramatic success only possible while Learned and/or Experienced.<br/><br/>The ability to push your luck following a failure. </b><br/><br/>Thank you for your help <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> those ideas have given me a lot to think about.

That means that your chances of a full success (without taking into account the other dice!) are already 7/8, or about 87.5%... once you add in the odds of a dramatic success (almost 20%) and a qualified success, it goes through the roof.<br/><br/>This means that you're rolling a lot of dice and doing some potentially tricky math (you're adding and subtracting different numbers to different dice, and have to remember which colours are which - I have a pretty extensive collection of dice, but I don't have Red, Blue, and Yellow, and certainly not enough for a whole group of gamers, so I'll have to substitute other colours, introducing more complications), all just to see whether you have a regular success or a dramatic success.<br/><br/>However, your last two posts really explain what you're going for, which is awesome!<br/><br/>How would you feel about something like this (just for fun; I don't even know if I'm being helpful here!):<br/><br/>Three dice, in three colours (since you insist! - and nothing wrong with that), all d6s. <br/><br/>A 5 or 6 is a success; one die gives regular successes and the other two give qualified successes (perhaps in different ways, depending on colour, that would be interesting). One of the qualified success dice is "special", because it can also give you dramatic successes.<br/><br/>Then you can do one of: <br/><br/>1. Change the die size.<br/><br/>If you're Learned or Experienced, you roll d8s instead.<br/><br/>If you're both, you roll d10s instead.<br/><br/>A dramatic success occurs on an 8 or higher, on the "special" die. (You could have it happen on ANY die to make it very likely, or just the "partial success" dice, but for my tastes just one die is enough: it's 12.5% chance of a dramatic success for someone Experienced, and 30% for someone Learned and Experienced, which sounds plenty high to me. Otherwise dramatic successes don't mean much, you know?)<br/><br/>2. Keep them as d6s, all the time. No need for funky dice. Add +1 or +2, as you have it now.<br/><br/>A dramatic success happens on a 7 or higher on the "special" die (yellow or whatever). This means a chance of ~16.7% of a dramatic success for an Experienced character, and ~33.3% for someone Learned and Experienced.<br/><br/><br/><i>[Edit: I just realized that this doesn't meet your criteria for "80% chance of success or higher". Although that seems really high for people who are totally unskilled. Won't most rolls happen with Learned or Experienced characters? In most games, that's how it works. But maybe your game is about inexperienced children doing stuff they don't know how to do? Then the high success percentage is puzzling, though...<br/><br/>Anyway, if you want 80%+, you'd have to use 4 dice, not 3. That ruins the elegance of the three colours a bit, so if you're really really attached to the whole 80% thing, you'll have to deal with rolling 4 dice. Make it one full success die, and three partial success dice, of which one is a Dramatic die. I'd go with the 70% chance you get with three dice, myself - plenty high, seems to me - but four dice would fly too.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444775/#Comment_444775" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T08:50:50+00:00" title="April 13, 2015  8:50AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again Paul_T; to explain why I want the 80%. Like GUMSHOE, this system is preoccupied with ensuring the success of its players and the progression of the narrative. In a sense, it assumes that the players have "plot armour"; that they don't just <i>fail</i>, because they are the protagonists. However, things do <i>go wrong</i> for the protagonists, frequently. Additionally, protagonists die. There aren't "dodge" rolls for the PCs to ace in this game. If you hit and you pick a Red, you are going to get hurt, there's no way around it.<br/><br/>There are ways to decrease the chances of success should the players attempt things far beyond their capabilities. In the current system that is ignoring colours of dice (first Yellow, then Blue thereby ensuring that if they succeed something will go wrong, and the more difficult the thing they are attempting, the harsher the consequences, of course). But I have so far never needed to go as far as cutting the Blues because the players are careful not to push themselves due to their characters being fragile.<br/><br/>Don't take the definitions of the terms so literally, in this game proficient does not mean "totally unskilled", it indicates your character is an expert in that field. Learned or Experienced means that due to their education or experience they have a special insight or talent for the subject beyond that of their peers. At the end of initial character creation, no character is Learned or Experienced in anything, because character creation sort of extends into play, but at the end of the first or second session, I'd say each character is probably Learned or Experienced in 1 or 2 proficiencies. <br/><br/>They can at most have 8, but most choose to branch out rather than specialise. When they do specialise, it's usually (and logically) in the proficiencies you are most likely to roll on, so I'm trying to come up with ways to further incentivise those you aren't going to roll on, but that's another matter entirely.<br/><br/>Getting back on topic...it's funny you should say 4 dice, that completely adds up with what I've been doing so far. You start with one of each, then during character creation you choose 1 extra of one of the dice.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444786/#Comment_444786" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T17:07:28+00:00" title="April 13, 2015  5:07PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, all that makes sense.<br/><br/>However, it might also make sense to stick with the three dice, and add in some other factor which allows people to increase their odds.

(Hello, diversity, physical dis/ability, gender issues ahead).<br/><br/>1) I have small hands. It can be hard to fit a large number of normal-sized dice in them. (Also applies to oversized cards, like ALL the normal Tarot decks. Also applies to computer equipment like keyboards and mice. And other stuff).<br/><br/>Because of the above, I use a bunch of small d6 when playing games with large dice pools. However...<br/><br/>2) I'm near-sighted. It's not very bad at the moment, but I can the potential in future when it'll be hard to read the pips on a bunch of small d6 in poor light conditions (that's most of the indoor games in the evening).<br/><br/>Plus...<br/><br/>3) If you're not very dexterous, a rolling bowl is important when handling a large number of dice. That means yet another piece of equipment to carry around. Not a fan.<br/><br/>Essentially, bigger is not always better, and does not contribute to the feeling of power as much when you physically can't control it with your hands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444800/#Comment_444800" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-14T17:10:58+00:00" title="April 14, 2015  5:10PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, 3Jane!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444801/#Comment_444801" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-14T17:39:15+00:00" title="April 14, 2015  5:39PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2015 5:39PM by catty_big.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And kudos for drawing attention to the difficulties faced by people in specific groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444802/#Comment_444802" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-14T19:28:14+00:00" title="April 14, 2015  7:28PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2015 7:30PM by Palimpsest.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a>; love all the classic cyberpunk references around here. Digression over. I had no interest in creating a sense of power with many dice, the start of the thread was really about practicality and I brought up Mythender to fish for people who had played with a great number of dice. I was using so many dice to achieve a specific mechanical effect, rather than anything subtler. Just as an aside, there are numbered D6s, most of mine are, but they might be few and far between elsewhere.<br/><br/>I guess that was another digression! I really appreciate your input. I think I've resolved to find a way to achieve my desired effect with much less dice. <br/><br/>Also, random question, I assume if you're holding tarot cards that means they're in some sort of hand, what kind of person thought it was a sensible idea to make a card game with a hand of tarot cards? I'm genuinely asking, I'm a tall guy, I have large hands, but I think I'd have trouble with a hand of tarot cards as well.

Anyway, I don't mean to say that you can't use large dice pools - it's just that you need to be aware of what trade-offs the players might need to make and you might want to mention ways of dealing with potential problems in your game text. I imagine it's like designing a game with miniatures - you need a case, a board etc.<br/><br/>With regards to Tarot, holding a hand of cards is not a problem. Holding a whole deck however, when you're attempting to shuffle them quickly, is a problem. It's this bit specifically that's difficult: <a href="http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Shuffle-a-Deck-of-Playing-Cards-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/670px-Shuffle-a-Deck-of-Playing-Cards-Step-2-Version-2.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Shuffle-a-Deck-of-Playing-Cards-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/670px-Shuffle-a-Deck-of-Playing-Cards-Step-2-Version-2.jpg</a> And it's twice as bad for most round Tarot cards because they're oversized in every direction!<br/><br/>(I can actually dealer-shuffle, and you can always scramble-shuffle, but both of these methods damage cards and you shouldn't do it to an art deck if you want to keep it alive for longer - decks do go out of print and then you can't buy a replacement for anything less then a couple of hundred dollars.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444807/#Comment_444807" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T09:00:41+00:00" title="April 15, 2015  9:00AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2015 9:03AM by Palimpsest.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>; I have a new way of doing this with three dice that makes calculating the chance of success a great deal more complicated, you seem to have a much better grasp of probability than I, so perhaps you might be able to give me your opinion on it?<br/><br/>Currently, I have it so you're rolling 3 dice. The Blue dice are D6 and the Red dice are D6+2. After rolling, you can spend a point to turn a Blue die into a Red die, or vice versa. I'm also planning on allowing the players to choose any combination of Blues and Reds amounting to 3. I like giving my players choice.

(For instance, you don't want a die combination which gives full successes when it succeeds, but doesn't succeed very often. That doesn't fit your design criteria, and isn't as interesting in terms of design.)<br/><br/>I would only allow different proportions of dice if you can find several combinations which give good odds, and then only allow those combinations. (It's no fun to find out that you chose an option which is unplayable or unfun, for example.)<br/><br/>As for your idea of switching dice types by spending a point, I can't say for sure because I don't know how your new system works, but I'd imagine the only reason I would ever do this is to upgrade one type of success into another. For example, I have a partial success, but I rolled a 6, and if I change it to a different colour, that becomes a full success.<br/><br/>If so, you can simplify things a great deal: just say that spending a point bumps you up one success level. Much easier to understand and remember, much simpler, and the same effect in terms of the game's design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444823/#Comment_444823" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-16T08:32:12+00:00" title="April 16, 2015  8:32AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2015 8:35AM by Palimpsest.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>; the goal of the new version is of course to meet my design criteria. It reaches 80%, it has a high chance of complication, you can only get a dramatic success while Learned/Experienced and you can succeed even after failing, but at a cost. By changing a Blue die to a Red die, you get +2 on that Blue die but at the cost of a complication. And just as you say, you can change a Red die to a Blue die. But I don't think it should be "upgrade one success level" because I don't want 1 point equals success. You should only be able to bump that Red to a Blue if it is a natural 6. Likewise, you should only be able to steal a success with that Blue if its result is 4 or higher.<br/><br/>If I were to make it a choice between 2 Reds and 1 Blue (79% chance of success, 75% chance of complication) and 2 Blues 1 Red (65% chance of success, 50% of complication) I'm not sure it would meet my design criteria as well. Obviously they have an equal chance to succeed if you factor in the points, but I'm not sure the decreased chance of complication is worth the decreased chance of success...or if that's even conducive to my design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444824/#Comment_444824" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-16T10:00:20+00:00" title="April 16, 2015 10:00AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that's just occurred to me: don't know if this will help any, but ISTR a while back someone posting a link to a website that calculates dice probabilities for you.

Red dice have a +2 modifier, Blue dice are unmodified.<br/><br/>After rolling, you can pay 1 to change the colour of one of the dice. For example, you might a Red natural 6, but because it's got +2 it's an 8. If you change the colour to Blue you take away the bonus, so now it's just a 6, but a Blue 6.<br/><br/>Part of how being Proficient/Learned/Experienced works is that every point you put into Proficient is doubled in Learned and Experienced, but you can only access these points if, you guessed it, you're Learned or Experienced. In order to turn a die "Yellow" you spend 2 points from either the Learned or Experienced pool. Thereby, you can only get a Yellow and a dramatic success if you are Learned or Experienced in whatever you're attempting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444843/#Comment_444843" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-17T16:17:06+00:00" title="April 17, 2015  4:17PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2015 11:16PM by catty_big.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Epic editing fail                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444844/#Comment_444844" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-17T16:19:28+00:00" title="April 17, 2015  4:19PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2015 6:29PM by catty_big.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I'm not complaining that the manual method isn't scientific enough, and I completely get your point about outliers -

I'm not sure it's more "scientific" seeing as this is to an extent a matter of taste, but I need to know the probability because I want to see a reflection of my intention in play. <br/><br/>There's a noticeable difference between 75% (3 of 4) and 80% (4 of 5) chance of success but you'd call both highly likely despite the practical difference between the two. If you were to get down to the rhythm of play, now, instead of four beats with a flat failure on the fourth there's now five beats with a flat failure on the fifth. I'm not going that in-depth, but it's an example of what a designer might consider.<br/><br/>In my case, I am just going for "highly likely" chance of success, but "highly likely" is relative. Not only that, but I want the "highly likely" chance of success to be higher than the "highly likely" chance of there being a complication to that success, so I have to get down to the numbers. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I could just make estimations. But as long as I have this mechanic, I feel I shouldn't. I feel that I should not leave anything as "an estimate". I should make sure everything is honed, leave no crevice unpolished. I feel to do less than that would be to let myself, my players and the game down.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444896/#Comment_444896" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-21T19:16:41+00:00" title="April 21, 2015  7:16PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly. Sometimes the precise odds aren't meaningful/important. At other times, a 5% difference changes the game completely. (For instance, giving monsters in a D&amp;D game a 10% of scoring a critical hit against PCs could easily mean twice as many character deaths in a typical combat; or introduce them, if your system had been set up to make them rare or nonexistent.)<br/><br/>A designer has to be very intelligent in figuring out when those things matter and when they do not; everything depends on the precise design in question and whether the specific odds matter or not. There are many, many big-name published games out there with mathematical problems in their mechanics (the White Wolf increased chances of "botch" outcomes being a classic example).<br/><br/>Palimpsest, I'll look over your new suggested mechanic sometime and see if I can spot anything. (Although I still find the necessity of adding numbers to a certain of dice inelegant. You can't simply say that they score a success on a 4+, or use d8s, or something similar?)<br/><br/>It might help if you tell me what you see as its strengths compared to my suggested mechanic, earlier. Then I can see if there's a way to amplify those features, and/or make sure they function as intended.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444898/#Comment_444898" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-21T20:07:21+00:00" title="April 21, 2015  8:07PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2015 8:11PM by BeePeeGee.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, it's more the <i>swinginess and predictability</i> of dice that makes the most difference in the feeling of a  game.<br/>For instance, rolling 4dF in a Fate game "feels" more predictable than a very swingy dice mechanic with i.e. exploding dice etc. This could i.e. possibly create a mood of "anything can hapen".<br/><br/>The effect of probability itself seems more negligable since usually a GM will - consciously or subconsiously - adjust difficulty rates accoringly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444902/#Comment_444902" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-21T22:09:26+00:00" title="April 21, 2015 10:09PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not all games involve rolls against difficulties set by the GM, BeePeeGee.

In this case, you get a 6, you succeed. Essentially, how I modify the difficulty in this game is: if there's no tension, you just don't roll. If there is tension, you do roll. What tends to happen to control especially difficulty tasks is that the more difficult the task, the harsher the consequences the players volunteer for themselves when they get that almost inevitable partial success. By placing the complication in the hands of the players rather than the GM you say to them "make this interesting." They know if they do go for that difficult thing, it will end badly for them, even if they do succeed by sheer luck (in narrative terms, obviously the game is designed so they will almost always succeed in some fashion).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>; much appreciated again. Ack, I think we got our wires crossed. Everything got across about how the colour-changing works, but you seem to be calculating for 2 Blues and 1 Red rather than 2 Reds and 1 Blue.<br/><br/>I'll definitely take the second system under consideration, but unlike in GUMSHOE points are a scarce resource. I should have clarified this. Essentially, what I want this "colour-change" system to do is rescue my players when they do roll that fail (because obviously, I really don't want them to fail) and reward them for advancing their proficiencies. The normal roll should already have a fairly high chance of success, complicated or no. My calculation was:<br/><br/>2D6 threshold 4 = 75% chance of success.<br/>1D6 threshold 6 = 16% chance of success.<br/>(75+16) - (75*16) = 79% chance of success.<br/><br/>Thank you for all your help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444907/#Comment_444907" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-22T14:02:07+00:00" title="April 22, 2015  2:02PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2015 8:18PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I got the die colours right.

In a game where dice are only rolled a few times a session, the actual empirical outcomes will likely diverge much more than the calculated percentage difference.<br/><br/>In other words: if you're designing a system where dice are rolled many, many times a session, then yes--the precise odds matter. In a system where the dice are infrequently rolled, and in small numbers, then there is very little practical (or experiential) difference between two systems that use the same rolls for very close odds. (Increasing the number of dice gives a different shape to the probability, of course, which changes things in other ways, e.g. BeePeeGee's point about swinginess versus stability.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444910/#Comment_444910" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-22T19:50:08+00:00" title="April 22, 2015  7:50PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2015 8:58PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

(If you like the general shape of them; for instance, increasing the number required for a full success would increase your odds of a partial success without changing anything else.)<br/><br/>What I like to do is to write out my ideal odds without thinking of mechanics or numbers or anything (kind of like you did earlier in the thread, but in more detail), and then see how close I can get with various mechanics. Sometimes it requires you to get creative! Other times, you can see that a good old d10 roll does the trick, which relieves you from a perceived need to come up with some terribly clever mechanic to impress your designer friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez" title="zedlopez"><img alt="zedlopez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez">zedlopez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444970/#Comment_444970" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-27T18:25:03+00:00" title="April 27, 2015  6:25PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2015 6:25PM by zedlopez.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>here are a couple of factors people may not have thought about when designing games with large dice pools [...] I have small hands.
