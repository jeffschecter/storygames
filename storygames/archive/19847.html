Why not use one of the many rule systems out there already?<br/><br/>This got me thinking about when is it necessary to make your own rules? Looking at story games they put together great rules in a page that work well to tell a story and many times they work to tell other stories as well. How do you choose which direction to go?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439905/#Comment_439905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T15:35:31+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  3:35PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I generally create a new system for one of two reasons: either I want the small, tight, to-the-point experience that only a highly specific custom job can provide, or the manner of play I'm envisioning has not been evocatively presented in a prior system, and I thus need to write a new one.<br/><br/>I would say that generally when I hear about people doing setting first game design, it is almost always the case that they're better off using an existing mechanical framework for their game. If at a later stage of design they grow dissatisfied with the limitations of the system, <i>then</i> that might be a reason to switch to a different one or create their own. It's a very poor starting point for game design to flow from a perceived social need for having your "own" system - novelty for novelty's sake, with no substance to it.<br/><br/>If the unique and worthwhile parts of your game are about the setting and situation, and you're agnostic about the specific methodology and mechanics of play, then you can totally slot your setting and content into a pre-existing system that you like. You probably should, unless you <i>also</i> happen to have unique and interesting thoughts about game structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439919/#Comment_439919" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T21:15:08+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  9:15PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's comments are to the point. I would have to say though, that favoring existing systems over new ones only provides two benefits I can see:<br/><br/>1. The game is more accessible. You could have a pre-installed audience.<br/>2. It can be easier to modify an existing system in terms of the labor and design skill required.<br/><br/>Designing your own system can have many MORE benefits though. So you would have to decide what's most important. Benefits of making a new system include:<br/><br/>1. Overcoming limitations of an existing system (like Eero said)<br/>2. Focusing the system around a specific play experience (again, Eero)<br/>3. Discovering new mechanics and moving the hobby forward<br/>4. Experimenting and growing as a designer<br/>5. Just the fun of it<br/><br/>And don't forget, you can always scrap what you make and accept it as a lesson \u2013 you're not married to anything you design!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439925/#Comment_439925" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T22:46:27+00:00" title="November  4, 2014 10:46PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a system but found it a bit clunky.

Also it doesn't move fast when you have to sit there rolling and rolling adding up the totals to do something. For a fast paced game vision the rules just didn't work out. But yes it is more setting than rules, I have huge amounts of setting.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the advice.

In reality, this is a smooth spectrum of varying degrees.  That's the first thing to keep in mind.  Any adaptation of a rules set will require tweaking the rules slightly, which is already on the path toward redesigning the game.  On the flip side, even wildly innovative games are built upon ideas, concepts and mechanics seen in prior work.  That's nothing to be ashamed of, it's just how creativity works.<br/><br/>For example, I've made three games built upon a chassis of <a href="http://catchyourhare.com/files/Cthulhu%20Dark.pdf" rel="nofollow">Cthulhu Dark</a>.  <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/so-now-youre-a-time-traveller.pdf" rel="nofollow">So Now You're a Time Traveller</a> is a pretty straightforward adaptation of the rules to a time travel setting, but that still required rethinking the rules and modifying them slightly.  <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ghost_lines-dark03.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ghost Lines Dark</a> pushes rules further afield, adding in several new special abilities, a second death spiral track and some other complications.  By the time we reach <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/devil-john1.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Devil, John Moulton</a> the game is nearly unreognizable: you have four death spiral traits, each with different die sizes, as well as card drafting for character creation and a bunch of other stuff.  Is that a new system by that point?  If I vary even more, does it become a new system?<br/><br/>Each rules modification you make is like replacing a board in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" rel="nofollow">the ship of Theseus</a>.  When does it become a new boat?  When does hacking a game become a new game?  Is that even a meaningful question?<br/><br/>My suggestion is to not worry about the false dichotomy.  Instead, take some individual rules you like.  These might be multiple rules or mechanics from the same or fromseveral different games or ideas you came up with yourself.  Put them together and see how they work out.  After trying it out, consider whether you need to add or subtract any rules to make it work better.  When you're done designing, look at your game.  If there are recognizable sourcesand influences, identify them as such.  If most of the rules you borrowed came from the same source, identify the game as an adaptation or hack of that game.  If you've borrowed from a bunch of places, simply cite those games as inspiration.  Give credit where credit is due.  In practice, the act of adapting a rule set to match a new setting and the act of creating a new game out of component mechanics aren't really all that different.  They're both parts of a spectrum of game design methods an dpossibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439960/#Comment_439960" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T16:20:10+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  4:20PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thing is, that dichotomy is not entirely false, either - Nick's certainly right in that modifying a system can flow into designing something entirely new in a fluid continuum, but that does not mean that there isn't a separate modality of creating-from-scratch <i>as well</i>. In my experience design from the basics up is very different as a practice from design-through-adaptation. I might even say that this realization is a cornerstone wisdom for me, as it is for many Forge survivors <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>It's not a problem to do iterative hacking, certainly, but it can become a limit to your creativity if you don't realize when an old chassis is holding you back. Often creative destruction is central to going forward, and that is more difficult when you're being tied down in prior design instead of starting from an empty table, entirely free to build up the gaming experience from first precepts.<br/><br/>A minor point certainly, I just wanted to log the opposing viewpoint on the matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439966/#Comment_439966" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T20:48:52+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  8:48PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2014 8:49PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's for the same reason that, despite all of the basic story plots being written so many times over, people still write stories.

Likely it will consume a lot of your time (possibly distracting from whatever you're working on now).<br/>* You will probably learn about stuff you didn't know about before (maybe layout, or probability math, or history, or something else altogether).<br/><br/>Once it's finished:<br/><br/>* It will probably mean that fewer people will ever play with you/play your game.<br/>* For the people who do see/read/play your game, you will receive more criticism (because you're putting more of your creation/original material/ideas out there).<br/>* You might stumble upon/create something completely new and different, perhaps intentionally, perhaps by accident.<br/>* You'll get more attention from designers/people who like reading new rulesets (many of these people ignore "game fluff" but are interested in new rules and procedures).<br/><br/>If you're not sure how you feel about all that, I think the best advice is to go with a system which seems to match what you're looking for, and start there. If it doesn't do quite what you need it to, you'll realize it at some point and start hacking. If that reaches a point where starting from scratch seems easier than hacking, you'll know you're better off designing a new system.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440140/#Comment_440140" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T07:45:22+00:00" title="November 16, 2014  7:45AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New rules are needed in order for the mechanics to accurately reflect the feel of the fiction it is representing. Let me give you some old school examples from Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying System:<br/><br/>In the case of Call of Cthulhu, the only real modification was the addition of Sanity to the system. BRS was heavy on the combat, but at the time all RPGs were like that. The Sanity trait helped reflect the loss of one's mind over time while encountering the Horrors in the fiction. It is still a successful and popular game.<br/><br/>BRS did not do so well with its adaptation of Elfquest, however. The system was heavily modified to accommodate the powers of the elves in the comic series, but the creator, Wendy Pini, complained about the heavy emphasis on combat. All RPGs were like that at the time because of their outgrowth from war games, but the mechanics did not match the fiction. A new game should have been designed in that case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440185/#Comment_440185" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-18T16:38:31+00:00" title="November 18, 2014  4:38PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Imo you can learn a lot from: <br/>a)hacking/expanding existing systems <br/>b)converting a setting to another system.<br/>While you are busy trying to figure out the details, you get to appreciate how much thought a designer has put into an existing game.<br/><br/>I usually develop entirely new systems for one-shots or as a rules-lite system with a unique approach.<br/>If you want to develop something from scratch, I think generally it's smart to start with a simple, basic system and let it evolve through playtesting and feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
