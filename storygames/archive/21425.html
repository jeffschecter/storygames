It forces the character to think about some other being's wants and needs, thus making them sympathetic. Not to mention the sense of empowerment, of being in charge of someone else's life. Personally, I've found pets are a great way to have a power fantasy without needing to ignore the narrative. Try raising a monster without having it eat you. I don't know about you, but I think an alien locust would make a pretty cool friend. Just sayin'.<br/><br/>The closest thing to a pet game I know is the Sidekick character feature in GURPS, where you create a character to be controlled by the GM. D&amp;D also has Ranger companions, but those aren't pets in the sense the player controls them. They aren't pets so much as extensions of yourself, which removes the need to think about someone else. There's also some <a href="http://pokemontabletop.com/" rel="nofollow">fanmade Pokemon tabletop games</a>, but a quick skim of their rulebooks and I can feel the D&amp;D influence. As in, if you're not fighting things, you're doing it wrong.<br/><br/>Anyone know where I can raise a pet? Or do I need to design this myself?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468914/#Comment_468914" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-14T21:21:42+00:00" title="January 14, 2018  9:21PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2018 9:22PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting question, I get what you mean.<br/><br/>I have two basic answers. The first is <i>Sorcerer</i>, which is basically the Pokemon rpg you'd want to have. Certain core assumptions we have about this pet thing (it being a dialogue between the players, and the pet having fundamentally inhuman needs and wants) are fundamental design elements in the game. It might seem to be more "brutal" than one would expect of a tamagochi game, but when's all said and done, your sorcerer character chose to summon a demon (whatever that means in setting terms) and take responsibility for it, for good or ill. Maybe the demon will help him work out his other life problems, or maybe the demon will just create more of them.<br/><br/>My second answer is <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, particularly with my expansion/revision <i>World of Near</i>. It's much less focused than Sorcerer out of the box, more like GURPS, but the tools are there and it works great for this kind of thing. Very good if not everybody wants to play pokemon masters, as it's just one not-particularly-prominent direction out of many.<br/><br/>There's a big bunch of other games that are good for this sort of thing, too; those are just what came to my mind first. Anybody have first-hand experience of that "a boy and his dog" playbook I saw once for <i>Apocalypse World</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468915/#Comment_468915" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-14T21:23:54+00:00" title="January 14, 2018  9:23PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Witch Quest, you can play a cat which is raising a witch.

It is true that the game's default genre and such make the relationship seem really morally dubious, but the description of the care commitment itself is entirely straightforward: the demon has Needs (what it has to have to remain on this plane of existence) and Wants (what it desires, given a chance). Ignoring or fulfilling either of these, and how you do it, is the game of demon maintenance. Sorcerer is basically <i>Tamagotchi</i> bolted onto a drama engine.<br/><br/>Characterizing that as either "caring for" or "exploiting" the creature is a determination of a much too high pay grade for me - I'd have to witness how the relationship is played out, on a case per case basis, to make the call. Certainly I don't think that the demon being potentially useful necessarily means that you can't be caring for it. The game text is very explicit about the idea that you're responsible for your pet even if it proves non-useful in your current situation: the demon has its Needs and Wants whether it inconveniences you or not, and that doesn't stop just because you no longer need the demon. Better have a solid exorcism plan if you want to send the demon up to the farm once you grow bored with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468924/#Comment_468924" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T00:44:13+00:00" title="January 15, 2018 12:44AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2018 12:44AM by Rafu.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I remember Vincent Baker has mentioned playing a Pokemon game by <i>Sorcerer</i> rules with his kids, hasn't he?<br/><br/><i>Anima Prime</i> by Christian Griffen sports solid rules for managing summoned entities in fight/action scenes (based on the "summon" attacks in Final Fantasy games, but quite more in-depth). <i>Rooksvale</i> by Avery Alder was an Anima Prime campaign setting (presented as a self-contained game IIRC) really focused on this aspect - in many but not all ways a "Pokemon" RPG (although whatever discussion about it focused on its provocative modeling of gender).<br/><br/>Doesn't <i>Ryuutama</i> include any pet-raising aspects?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468926/#Comment_468926" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T04:44:13+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  4:44AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, everyone!

The pet needs to be entirely useless for it to count? A sheep-dog can't be a pet in a meaningful sense? Interesting if so.<br/><br/>The way I see it, there's nothing in the Sorcerer rules that guarantees that demons are useful. There's also no trivial way of discarding the responsibility of basic care. There's nothing preventing a Sorcerer from having emotional attachment to a demon, but neither does the game guarantee a loving relationship with something fundamentally different from you. There are many ways demons can cause trouble. All these are basically direct similes with how responsibility for a pet works. I can't help but see this labeling as romanticizing the culture and reality of keeping animals as pets. Somehow other animal affairs are "caring" by default, but when it comes to demons it's "exploitation" now.<br/><br/>What if your sorcerer encounters a stray demon and has to decide what to do with it? Unlike the initial demon you get at character creation, you've had no say in creating this one. It's also not just going to go away if you decide to ignore it. Will you do the humane thing and arrange to have it terminated (banish it), or will you decide to keep (bind) it? Maybe give it to somebody who'll take care of it - good luck with that, I've yet to see the Sorcerer setting with a stray demon hospice. All told, I don't see this as much different to a fantasy game where your character meets a dragon and decides to take it for an animal companion, except the rules are distinctively focused on the whole affair in comparison to D&amp;D.<br/><br/>(The one big rule that Sorcerer has that really differs from how animal pet-keeping in real life works is the fact that summoning a demon is a Humanity risk, while it is generally held that animal companionship is a humanizing experience. I find this a minor detail in the overall picture, and an exciting one at that - maybe it <i>should</i> distance you from your fellow humans a bit when you have an amazing magical beast best buddy.)<br/><br/>Is the relationship that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hero_6_(film)" rel="nofollow">Big Hero 6</a> depicts between Hiro and his pet robot Baymax an exploitative one? Baymax has super powers after all, but then again it's depicted in a way that makes the exploitation accusation seem pretty harsh. Does this mean that it does not count as a "having a pet" situation thematically? I ask because to me that whole movie reads a lot like a pretty light-hearted Sorcerer scenario.<br/><br/>In systemic terms the one big, fat advantage that Sorcerer has for pet thematics is that it's a fantasy game about fantasy critter ownership that explicitly vests the responsibility for the paranormal (whatever that means in the setting) on the GM. The demons are part of this paranormal realm, which means that their nature truly is opaque to the other players, to be discovered in play. You can parse it together from the particulars of magic in the setting, you can make guesses from how the demons act, but it's nothing like having a pet dog and getting to debate with the GM about how the dog "would" act. I think this is pretty interesting, and again, thematically relevant to real pet ownership: you don't get to decide how your dog should act, even when it decides to do something wonky. The dog decides, and so does the demon.<br/><br/>A Lassie type "boy and his dog" set-up would be amusing for Sorcerer just for how it would cast the human and animal worlds in a stark contrast. Animals would be the "demons" in this relatively normal-human setting. Crocodile Dundee would be a "sorcerer", as would anybody else who interacts with animals willingly and successfully. The human/demon distinction would presumably be about the nigh-impassable divide that cognition (or original sin, or whatever) has caused in between man and beast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468955/#Comment_468955" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T00:06:32+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 12:06AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like an off-topic philosophical debate!

Let us be so far honest towards ourselves! <br/>- <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/nietzsche/1886/beyond-good-evil/ch09.htm" rel="nofollow">Beyond Good and Evil</a></blockquote>\nThe counterpoint is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" rel="nofollow">Tragedy Of The Commons</a>. To quote Wikipedia:\n<blockquote>In 1833, the English economist William Forster Lloyd published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.</blockquote>\nSo, can caring for a creature out of self-interest be morally right? Is self-interest moral? If so, when?<br/><br/>Personally, I view pets as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract" rel="nofollow">social contract</a>. That is; so long as we both can agree, it isn't exploitation. If neither party has a reason to agree, then a contract can't be established, and the pet and pet owner are in conflict with each other. That is, they aren't pet and pet owner any longer.<br/><br/>How to morally negotiate and resolve disputes is the hard part. Deceptive practices, contracts signed under duress, all that fun stuff. I've been working under the assumption that someone needs the be the "owner", but as someone who's owned a cat, I know the line's pretty blurry. Though this might be a semantic problem; you can solve the debate by calling your pet your friend, albeit someone with wildly different wants and needs. Which, as a friendly person myself, I'm inclined to do.<br/><br/>So what does this mean for pet games? I'm willing to label any game that primarily focuses on relationships as a pet game, so long as the participants each have wildly different needs. I realize "wildly" is a fuzzy word, though I'm not sure how else to phrase it.<br/><br/>Back on topic, I've checked out most of the games on the list and I'm formalizing my thoughts. I'll have a post either later tonight or tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468956/#Comment_468956" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T00:33:23+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 12:33AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2018 12:34AM by Rafu.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They say dogs have owners, while cats have household staff.<br/><br/>As for the highbrow <i>Sorcerer</i> debate, I disagree that the game-mechanical concern of Humanity can be dismissed as just a mere footnote to it - that's just too central to the game. Whether we portray demons as relatively benign "pets", sentients being exploited as tools or malignant schemers exploiting the sorcerer, it is a fact of the game as written that entering a relationship with them signifies a step down the ladder of self-destruction - a ladder at the bottom of which is the condition of <i>not being human enough a character to be interesting as a protagonist</i> anymore.<br/><br/>Whatever setting you paint with <i>Sorcerer</i> rules, there has to be a negative element to sorcerer-demon relationships, and that negative has to be strictly related with a core thematic conflict you want to play out. In this light, playing a game of <i>Pokemon</i>-themed <i>Sorcerer</i> as a metaphor of the real-world relationship between humans and working animals strikes me as entirely appropriate - as long as we adopt the ground view that such a relationship is indeed fundamentally sketchy and unwholesome (the game does leave some space for a player-character to prove otherwise, but that's going to be an uphill battle).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468960/#Comment_468960" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T01:36:00+00:00" title="January 16, 2018  1:36AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mostly agree with your various points, Eero.<br/><br/>I especially dig your point about the GM representing an unknown domain (demon life / animal life) to the players.  I think that's especially present in Sorcerer in the case of demons who can't talk.<br/><br/>I still think Sorcerer is a game about exploiting demons, though, for two primary reasons:<br/><br/>1) Although the game doesn't <i>force</i> you to play a sorcerer with a specific motivation for demon-binding, it definitely does lay out the expectations.<br/><br/>2) Those expectations are that your demon (not to mention your actions in acquiring it) is anathema to regular human existence.  This is made clear by all the color surrounding summonings, bindings, demon types, wants, and needs, and by the rules for banishing.  A demon is, nearly by definition, <i>a thing you shouldn't be dealing with</i>.  The very, very obvious reason why you <i>are</i> dealing with it is quite clear: power.<br/><br/>If your sheepdog came with as many downsides as a demon does, you probably would find another way to herd sheep.  Either that, or you'd be a pretty cutthroat steward of this dangerous tool, and treat it less like a useful pet and more like a useful weapon.  I think there's a world of emotional/moral difference in that distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468966/#Comment_468966" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T03:18:57+00:00" title="January 16, 2018  3:18AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time for analysis. I've tried to keep it brief, but there's been a lot of games mentioned, and I wanted to give them all their fair share. Let's go through the list:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> I'm having trouble justifying the 15$ for <i>Sorcery</i>. From what I've heard, I'm having trouble morally justifying sorcery in the first place, which presents a big hill for any narrative to climb. And there's some worries over execution that give me pause. But seeing how it's wildly influential, I'll probably cave one of these days.<br/><br/>I couldn't find <i>World of Near</i>. Any chance you could provide a link? (google news: putting "World" and "Near" in the same search box brings up a bunch of articles about how the end of the world is near)<br/><br/>I was able to find <i><a href="http://downloads.darkon.info/pdf/tsoy.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Yesterday</a></i>. I skimmed it and found it hard to parse. I can't wrap my head around how the game actually plays. There's mechanics, but I couldn't figure out when to use them. It left me confused and frustrated.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> You piqued my interest in <i>The Quiet Year</i>. After some google-fu, I found <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-deep-forest.pdf" rel="nofollow"><i>The Deep Forest</i></a> by the same designer. Considering <i>The Quiet Year</i> costs money and <i>The Deep Forest</i> is a free "reimagining" of <i>The Quiet Year</i>, I figure I'd view <i>The Deep Forest</i> as a sampling of what's on offer. I have some very complex opinions on <i>The Deep Forest</i> that probably need their own discussion, but long story short I'm not a fan. I don't see myself getting invested in the community, which means I don't see it working as a pet game.<br/><br/>So far, <i>Monsters and Other Childish Things</i> impresses me the most. Admittedly, I've kept my wallet shut for now (life is expensive), though the concept and pitch are the best so far. It's actually about pets! Well, you don't care for them, seeing as they're eldritch monsters of unspeakable horrors with little needs of their own that you're not raising...but they're pets! And having a little kid teamed up with a freakishly strong monster has potential, at least as a concept. Kid gets access to awesome powers, monster gets friendship. I like friendship. Add in humor, some style points, and it gives me some reason to play. Flawed, but I'm not fundamentally opposed. It's on the wish list.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> I've found <i><a href="http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/docs/Anima_Prime_CC_04-07-2011.pdf" rel="nofollow">Anima Prime</a></i>, but I couldn't find <i>Rooksvale</i>. It's not listed on <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/" rel="nofollow">Avery Alder's website</a>, and the google keeps asking if I meant Brooksvale (google news: searching for "Brooksvale Avery Alder" brings up...happy massages)<br/><br/>For completionist's sake, I decided to check out <i>Anima Prime</i> for the summoning rules. Like with The Deep Forest, I found myself disagreeing with some core design philosophies, though these are more focused on practicality. Again, it probably deserves its own discussion, though the short version is that I don't see myself being able to trust the narrative. Though there's one quote I have to share:\n<blockquote><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part I: The Basics</span></b><br/><br/><b>1. Introduction </b><br/>You\u2019re most of the way through it already.</blockquote>\nI love it when games are fun to read.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That's all I've gotten to so far.

Caring for your animal would be a central part of the game. The animals health and obedience would likely be tied to the care you give your animal as well as a randomizing element (D rolls).

I guess you could jettison the Humanity subsystem and still be left with a useful game-mechanical chassis. All things considered, I do believe all RPG enthusiasts should give <i>Sorcerer</i> a try eventually, but I don't think you must buy the book now just because of this thread.<br/><br/><i>World of Near</i> is notoriously impossible to google. ;-D It being a supplement to <i>The Solar System</i> by <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> himself, which is the most up-to-date rendition of Clinton's <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, I believe the reference site for both is still Eero's own at <a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/solarsystem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/solarsystem</a> - There, you'll be able to buy <i>The Solar System</i> and <i>World of Near</i>. You'll also find links to wikis which are supposed to represent the most current versions of the game system(s) and be free to read (right, Eero?) and might (or might not) help you better understand how to play <i>TSoY</i>. All of the above being released under various free cultural licenses, I suppose someone might be willing to just e-mail you the files. I believe all of that is only tangential to the current discussion, though, as a framework you might use to create your own game (sort of like <i>GURPS</i>, though I believe <i>TSS</i> compares very favorably to that).<br/><br/>I haven't played <i>The Deep Forest</i>, but out of reading it some time ago I understand it to be mechanically the same as <i>The Quiet Year</i> except for a greater emphasis on naming and describing individual community members (there is less in the <i>TQY</i> - and that may actually be a deal-breaker). Having played <i>TQY</i> a couple times, I've found it an <i>extraordinarily good</i> game - truly wonderful. However, I agree about it being very far from a close fit.<br/><br/>I'm curious what you disliked about <i>Anima Prime</i>. I've played that game a bit, enough to confirm it works quite well for what it sets out to do, but I do believe some core gameplay matters were better explained in some of the betas than in the final release version - which slashed some essays originally found in the appendix. I do think it as good or superior to other games with similar creative goals, such as <i>Dungeon World</i> and <i>FATE</i> - but I admit I'm not as experienced with those.<br/><br/>Turns out it was <i>Rookvale</i> with no "s" in the middle. I have the files on my hard disk and the license allows for sharing them, so PM me an e-mail address and I'll send 'em your way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468969/#Comment_468969" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T10:20:39+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 10:20AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, since you seem to be on a reading streak, as <a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">@Wilhelm</a> mentioned <a href="https://yarukizerogames.com/2010/02/11/witch-quest-book-ii-release/" rel="nofollow"><i>Witch Quest</i> is worth checking out</a> too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468971/#Comment_468971" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T11:26:49+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 11:26AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TSoY is a moderately complex game, comparable to GURPS - as Rafu says, neither it nor <i>Sorcerer</i> are really worth it if you're looking for something quick and effortlessly entertaining - you know, an actual fun game rather than a process [grin].<br/><br/><i>World of Near</i> is indeed somewhat difficult to find anywhere at the moment.

For instance, <i><a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-deep-forest.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Deep Forest</a></i> assumes the players will attempt to work together, which I believe is unrealistic. Similarly, I found <i><a href="http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/docs/Anima_Prime_CC_04-07-2011.pdf" rel="nofollow">Anima Prime</a></i>'s conflict resolution to be naive. I didn't see much guarantee the players will collaborate, which makes it unlikely I'll enjoy the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how popular my view is, which is why I went overboard in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21429/lets-talk-about-friends" rel="nofollow">that spin-off discussion</a>.

(Due to the open culture publishing model there's no real central publisher for TSoY, so I guess being the third major iteration of the game makes mine the 3rd edition by default.)

My take on "uncertain" for TSoY is "not 100% guaranteed in the fiction, and of dramatic interest to the group".  The game seems to be used more as a story engine than a simulation engine, so fictional uncertainty by itself is insufficient for extra attention and die rolls.<br/><br/>As for Deep Forest, although it uses the same basic system as The Quiet Year, it doesn't make the point nearly as clear.  In The Quiet Year, all the players are trying to help their village survive and thrive -- that is literally the activity of play.  There's nothing else you can do <i>but</i> work together.  That doesn't mean you have to agree with each other, though!  Do or don't -- either way works.  When I played, I found the issue of agreement/disagreement on particulars to be quite secondary to the larger unity of all caring for the village.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468986/#Comment_468986" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T23:36:51+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 11:36PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Uncertain action" is, simply speaking, old outdated jargon: a game text showing its age.

I had a DM who killed off my Druid's pet Wolf because I said it could go hunt something in the forest to get something to eat and he said it didn't have a pack and would starve to death...<br/><br/>And another DM said a pet Raven/Familiar would be more loyal and powerful if they raised it from a chick. the next scene that it was old enough to "do things" it got shot to death by bandits when the PC asked the Raven to fly up and see how many there were what was going on...<br/><br/>I ran Solar System + World of Near at a convention and got a full group. It was super fun! I have a Creative Commons version of the PDF (no art). I can get it to you Eero if you don't have it anymore.<br/><br/>Yeah, I remember first learning TSOY and asking questions about the system and inevitably, the answer was. It means what your group agrees it means...<br/><br/>I would be interested in some kind of play where a Pet was role played in a meaningful way and was of some utility to whatever goals the PC was trying to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
