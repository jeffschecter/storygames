Now with added keys and secrets! Woo!</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a three player game with Captain Vance, the Lady Blackbird and Macaya the bodyguard, and even with the Lady Blackbird's player being fairly passive it still went pretty damn well. Only one kinda issue:<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the asymmetrical relationships between the characters, and ya know, enforced by keys, it rewards playing to the dynamic. But, maybe I should've swapped Macaya's (Naomi) and Lady Blackbird's players around. As it was, Macaya's player was really domineering and eventually betrayed the oddly passive Lady Blackbird. I mean, that exact example of asking questions happened, with the Captain ordering Lady Blackbird's bodyguard around, but she was always fine with it. Does that seem like a problem I should've addressed, or a legit way for things to play out (in one session)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, many thanks to the main man, Captain Harper, and double thumbs up from all players, and some amusing confusion:<br/>\nThem:<i> "I really like this system; what's it called?"</i><br/>\nMe:<i> "Uh... Lady Blackbird?" </i><br/>\nThem:<i> "That's the scenario, yeah, but what about the rules?"</i><br/>\nMe:<i> "Uh..."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe confusion might not've been helped by one of our impromptu table rules: during refreshment scenes we got beer and rum and sang sea shanties. Playing as pirates is its own reward, I guess. ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nCollaboratively made at the table:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Flint sat upon his throne<br/>\nwith his flag of skull and bone,<br/>\nBut I kicked him down and took his crown:<br/>\nI am the Pirate King!<br/>\n<br/>\nFlint with black curses mocked<br/>\nAnd shaked his black iron flintlock,<br/>\nBut a slash of blood on to the mud:<br/>\nI am the Pirate King!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Flint was thrown to ocean spray<br/>\nAnd nary a man for him did pray,<br/>\nHis ghost did wail but on we sailed:<br/>\nI am the Pirate King!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_205108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205108/#Comment_205108" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T23:43:23+00:00" title="May  3, 2009 11:43PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds great, Richard!<br><br>Oddly passive players are, as odd as it seems, a frequent occurrence in this interactive hobby.

So great.<br><br>The thing with asking questions is that sometimes they're leads, like, "She slaps him, doesn't she?" and sometimes they're actual questions like, "Have you ever seen something like this before?" but either way, they don't have a set answer. So when the Captain orders Bishop around, and you prompt Lady Blackbird to do something, it's totally okay if the response is nothing. That outcome, with a passive Lady Blackbird, is just as valid, story-wise, as a confrontation with Vance. Let the consequences fall where they may, then wait for your next opportunity to push.<br><br>Of course, there could be group dynamic and player engagement issues going on, too. But you'll have to address those outside of game play.<br><br>Oh, also: I like your new Keys and Secrets!
