This got me thinking: Beyond the simple desire to create, design, and share.... Is the point of creating a new RPG about unique settings with mechanics to enhance, or about creating unique mechanics with a setting to enhance, or something in between where the two are embedded together?  At what point does a game designer say, "I could do my idea in this existing RPG, but it would be better if I made my own"?<br/><br/>Did any of that make sense?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61839/#Comment_61839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T10:25:48+00:00" title="March 22, 2007 10:25AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2007 10:26AM by Andy.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The correct answer is, "When that designer wants to".<br/><br/>Innovative in mechanics? Innovative in setting? Those are RPG consumer reasons for why they purchase/like the games they do. It's not an objective category for a designer to follow.<br/><br/>They should design what they want to do, in the way they are doing it, for reasons only clear to themselves.  Unless they like freelancing, in which case they should design what they are told to design.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61849/#Comment_61849" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T13:44:32+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  1:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I design or buy a game if it can give me a new play experience.

It took me a while to chew through ORE and there are games (Tri-Stat, d20) where I've actually been forced to give up reading the rules for fear of boredom closing down the creative part of my brain. It's probably a consequence of getting older but I find I don't have time to read complex rules. I just can't be arsed. This is very different to my teens when I devoured MERP, laughed my way through RoleMaster, ran a few combats in Phoenix Command and made my own "gun game". An innovative mechanic - whoosh, it'd have to be easily explained in ....less than a minute to hold my attention. So, in essence I'm unlikely to like a game with a boring extensive original game mechanic that lacks consistency mainly because I won't be bothered to read it. A game would either have to have an established system (one I already have in my head) or something REALLY lightweight.<br/><br/>Now, innovative settings are where it's at. I love them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61867/#Comment_61867" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T16:55:32+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  4:55PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games just lend themselves to tinkering and inspire creativity.  I believe it's a natural facet of the experience of "play."<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone ever played a RPG without house rules?  I think the point where you have a system that you like, but it needs to many house rules, is a point where you might think about making your own game.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPGs are also all about setting, if you don't like a published setting but like the system, that is what designing your own campaign is all about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like the most ambitious players might do both and create an entirely new game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the kind of player that also doesn't get too hung up on rules.  I play a lot of GURPS, heck I've even run a few sessions, and I can't say that I've read all the rules.  But we do have some guys who know the rules pretty well so they rarely get in the way, and I've learned them over time by playing.  In the meantime I just focus on the story and do what I think would come natural to my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am working on a design for Game Chef that still hasn't quite made it even to first proof prime-time, mainly because I want to make something that is really different.  That's not easy to do, but I hope to corner it before the deadline.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61875/#Comment_61875" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T18:37:03+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  6:37PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most games I've bought over the last five years were games that seemed to do something that I wanted out of other games but wasn't geting. I bought Exalted becasue it was what I wanted out of D&amp;D;, for example. Or that was the case. More recently I've been hooked by games that offer something I didn't know I wanted. I never knew I wanted a game where traditional verbal communication was disallowed, but as soon as I saw Primitive I was hooked. I never knew I wanted to end a messy relationship with a were-rat, but I bought It Was A Mutual Descision after just hearing the premise. There are a number of games I have bought over the last 2 years (or would like to buy) that have sold me on net settings or mechanics. In most cases these the ideas in these games are not things I would have otherwise been interested in.  I took the same appporach to Panty Explosion, in that I assumed that most gamers, left to their own devices, wouldn't use their regualr game top play "psychic schoolgirls, but might really like a game wher ethat was the focus.\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">At what point does a game designer say, "I could do my idea in this existing RPG, but it would be better if I made my own"?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI think many of the games made by people here and at the forge are games that wouldn't work in another system. Games that require they're own system to do the concept idea justice. Whether these games started as house rules for another gme, or as an idea that just couldn't be apl;lied to any other game system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
