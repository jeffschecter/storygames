I am a lawyer. For the record, I don't practice in the area of intellectual property; however, I am self-taught in that area due to my publishing side-line, and I feel comfortable in my knowledge based on my general legal-education framework. More importantly, almost all of my work is in contract law, and the GSL is, in the end, just a contract. In reading some of the threads, I've seen some patently incorrect assumptions about the terms of the GSL (and many others that I think are arguably wrong), so I decided to start a new thread to answer people with specific questions about it. I will give you my best answers. Where I think the answer is unclear, I will tell you why and give you both sides.<br/><br/>This is not a thread for discussing the philosophy of open gaming, WotC's motivations, etc. This is a thread for nuts-and-bolts discussion of what the GSL means and does.<br/><br/>Also, I feel obliged to note that posting in this thread does not create an attorney-client relationship between us. I am not giving you legal advice. I am a lawyer giving you my personal opinion about the GSL. I hardly think it is necessary, but I want to personally disclaim any liability for anything you might do based on reliance about what I say in this thread. In fact, you affirmatively should <i>not</i> rely on what I say in this thread. If you want to make a business decision about what to do, you should consult a lawyer. If you desire, you can contact me off-list for a more formal conversation.<br/><br/>EDIT: I'm okay with other people who believe they have a similar level of expertise giving their insight in this thread as well. I don't want people speculating. If you're not sure, frame it as a question--not a belief. Let's keep this thread as questions and <i>answers</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151340/#Comment_151340" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T07:39:06+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  7:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2008 7:40AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Justin: What does the GSL *allow* you to do, exactly?

Thanks for doing this.  As I mentioned in Stuff To Watch, there was all this talk -- before the GSL was released -- about restricting third-party publishers to only producing fantasy materials, but it seems like, if you were willing to accept all the rules of D&amp;D as is, since you aren't allowed to change them, you could publish, say, a John Carter of Mars RPG or even a superhero RPG where you described all new classes, races, powers, skills, feats, weapons, and the like.  You couldn't do Mutants &amp; Masterminds GSL, because you'd have to keep hit points and falling damage and everything else the same, but you could have your Paragon Class that starts with flight and powers that do lots of damage from punching and ranged heat vision and the like. And then do a bunch of other superhero classes. Yeah?<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment, as a designer, is the restriction from playing around with the core of the game to create variant rules.  With all the terms nailed down to specific meanings and mechanics, that's a pretty strong limitation.  It seems like you can broaden the meaning of a term (this is basically Jason's question) but you can't restrict it or change it even slightly.  The closest thing you can do, if I'm reading it right, is explicitly restrict existing rules and offer replacements with entirely different names.  Like, if I don't like the Charge rules, I could say "This module doesn't use the Charge action described in the 4e PLAYER'S HANDBOOK.  Instead, it uses the Onslaught action described below."  Does that seem like an accurate reading?  If so, I guess that means you could potentially even say, "This module uses the following actions from the PHB: move, attack, double move, a few more.  All other actions are not really meant to be used with this module as written, but your play group may find a way to incorporate them in."  That has potential, I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151369/#Comment_151369" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T08:41:30+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  8:41AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The license includes numerous clauses which remain in effect after termination.

Continuing the example, you could not say that your new race has "Lance of Faith" as an at-will racial power, but it does 1d10 damage instead of 1d8.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151385/#Comment_151385" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T09:11:39+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  9:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, thanks for doing this! <br/><br/>- Can WotC revoke the GSL at any point?<br/>- If yes, are there any limitations?<br/>- What actions must WotC take to revoke the GSL?<br/><br/>- Can WotC alter the GSL at any point?<br/>- If yes, are there any limitations?<br/>- What actions must WotC take to alter the GSL?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

There is nothing in the GSL that bears on genre, color, etc. I could, for example, re-do Dawning Star with velin as a new PC race. Interestingly, I would have to rename humans, since I cannot alter the definition of the existing human race in the SRD.

Let's start with the GSL itself. It does indeed provide for termination or alternation at their discretion and without notice. There is nothing preventing them from canceling the GSL altogether one week after your shiny new 4e supplement is in the supply chain.<br/><br/>Checks: Obviously, there are social checks, i.e., bad PR from a modification of this sort that would be seen as simply "abusive", no obvious commercial motivation for such a move, etc. But that's not much of an assurance. I do think there are general principles of contract law that can protect against such a move. Notably, any contract (and the GSL is, at its heart, just a contract) includes an implied covenant of good faith.<br/><br/>I could conceive of a scenario like this: A third-party publisher prints up 10,000 copies of their new 4e campaign setting. The distributor is filling orders from retailers, when WotC releases an updated GSL that says you can't publish campaign settings. The third-party publisher could viably argue that WotC breached the implied covenant of good faith, which might open up other remedies, e.g., waiving their right to enforce it. This argument is bolstered by the language in Paragraph 11.3 about extending the license on a case-by-case basis.<br/><br/>There are other, related legal principles that might apply similarly. In short, the prospect of such a scenario doesn't personally concern me (not the least of which because I won't be printing up 10,000 copies of anything), but I can't give you a rock-solid legal basis for saying it is not a problem.<br/><br/>This is also a good place for me to mention that I practice in Florida. As a rule, I am familiar with Florida law. By its terms, the GSL applies Washington law. As a rule, I know nothing of Washington law. I am talking about general contract law. Specific applications might indeed vary based on the unique implementations of Washington law.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151398/#Comment_151398" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T09:32:03+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  9:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd be easy enough to monkey with powers, I suspect, by naming something, say, "Lance of Zeal" or "Exalted Lance of Faith" and having it do 1d10.<br/><br/>I'm still going over it myself.

Jacobson</cite><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Hey, Justin: What does the GSL *allow* you to do, exactly? It talks a lot about what's prohibited, so I'm unclear as to what is actually allowed that would be clearly legal under fair use.</blockquote>\nAt its most basic, the GSL allows you to use selected portions of the D&amp;D 4e core books. This is something you could not otherwise do under simple intellectual property law. The restrictions are in what you can use and how you can use it.<br/><br/>As a random example, you could release a series of NPC pdfs. One might be a cleric. You could indicate that the cleric has the "Lance of Faith" power. You could not otherwise do that absent the GSL. "Lance of Faith" is their IP.<br/>Well, this is a tricky point.  You should make clear here that they do not own the game system -- methods and systems cannot be owned via copyright, only specific expressions of them.  Within the computer game world, it has been substantially shown that simply being compatible with a system does not show copyright infringement. In  "Galoob vs Nintendo" , the Game Genie by Galoob was shown not to infringe on Nintendo's copyrighted system which it altered. In  "Sega vs. Accolade", the Sega-compatible games by Accolade, Inc. were shown not to infringe on Sega games. Connextix has similarly made products usable with other games successfully, with court decisions to back them up.  The key in these cases is that the compatible games did not reproduce substantial portions of the original game code. In contrast, "Atari vs Nintendo" found that Atari's Nintendo-compatible games did copy verbatim large portions of the original code (which they obtained through surreptitious means), and were found to have violated copyright. <br/><br/>In the nineties, companies like Wizards of the Coast would publish D&amp;D-compatible supplements without permission from TSR.  They would use generic spell names like "Magic Missle", but they avoided spells with character names like "Melf's Acid Arrow" or "Bigby's Crushing Hand".  This was never decided within the courts -- though the fact that TSR did not sue them does suggest that it is legal.  Also, parallel cases like the video games above seem to support this.  <br/><br/>But I guess this is really a question:  Do you think that the AD&amp;D-compatible supplements and modules prior to 2000 were generally legal?  Or do you think they were illegal and TSR simply failed to pursue its rights?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Answers above.<br/><br/>But, and this is a big "but", I cannot discern anywhere in the GSL that prevents you from using earlier versions of the SRD. So, by my reading, if your product complies with any version of the SRD, it's permissible under the GSL. I don't know if this was intentional or an oversight. (My guess is the latter.) This is a very close reading of the terms of the GSL, but I think it's right. In any case, I'm guessing they will clear it up soon enough.<br/><br/>Looking at it in greater detail: Paragraph 4.1 allows you to use 4E references "described in the 4E System Reference Document as presented in the file "SRD.pdf" that is available for download at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/d20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/d20</a> ("SRD"), incorporated herein by reference." The SRD that I download today meets that criteria two weeks from now, two months from now, or two years from now. Per paragraph 2, by using the 4E references, you agree to the changes to the License, but there is nothing that says you have to use the "last updated" version of the SRD.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151408/#Comment_151408" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T09:56:02+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  9:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2008 11:44AM by jenskot.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, you rock! <br/><br/>More questions:<br/><br/>If WotC terminates the GSL or alters it in a way that makes your GSL product invalid, can you covert your product to the OGL?<br/><br/>The GSL, section 6 seems to indicate that their OGL restrictions survive the termination of the GSL.

Is this true?<br/><br/>Additionaly, several people have indicated that if WotC were to take legal action, that the GSL, section 10, indicates that the Licensee may be held accountabe for WotC's legal fees. Is this true?<br/><br/>For reference:\n<blockquote><cite>GSL</cite>6. OGL; Conversion<br/><br/>6.1 OGL Product Conversion.

Upon the first publication date of a Conversion, Licensee will cease all manufacturing and publication of the corresponding Converted OGL Product and all other OGL Products which are part of the same product line as the Converted OGL Product, as reasonably determined by Wizards (\u201cConverted OGL Product Line\u201d). Licensee explicitly agrees that it will not thereafter manufacture or publish any portion of the Converted OGL Product Line, or any products that would be considered part of a Converted OGL Product Line (as reasonably determined by Wizards) pursuant to the OGL. Licensee may continue to distribute and sell-off all remaining physical inventory of a Converted OGL Product Line after the corresponding Conversion is published, but will, as of such date, cease all publication, distribution and sale (and ensure that third party affiliates of Licensee cease their publication, distribution and sale) of any element of a Converted OGL Product Line in any electronic downloadable format. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) any OGL Product that is not part of a Converted OGL Product Line may continue to be manufactured, published, sold and distributed pursuant to the OGL; and (b) this Section 6.1 will survive termination of this Agreement.<br/><br/>6.2 No Backward Conversion.

Could I post in my blog: "The Lance of Faith cleric power is totally broken."? Of course. Could I release a D&amp;D 4e supplement under the GSL and use a small bit of "terminology" that is not identified in the SRD as long as I give proper credit? Absolutely not. Could I release a D&amp;D 4e supplement <i>not</i> under the GSL that uses some of the "terminology" found in the books without running afoul of general copyright law? Probably, but the answer is so vague and unattached as to be unhelpful to the discussion. And, as an aside, I don't think there is any question that WotC could reasonably claim a trademark on "Lance of Faith" when used as a character power in a fantasy-based rpg.

You don't give away your rights to your creations under the GSL. If I create a new feat called Death Blow and publish it in a 4e supplement, I still have the rights to the creation. I can turn around and publish an OGL supplement with the Death Blow feat in it (assuming I am willing to cut ties with 4e/GSL of course).<br/><br/>This does raise an interesting point of difference between the old OGL and the GSL that I don't believe I've seen mentioned elsewhere.

Jacobson</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Justin, thanks for replying! My understanding is, and it may be wrong, that Section 5 of the OGL deals with having sufficient rights to contribute your original material as OGC. Although this may not be the original intent of section 5, it could act as a justification for revoking OGL rights. If you break the GSL agreement, and want to publish your work as OGC under the OGL, you may no longer have the sufficient rights to do so<b>(since you gave them away by signing the GSL agreement)</b>. In this case, you would be in violation of the OGL, section 5. Which could them trigger section 13 of the OGL, which states that if you fail to comply with all terms detailed in the sections of the OGL (section 5 in this case), then you have 30 days after becoming aware of the breach to fix the issue, otherwise your OGL license is terminated.</blockquote>\nI think the bolded portion of your post is the problem. You don't give away your rights to your creations under the GSL. If I create a new feat called Death Blow and publish it in a 4e supplement, I still have the rights to the creation. I can turn around and publish an OGL supplement with the Death Blow feat in it (assuming I am willing to cut ties with 4e/GSL of course).<br/>I just had a lawyer affiliated with our company (who used to be a gamer, Call of Cthulhu specifically, I just found that out!) look at the license. He agrees with your interpretation. He indicated the only "punishment" he could see is in section 11.4 which is questionable. <br/><br/>He also pointed out that you could license a 3rd party setting and use the GSL to produce a game for it (albeit one that requires the core books). And that WotC can terminate individual licenses (vs. the entire GSL) but must submit a written notification to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

To address your example, you could certainly create a GSL setting that has demons called Daeva and fighters called Warriors. However, you cannot give people rights that you yourself don't have. So, you can give them rights to reprint your Daeva statblocks, but I don't see how that would side-step the GSL. Also, as a general point, if you find a way to screw WotC, they can just singly terminate your rights to use the license anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151526/#Comment_151526" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T15:34:36+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  3:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2008 3:35PM by morgue.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen claims that s7 (reproduced below for reference) will prevent:<br/>* depiction of characters in anything other than monogamous hetero relationships<br/>* brothels as adventure locations<br/>* depiction of societies where blacks or gays are a hated underclass<br/>etc.<br/><br/>This seems like misinterpretation to me; I don't see how any of the above are prevented by s7.

All Justin's disclaimers about this not being legal advice apply to anything I say as well.  And this is to address a narrow slice of the overall issue that interests me in particular.  This is Justin's thread, very kindly offered by him, and I don't want to derail anything.<br/><br/>In open source software, most licenses don't contain a provision that requires license users to update to the most recent license.  The Open BSD or Apache licenses, for example, may have several iterations, but none of them require you to upgrade.  Hence the confusion in the open source community, as various applications are in play that have different versions of given licenses.  In the case of the GPL, you have a fork between GPLv3 (Stallman) and previous versions, such as GPLv2 (Torvald).  Commercial licenses, by contrast, almost always contain trigger provisions that let the licensor terminate the license or revoke and reissue.  Whether or not such language ever gets used or enforced, it grants enormous power in the IP owner.<br/><br/>The clause that says the 4e license may change at any time, in combination with the requirement that the licensee has the responsibility to keep their licenses current with the latest version seems to add up to a de facto automatically updating license.  The interesting question is whether a hard copy released product under version X is somehow subject to updated terms from version X+1.  My guess is: Maybe.  The automatic trigger that puts all responsibility on the publisher to keep the license terms current might lead to problems.  Publisher could put out Book-A in compliance with the license current at the time of publication.  Wizards could subsequently publish a new license with changes that put Book-A in violation.  If you're in violation of a license, the proper recourse is either (a) pay Wizards some amount of money as compensation, or (b) pull all unsold instances of Book-A from commerce.<br/><br/>Practically speaking, Wizards isn't necessarily going to broadly tar its licensees.  But the license does give them the ability to amend it as they see what's coming out of third party publishers.  In a practical sense, if they file for an injunction requiring a small press publisher to withdraw product for violating the terms of a license, only the gutsy folks willing to put money up front are going to resist.<br/><br/>One thing, however.  I don't believe Wizards can put out a license and then create micro-versions targeting individual publishers.  In other words, they can't create a special separate license that makes it harder for Justin in particular to publish his books.  They can negotiate a separate agreement with Justin that offers him a separate license, but I don't think they can impose it on him to the exclusion of anyone else.  I don't have any source for this assertion other than that I don't think public licenses can be targeted at individuals in the absence of contractual consent by that individual.  Maybe I'm wrong, though.  Maybe Wizards could put out a license that says, "We don't like Justin and if you're Justin or Justin's company, this license is denied you."  Practically speaking, it'd be more trouble than it's worth, aside from the negative PR.<br/><br/>I suspect they will monitor third party product as modify the license to make it narrower if they feel that helps protect their exclusive control of 4e IP.<br/><br/>To chime in on Sean's question....  If you create a product that is all setting and original material, and it references plug-ins from Wizards, I think you're fine.  By saying, use the Fighter template for Warriors, etc., I don't see a violation.  And "demon" by itself is not a term or concept owned by Wizards.  As long as you reference the material from the DnD books accurately and without modification, and keep your original material separate, I don't see a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151529/#Comment_151529" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T15:44:43+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  3:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morgan, the money shot is this: "At a minimum, the Licensed Products will conform to community standards of decency and appropriateness as determined by Wizards <i>in its discretion.</i>" (emphasis added)<br/><br/>If someone at Wizards decides brothels are off-limits, bam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151531/#Comment_151531" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T15:52:10+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  3:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, slightly related question to what I think Sean was asking.<br/><br/>Say I create a pseudo-MM, a Book of Ghastly Beasts.

So absent any clause that says they cannot terminate the license by written notification to a given licensee, I think they can according to Section 11.1.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite> Those are not normal publishing conditions that I can't make a publishin plan, because I don't know, when and how will the contract change wich I signed.

Actually, this is similar in some ways to the D20 System Trademark License.  There WotC also said that they could update the trademark license.  However, the D20STL provided a 30 day "cure period" during which the licensee could change their product and sell off existing stock to match the new terms.  The GSL specifies that termination applies immediately with no cure period.  The effect of termination is explicit from Section 11.3:\n<blockquote><i>Upon termination, Licensee will immediately cease all use of the  Licensed Materials and will destroy all inventory and marketing materials in Licensee\u2019s possession bearing the Compatibility Logo.  Licensee will remove the Compatibility Logo from all advertising, web sites, and other materials.  Licensee will solely bear all costs related to carrying out this provision (in addition to any other provision) of the License.  Wizards may, in its sole discretion and upon written agreement between Wizards and Licensee, extend this License for those Licensed Products that otherwise comply with the terms of this License.</i></blockquote>\nThat's roughly the same as the D20STL after the cure period -- the licensee would have to destroy non-compliant products.

They are grants to use something (property, specified equipment, a particular trade).  For example, most contracts aren't revocable at will.  Many licenses are.  I'm pretty much sure Wizards can't legally force the destruction of inventory, for example, though they can prevent that inventory from being introduced into commerce or released to the public.  Licenses are agreements regarding the specific IP being licensed.  They can contain some viral provisions, these usually trigger upon specified conditions such as release or distribution of the IP in question.  However, from a practical standpoint, Wizards could condition continued 4e licensing for an individual publisher on receiving some kind of proof of the destruction of inventory.<br/><br/>Wizards is making the IP available under the license.  Unless they spell out further obligations they are undertaking, that's it.<br/><br/>John, I haven't read through the whole thing.  That's a good catch.  Wizards can simply notify anyone and restrict on an individual-by-individual basis.  Good to know.  There's a lot of discretionary language in there.<br/><br/>Practically speaking, this license encourages third-party publishers to send their work to Wizards for pre-vetting to ascertain whether they're violating the license.  In tandem with the individual termination powers, this gives Wizards de facto filtering power.  If Wizards terminates or declares someone in violation for whatever reason, that person is pretty much stuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan" title="Rskennan"><img alt="Rskennan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rskennan">Rskennan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151544/#Comment_151544" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T18:46:04+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  6:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My question is regarding interactive products.

Are you asking: Can I create a book of original monsters under both the GSL and CCA, using the statblock template found in the SRD? Yes. I'm not sure how that creates a black market though. The third person could not use the statblock template unless they too use the GSL.

Those are not normal publishing conditions that I can't make a publishin plan, because I don't know, when and how will the contract change wich I signed. This is totally abnormal. I mean in the old OGL (if I read it right) if I accepted its terms, I could use it from that on without being afraid that they will change it at once. It's like two people would sit down and sign a contract, wich sais that one of the contractees can change anything in the contract and the other contractee have to abide the changes without renegotiating the contract, simply by signing it firsthand. I won't even send him an e-mail or publish the change, the other contractee should regularly check the site where I uploaded it to see, whether I uploaded a new version in that very second the book arrived in press. That's just nonsense.<br/><br/>So my question is: how can this be legal? Is this legal at all?

There are only a few kinds of contracts that are literally illegal, e.g., indentured servitude. There are a few more that are unenforceable. This varies by state. For example, in Florida, an oral personal guaranty is not enforceable. The part you're missing is the mindset: It's their IP; they don't have to let you use it at all, and they can create virtually any set of rules they want to put up to let you do so. Yes, the OGL was far broader. This is much more comparable to the old d20 STL.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

A contract is any legally enforcement agreement between parties. Kinda circular, right? You are correct that, for a contract to be binding there must be "consideration". A gratuitous promise is not enforceable. In the GSL, Wizards consideration is the granting of the right to use their IP (and the compatability logo); your consideration is the agreement to do so under the rules they've laid out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151687/#Comment_151687" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T12:12:31+00:00" title="June 19, 2008 12:12PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2008 12:17PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not sure how that creates a black market though.</blockquote>\nJustin, I meant in the sense that... Say Green Ronin comes out with a MM-equivalent under the GSL and declares that anyone can reprint these monsters in adventures.  Then, third party GSL publishers might start generally using Green Ronin's monsters when building adventures, because they desire the ability to reprint monster stats. Eventually, fewer and fewer folks publish GSL adventures that references the MM, because looking up monsters when you're running an adventure is a royal pain.

They are grants to use something (property, specified equipment, a particular trade). For example, most contracts aren't revocable at will. Many licenses are. I'm pretty much sure Wizards can't legally force the destruction of inventory, for example, though they can prevent that inventory from being introduced into commerce or released to the public. Licenses are agreements regarding the specific IP being licensed. They can contain some viral provisions, these usually trigger upon specified conditions such as release or distribution of the IP in question. However, from a practical standpoint, Wizards could condition continued 4e licensing for an individual publisher on receiving some kind of proof of the destruction of inventory.</blockquote>\nA license is just a special type of contract--the granting of a right. It is still a contract. I'm not sure why you doubt their right to enforce a destruction clause. If that's what the parties agreed to, they could elect to sue for specific performance, and if they prevail the property would have to be destroyed. If the party failed to do so, they could be held in contempt of court.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Say Green Ronin comes out with a MM-equivalent under the GSL and declares that anyone can reprint these monsters in adventures. Then, third party GSL publishers might start generally using Green Ronin's monsters when building adventures, because they desire the ability to reprint monster stats. Eventually, fewer and fewer folks publish GSL adventures that references the MM, because looking up monsters when you're running an adventure is a royal pain. Can you imagine something like that occurring?<br/>Gotcha. Yes, I think that would be fine under the GSL. I don't think that is likely to happen.

In some instances, these kinds of things would be fine; in others, not. General copyright law cannot be summarized or boiled down to a few forum posts. To use an apt phrase, I'm not touching this one with a ten-foot pole. Sorry.<br/><br/>I'll tackle it -- <br/><br/>Yes, you can do that.<br/><br/>From <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl108.html" rel="nofollow">the US Copyright Office</a>:   <br/><br/><i>"The idea for a game is not protected by copyright. The same is true of the name or title given to the game and of the method or methods for playing it.... Copyright protection does not extend to any idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in the development, merchandising, or playing of a game."</i><br/><br/>Backed up by the 9th Circuit Court rulings on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/197_F3d_1256.htm" rel="nofollow">CDN Inc. vs Kapes</a> -- <br/><br/><i>"In order to protect the free exchange of ideas, courts have long held that when expression is essential to conveying the idea, expression will also be unprotected.\u201d</i><br/><br/>and <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/copyright/cases/allen_vs_academicgames.html" rel="nofollow">Allen vs Academic Games</a>--<br/><br/><i>"\u201cIdeas contained in a copyrighted work may be freely used so long as the copyrighted expression is not wholly appropriated. This doctrine of merger is particularly applicable with respect to games since they consist of abstract rules and play ideas."</i><br/><br/><br/>So, as long as you don't use WOTC-created creatures (stick to mythological, or original), which could be argued as unique IP, you can produce support without using <i>either</i> the GSL or the OGL.     Case law is established on this point.<br/><br/>Of course, that doesn't prevent them from suing you anyway -- you'd have to defend it in court.    They might file a nuisance suit (or at least threaten on), on the assumption that most games publishers don't have the means to engage in a suit, or even the knowledge that they can.    <br/><br/>It's the same tactic that Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. tried to do us at Adamant over our MARS rpg.    We had our lawyer respond, making it clear that a) we knew our rights; b) we knew what we were doing; and c) we were more than willing to fight them over it....<br/><br/>They dropped the matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151880/#Comment_151880" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T11:30:11+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 11:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 11:30AM by jhkim.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an old set of pages about copyright and games at: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/copyright/" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/copyright/</a><br/><br/>It was last updated several years ago, so it won't have anything on more recent decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

A license is a contract, it's just a particular type of contract. Can you give me an example of a license that is not a contract? It doesn't take much to make a contract.<br/><br/>Me: "Hey, you, can you watch my bag while I run to the restroom?"<br/>You: "Sure."<br/><br/>Boom, contract.

What we're talking about here is the difference between equitable remedies and remedies at law. As I mentioned upthread, in Florida, you would likely be able to sue for specific performance. I don't know the answer under Washington law.

So, short answers:<br/><br/>1. As a technical matter the errata is generally modifying language you couldn't use under the GSL anyway, e.g., power descriptions. The errata does not appear to be incorporated into the SRD, but I'm comfortable that you could treat the fixed item as such. Example: You publish an adventure that uses a monster with a push ability that has been changed from 2 squares to 3 squares in an encounter with a lava pit. You could have text that says: "Tactics: The monster tries to use its push power to push any PCs within 3 squares into the lava pit."<br/><br/>2. Generally, violation of a license is not a criminal matter and would not inolve extradition. WotC could sue an overseas violator in the violator's home country. (But likely could not sue them in Washington for lack of personal jurisdiction.) As a practical matter, a small-fry publisher in an obscure country engaging in a minor violation would not be worth their time or effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152477/#Comment_152477" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T14:38:14+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  2:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I should open up a publishing house in Belarus?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152488/#Comment_152488" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T15:01:54+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  3:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, it does not need to be some tiny balkan state: US jurisdiction likely cannot be enforced in any EU state, given the much more strict rules about protection of the signer of a contract.<br/><br/>A couple of publishers (including the one actually publishing dnd in italian) recently told me that if WotC tried to sue, a simple appeal would move the case to italy [*], and that most of the harsher clauses are 99% void in italy (just with the software EULAs, and such).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Oliof">@Oliof</a>: problem is, you could only sell to other "small" countries (read: not the US) because your product could probably be considered illegal in the USA (or at the very least WotC could scare the hell out of distributors menacing to sue over it, regardless).

It would have lots of reptiles, and specifically, player characters would be lizardfolk, kobolds, and nagas. Those three creatures are in the Monster Manual, and one of them - the kobold - has a section in the back describing how to use it as a race. Each creature type has subtypes (lizardfolk darter, kobold slyblade) which would make great classes.<br/><br/>If I wanted to use these creatures as races, defining what that means for a player character, as they don't have current PC definitions, could I? In the case of the kobold, would I have to stick completely to the current text, or could I change it? Could I add to it?<br/><br/>For the classes, could I use the name "Darter" from "lizardfolk darter" to describe a class? What about a paragon path only available to lizardfolk? In a vaguer example, there's a "lizardfolk hunter." Could I reuse "hunter" as a class name, given that separated from "lizardfolk," it's a common word with an established meaning?<br/><br/>Thanks again for doing this. I know my questions are crazy specific, so if it's trouble to answer them, don't worry about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153577/#Comment_153577" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T13:27:36+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  1:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2008 1:28PM by noclue.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, I have a question.

It would have lots of reptiles, and specifically, player characters would be lizardfolk, kobolds, and nagas. Those three creatures are in the Monster Manual, and one of them - the kobold - has a section in the back describing how to use it as a race. Each creature type has subtypes (lizardfolk darter, kobold slyblade) which would make great classes.<br/><br/>If I wanted to use these creatures as races, defining what that means for a player character, as they don't have current PC definitions, could I? In the case of the kobold, would I have to stick completely to the current text, or could I change it? Could I add to it?<br/><br/>For the classes, could I use the name "Darter" from "lizardfolk darter" to describe a class? What about a paragon path only available to lizardfolk? In a vaguer example, there's a "lizardfolk hunter." Could I reuse "hunter" as a class name, given that separated from "lizardfolk," it's a common word with an established meaning?</blockquote>\nMostly okay. The one problem you will run into is the prohibition, per Paragraph 4.1 of the GSL, against defining, redefining, or altering the definition of any 4E Reference in a Licensed Product. So, to be clear, you cannot reprint the text about kobolds, and you cannot use the term kobold and give it different stats. You can add to a meaning. So, you could do a write-up for a PC version of a monster that doesn't otherwise have one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I'm actually quite okay with the GSL. Barring anything unusual, I intend to port Dawning Star over when the work up the modern version. The only problem the GSL has is that it came after the OGL and suffers by comparison (from the point-of-view of the third-party publisher). There's no question that the new license is less friendly to 3PP, but I'm fine with it, principally because of (a) the market forces that discourage outright screwing of 3PP, and (b) my ability to work on a smaller scale and, thus, minimize my exposure in case I am wrong about (a). Now, if I were, say, Green Ronin, I'd be much more hesitant. But I'm not. Usually, that's disappointing, but not in this instance I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153618/#Comment_153618" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T18:24:09+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  6:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Justin,<br/><br/>I think we're getting into a bit of legal esoterica.  We should probably agree to disagree on the license/contract opinion.  I think you have a more expansive view of what makes a contract.  Your example doesn't include an exchange of consideration, for instance.  Bailment is more likely, but I don't have any interest in discussing that topic.<br/><br/>In the case of the GSL (having read it now), it seems Wizards can change the terms at will per Section 2 and make them automatically applicable to all licensees (not usually a contract feature) and retains very broad authority to revoke the license (or terminate the agreement, if you prefer) virtually at its pleasure via the Section 7 "quality assurance" language.  It is possible for a publisher of 4e material who can prove absolute fidelity to the license (which could be difficult in light of Section 7's broad discretionary language) to argue that the license by its terms is only revocable in case of bona fide license violation, but I think it's an uphill battle.  Plus, if Wizards really wants to revoke a particular license, they can modify the terms so that license is in violation and prosecute selectively.  It'd be a pain in the ass for them to do so, but if they do, I don't think anyone has a legal basis to argue about it.<br/><br/>There are some interesting questions about survivability that do give this license some contract-like teeth.  The survivability language is probably the clearest argument for contract-like langauge, and this is one area I suspect a publisher could prevail on in a challenge to Wizards.  In other words, if you convert your OGL material to 4e and make the new 4e material an official "Conversion," and Wizards revokes your license to publish your Conversion, provided you're not publishing other 4e material, I think you could go back and start to publish your stuff under the OGL again.  If Fantasy Flight Games updates Midnight to 4e, publishes a Midnight Conversion, and then Wizards revokes the license, I think FFG could prevail if it wished to return to publishing OGL Midnight material so long as it stops with any 4e Midnight content (which it would have to do anyway if the license was revoked).  But this is the thorniest question I see in the GSL.  It's basically saying, "if you accept this license and publish on it, you forego the right to use this other open source license forever, even after we revoke this license."  I don't know if that would stand up to legal challenge.<br/><br/>Let's say Wizards decides to bump out the publication date for third-party 4e material from October 2008 to October 2009, and in September, they update the GSL to state just that.  Would they be sued by people who spent time and money to make books for the 2008 date?  Sure, probably.  Would Wizards prevail?  I think the answer is clearly yes, by the terms of the license.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the only way anyone putting out 4e material under this license can be bulletproof in terms of not having the license revoked is to enter into an actual licensing contract with Wizards that locks in a version of the license alongside actual contractual protections, but that would certainly not be free.  All that said, I think Wizards isn't going to mess with most small-press publishers--but they do want a way of filtering third-party products so as to exert more control over their brand and their market.  The GSL certainly gives them a means to do so.<br/><br/>James, see the last paragraph.   But if you're seriously considering putting time and money into a GSL-based business venture, go see a lawyer in your home state/province and get legal advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I don't think its wise to bet the farm that those market forces are strong enough. Hasbro might just decide that they could be making all sorts of money if the 3PPs weren't cannibalizing their market share and rescind the license. They'd likely be wrong, but they might. So, the only way I see to play is to either (i) stay lean enough that rescinding the GSL doesn't sink you or (ii) work out a rider with WOTC that preserves your GSL rights for a fixed period of time (Green Ronin could probably swing that).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>James, see the last paragraph.

If I may amplify what he's saying....<br/><br/>"Kobold" in the GSL has a specific meaning, look and feel created by WotC.  Once you go under the GSL, you're explicitly accepting WotC's version of the term for purposes of your Licensed Work.  The same would apply for Dragon or Unicorn or Orc.  Outside the GSL, you can do whatever you like with kobolds (except clone Wizards' version).  Under the GSL, you might be able to create, say, "Azure Kobold" and make it a riff on the standard DnD Kobold.  I don't think you could take "Azure Kobold" and make something substantially different from the WotC Kobold, however.  And if Wizards subsequently comes out with their own thing called an "Azure Kobold," you might be obliged to redact yours from future printings of your product.<br/><br/>Justin, does that sound right to you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

But you can certainly create new, original artwork of things described in the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk%20Remmecke" title="Dirk Remmecke"><img alt="Dirk Remmecke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk%20Remmecke">Dirk Remmecke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155772/#Comment_155772" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T05:55:28+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  5:55AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2008 5:58AM by Dirk Remmecke.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin,<br/><br/>what is your opinion on this:<br/><a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?t=11100" rel="nofollow">Kalamar for D&amp;D 4</a><br/><br/>In short: Kenzer &amp; Co just published their Kingdoms of Kalamar as the first 4e compatible campaign setting without using the GSL.<br/><br/>The same topic in the Kenzer forum:<br/><a href="http://www.kenzerco.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38336&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">Kalamar 4th Edition?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155904/#Comment_155904" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T14:37:47+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  2:37PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>(To be completely honest, I expect that there will be a flood of amateur GSL products released that completely screw up insofar as adherence to the very-specific terms of the license, and that Hasbro legal will use that as the excuse to rescind the GSL, which WOTC folks are telling me they had to fight to release in the first place.)</blockquote>\nThat's very interesting. It seems entirely plausible to me that, should Hasbro vigourously decide to deny anyone other than themselves the space to provide material to support and foster 4e, they could slowly but surely slide back into a marginal position in the market, and other companies working creatively and co-operatively with one another take advantage of the more flexible legacy OGL/SRD to strengthen their position.<br/><br/>I'm thinking particularly of Paizo here, with their plans to publish a "Pathfinder" RPG which would essentially be 3.75, or similar.<br/><br/>It seems to me not crazy to think that the RPG market is so marginal in the first place that any single company just can't manage the overhead to maintain a large enough creative staff to provide product enough to satisfy the majority of the fan base.<br/><br/>Hasbro <i>needs</i> distributed support for their game and the subsidy of the spin-off marketing effect of having others shoulder part of the burden of that production, in order to keep the success of their own provided materials up.<br/><br/>Of course, that could all be wrong.

I suspect that WotC's contribution to that is pretty small, and of that most was from CCGs.  I doubt all the D&amp;D; sales in the universe would even cause a tremor in the Hasbro needle.  I'm only surprised that the mother company even permits a bunch of creative talent to expend that much time and energy on such small potatoes as 4E.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor perspective:  If WotC sells 400,000 copies of all of the core books every year and receives $50 in revenue from each set...that's about 1/2 of 1% of Hasbro's annual revenue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155914/#Comment_155914" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T15:09:29+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  3:09PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>For perspective:  If WotC sells 400,000 copies of all of the core books every year and receives $50 in revenue from each set...that's about 1/2 of 1% of Hasbro's annual revenue.</blockquote>\nThis is my point. Creating all that material to publish, all those words and images and playtesting, isn't without overhead. Hasbro is much too large to allow one of its divisions to return an insufficient ratio of profit on that overhead and investment for an extended period of time. If WotC can't make enough profit, they'll get cut back, spun off, or binned.<br><br>Given how small the RPG market is, I wouldn't be at all surprised if keeping up that profitability hinged largely upon getting other companies to help you keep your game selling well. But that's just a hunch, and not based on any kind of real hard numbers.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155917/#Comment_155917" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T15:15:33+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  3:15PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of WotC income I'm sure is, by FAR, from selling books derived from DnD settings.

As to whether that's a good decision or not, is a business question. I will say that, if you elect to go GSL-free, you better make sure you've done everything letter-perfect. I'm sure they're just waiting to pounce on someone who tries to go that route to set an example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156055/#Comment_156055" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T08:10:15+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  8:10AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Were the old terms of the OGL really so detrimental to Hasbro and WOTC?

However, "non-commercial Licensed Products (i.e. free)" are not limited by this, via an exemption later on in Section 5.4.<br/>\n<br/>\nA company has announced ( http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?t=236675 ) that they're giving away free Licensed Products real soon now -- as long as you first buy an unrelated, non-Licensed product from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that approach legal?  Is it non-contract-breaching?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about if I try selling people exclusive high-quality brown envelopes, and throw in a Licensed Product for free?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRoger                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6799/i-am-a-lawyer-and-i-am-answering-questions-about-the-gsl/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6799/i-am-a-lawyer-and-i-am-answering-questions-about-the-gsl">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6799/i-am-a-lawyer-and-i-am-answering-questions-about-the-gsl/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6799/i-am-a-lawyer-and-i-am-answering-questions-about-the-gsl/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6799%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6799%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
