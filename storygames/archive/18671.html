I'll posit a semi-hypothetical example, simplified from my actual campaign...<br/><br/>The party encounters a single big, armored monster - an enormous alien centipede.  The PCs are big armored fighter Gwen, sneaky thief Rat, and Thistle the druid.  Gwen steps forward for sure to attack it.  Rat and Thistle are not as good in fighting - they have less damage and less armor.  Fighting the centipede, they would take more damage than they dish out.  The question is, what do Rat and Thistle do?  <br/><br/>There's the "Mob" approach, where everyone rushes the monster.  There's the "Tag-Team" approach, where Gwen fights the monster one-on-one, then tags out when she runs low for someone else to step in.  And there's the "Backup" approach, where Gwen fights and the others rally around and help her attacks.  \n<ul>\n<li> The "Mob" approach is presumably everyone doing Hack-and-Slash moves.  Rat and Thistle will take a lot of damage by doing this.  It might be the quickest in some sense, but it probably multiplies out the total damage they take. </li>\n<li> The "Tag-Team" approach means that Rat and Thistle aren't rolling at first while Gwen does Hack-and-Slash, then they switch in to do their own Hack-and-Slash.  Gwen takes the brunt of damage, but the total damage everyone takes is probably less. </li>\n<li> The "Backup" approach means that Rat and Thistle are rolling Aid moves.  This is a little less risky than Hack-and-Slash, but they are still risking damage - and their success is a +1 to Gwen's roll rather than their own damage. </li>\n</ul>\nIn practice, we have been doing the Mob approach for big monsters - but I think there's something to be said for the Tag-Team approach.  How do other people approach this - either as MC or as player?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419333/#Comment_419333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T18:04:31+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  6:04PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2013 6:05PM by akooser.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm can none of those be an option?

I think we would run mostly. Or maybe stay waaaaaay back and try to set it on fire. Certainly I don't think anybody would be keen to go toe-to-toe with it. Trying to Hack N Slash something like that really only makes sense if you have some way to keep it from hitting you right back. If it only has pincers at one end, I can imagine somebody trying to lasso and pin its head or jaws while the others try to attack it from behind or maybe even underneath, where it's less likely to have armor. In general, though, I tend to think of DW fights as much looser and less "each player makes a move in turn" than what you're describing above.<br/><br/>It might go:<br/><br/>P1: I'll try to lasso its pincers and horns with my rope.<br/><br/>GM: Cool. That's probably Defy Danger with DEX, with the danger being you get its undivided attention.<br/><br/>P2: I want to help!<br/><br/>GM: Okay, how do you help?<br/><br/>P2: I'm going to try to get its attention by banging on my shield, so it won't see the rope coming.<br/><br/>GM: Sweet, roll them bones.<br/><br/>P1: An 8.<br/><br/>P2: +1 on Aid... so still a 9. <br/><br/>P3: Crap.<br/><br/>GM: Your rope is totally caught between it's horns and mandibles. It yanks back and pulls you slightly off the ground, but its head is caught for now. Your tough choice, though is... do you yank back on the rope and get it's attention, or do you let it focus on chewing through the rope or focusing on one of your companions?<br/><br/>P1: Well, I'm a self-interested thief, so... sorry you guys.<br/><br/>GM: It's going after the one making all that racket. Giant rope-tangled head coming right at you; what do you do?<br/><br/>P2: I raise my shield to bash it in the face!<br/><br/>P3: While it's head's down, I stab it in its many eyes with my blade!<br/><br/>P1: It's lowering its head? I'll reel in all the rope and tie it to one of the stone pillars, to try to hold it in place!<br/><br/>GM: Awesome. Let"s handle those in order. P2, roll Defend.<br/><br/>P2: 10+! Sounds like I might need this 3 hold.<br/><br/>GM: Probably! The centipede's metal-reinforced head slams into your shield. Roll 2d6+2 damage and let's hope it doesn't break your arm.<br/><br/>P2: 12 damage, ouch. I spend one hold to halve that to 6, and then [uses armor and shield to reduce a bit more]. I also spend one to open the centipede up to an ally.<br/><br/>P3: Nice, so then I stab its eyes!<br/><br/>ETC.<br/><br/>There's basically not a lot of OOC planning that happens once a fight starts. It's moment-to-moment decision-making based on whatever crazy stuff is happening in the fiction at the moment. Sure, the players can try to plan things ahead of time, but once things actually get moving, they're reacting to and building on things that have just been said. Sometimes they're all doing different things at once, sometimes they're helping one another, sometimes they're doing stuff that involves formal moves, sometimes they're just doing stuff in the fiction that doesn't require a move. Honestly, it doesn't really sound much like any of the models you're describing, but maybe I'm just thinking about it differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blurry" title="Blurry"><img alt="Blurry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blurry">Blurry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419342/#Comment_419342" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T19:06:20+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  7:06PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My approach would actually be to have more stuff in the encounter for the non-fighty characters to do that isn't "hitting the main bad guy."

I think it goes up in usefulness a lot with level - so maybe that will be more common for us.  <br/><br/>I think I was presuming in my initial example that there wasn't space to get good ranged shots on the thing.  When that is possible, though, it's a question of how much relative safety there is.  For example, last time our ranger tried firing an arrow at a monster I was fighting, I got hit in the back.  Generally speaking, my GMs have it that rolls of 6 or less always have significant negative consequences, even for Volley.  \n<blockquote>There's basically not a lot of OOC planning that happens once a fight starts.

On the other hand, I suspect you're talking about something different - that I discussed my approaches analytically whereas you wrote out word-by-word dialogue for your example.  For example, it seems like after reading my after-the-fact, OOC analysis, you're drawing the conclusion that my games in play were characterized by OOC planning.  In play, there is almost no planning in our fights.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419368/#Comment_419368" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T11:02:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2013 11:02AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2013 11:05AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. No OOC planning is good. <br/><br/>The reason I wrote out the example, is that (1) everything comes from the fiction, so it's difficult to talk about without that context, and (2) to show that there are attacks that aren't Hack N Slash (the rope using Defy Danger, the shield bash using Defend, an infinite number of other things) and helping that isn't Aid (both the rope thing and the cooperation between the shieldbearer and the stabber). <br/><br/>Thinking in terms of the moves you have available to use rather than the fiction can make DW seem much more repetitive and less interesting than it otherwise might be. IME, it's better to just say what a character does and then the group can figure out what moves that involves later. I honestly don't know what moves the characters are going to make in a fight until they start doing stuff.

You do teamwork by thinking of something that will help the team, trying to do that, and then making whatever moves you trigger along the way, or just doing it without a roll.<br/><br/>There are lots of situations where PCs can deal damage without "hack-n-slash" rolls, for example, if other elements of the action have gone their way. Especially when a team is fighting a big monster that isn't super fast. If the warrior is fighting it toe-to-toe (hack-n-slash) and the thief and druid attack it from behind at the same time, it might not be able to reasonably "fight" all three of them, so some characters don't roll hack-n-slash, they just get to damage it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419375/#Comment_419375" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T12:11:19+00:00" title="August  1, 2013 12:11PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2013 12:16PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup.

At some other time, the ranged striker might be in the spotlight - say when fighting a bunch of orc archers firing from across a chasm.  <br/><br/>There is sometimes a presumption that all PCs must be equally involved in all scenes, but I don't think that's necessary.  The thief might disarm the trap mostly on his own rather than having everyone trying to work on it.  Similarly, the giant centipede might be mostly a challenge for the armored knight to fight, and not as much of a scene for the others.  \n<blockquote>Yeah.

You think of something that will help the team, and you do it.  That's what my post was about - asking about how people do this and resolve this.  Sometimes different things can help.  For example, if the thief is working on disarming a mechanical trap, sometimes the most helpful thing is to stand back and being quiet rather than jumping in to work on it too.  <br/><br/>On the question of resolving it.  It's a good point about acting without a roll.   That's an interesting secondary question - how do you handle ganging up in melee?  In my experience, whenever we as PCs attack an active enemy, we have always rolled Hack-and-Slash based on the trigger ("When you <b>attack an enemy in melee</b>") or a class-specific move.  However, I see how you could interpret some attacks as not being "in melee".  <br/><br/>In practice, how and how often do you decide to let PCs do damage to an active enemy without a roll?  As I've said, I haven't seen this done in the games I've played, so it's interesting to compare experiences.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419450/#Comment_419450" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T13:16:38+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  1:16PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 1:18PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the "melee" part is meant to mean "they're fighting back, toe-to-toe with you."

Sometimes a monster can melee with multiple opponents because of the terrain or their size or speed or weapon(s) or whatever. Sometimes they can't melee at all.

For example, Gwen the fighter is off by herself in a wide hallway when two orcs rush out of the darkness at her.  She backs up towards the wall to defend against them while lashing out at them with her sword.  Does the second orc do damage regardless of roll (i.e. the usual in John Harper's games, as I read it)?  Does the second orc do damage only if she fails her Hack-and-Slash roll (i.e. the usual in my games)?

I don't think there's a right answer, and so ultimately it's always down to MC judgement (for which there is no convenient principle in this case). My own analysis is that this works really well in a drama-driven game about tough choices (after all, if we're trying to show the consequences of violence, it doesn't matter whether she has to roll twice or not, that's just a detail) but is pretty awkward if you're looking for a strategic battleground on which players can compete or face challenges.<br/><br/>I'd be happy to be proven wrong, though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419468/#Comment_419468" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T16:35:03+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  4:35PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "maybe" depends on the fiction.<br/><br/>- Is the hallway wide enough that one of the orcs can circle around and come at Gwen from the other side? Then she probably just takes damage from that one unless she has a special move or something that lets her engage with two opponents at once, or describes some way of keeping both of them off her. Maybe she has a sword and a spear, for instance, and can use the spear to keep one of them at length while chopping at the other with her sword. Might be Defy Danger to try to do that effectively!<br/><br/>- Is Gwen able to manuver such that one orc steps in front of the other and gets in the way of the other one joining in (might be a DEX move of some kind to do that)? Great! Then, for the next move or so, she only has to worry about one of them at a time!<br/><br/>- If she can't manage to do either of those or something else, then the 2nd orc just hits her, right? Not much she can do about it. But she could try to Defend herself instead of Hack N Slash and, depending on the situation, might have a better chance of surviving on a 10+, since she could halve the harm from both opponents. Or she could run. No reason to insist on fighting when you're outnumbered or overpowered.<br/><br/>AW and DW have all those question-asking moves, right? Part of the reason they exist is to help you interrogate the fiction more to figure out what's actually happening and which moves are possible. But even if you don't use the question moves, you still have to interrogate the fiction until you figure out what's actually going on. Can a person Hack N Slash a dragon or multiple enemies at once? Maybe, but we have to examine the fiction closely to see if that makes sense to us. Often times, the answer will probably be "nope."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419474/#Comment_419474" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T16:51:41+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  4:51PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what Jonathan said.

JWalt's description is super helpful, though! That's about as good as you can get.<br/><br/>Don't you find it hard to be <i>consistent</i> with this kind of thing, though? OK, Gwen can roll Defy Danger and if she succeeds, she can just fight one of them at a time, at least for now. (For how long? Until the MC makes a move and decides to change that situation. That could vary a lot, especially if other characters were involved and the turn-taking wasn't so obvious.)<br/><br/>What if she was facing three of them? Four? What if she only had a *short* spear? What if the corridor was slippery? Etc.<br/><br/>I can't put my finger on it, but it seems to me that there's something about the whole model of Player move - MC move - Player move, roll - MC move, the AW conversation, which works against standardisation and against a clear representation of risks. It's much more art than craft.<br/><br/>For instance, if the corridor was slippery, the MC might be inspired to say she falls down ("put someone in a spot") as a Hard Move. However, in a regular, non-slippery corridor, the MC wouldn't say that. She might have them deal damage, instead.<br/><br/>So, what? Now fighting in a slippery corridor is somewhat safer, because you might fall over and delay the death blow by another "turn" in the conversation?<br/><br/>This works really well in AW or Monsterhearts, where the art of handling the conversation and the moves is used to create drama and tension between characters: lots of unpredictable, rapidly snowballing situations. But it seems to me that it's very hard to try to infuse that conversation with elements of consistency and measurable risk: it's resistant to attempts to do so, because that's not what it's designed for.<br/><br/>[Edit: I'm sorry, I'm kind of crossing the two conversations here. I'll copy this in the other thread, please respond there.]<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419482/#Comment_419482" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T17:51:00+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  5:51PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 5:51PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But it seems to me that it's very hard to try to infuse that conversation with elements of consistency and measurable risk: it's resistant to attempts to do so, because that's not what it's designed for.</blockquote>\nYes, I know it seems that way to you. This is a misunderstanding on your part. We've been typing a lot of stuff to help you overcome this misunderstanding, but you keep going back to it like a dog with a bone (now in two threads). Instead of just repeating your misunderstanding, maybe think about how all the things we've said COULD facilitate the type of challenge-based game we're talking about.<br/><br/>I've said it every way I know how.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419484/#Comment_419484" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T18:02:00+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  6:02PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, John (Harper)!

It is hard to be consistent about those threats. And that's actually ok. It's an acquired skill. <br/><br/>You know what else is an acquired skill? Having monsters use appropriate tactics in a game of D&amp;D 4.0 or 3.0. I keep wanting to do things like... Make monsters attack into squares that they don't know about. Or make my zombie horde attack in intelligent convert, and mob the clerics. Or take the player's stats into account even though the monsters might not be able to tell the plate wearing cleric apart from the plate wearing fighter. Or sometimes I want to move into countering the player's usual tactics, even though the enemies don't know what the player's would be doing.<br/><br/>Also, I have this tendency to have my monsters move in perfect concert.<br/><br/>And, over time, I got used to having the monsters use appropriate tactics. I got ready to think of things from the monster's points of view. I got better at doing things faster in ways that the players have more room for different tactics.<br/><br/>And, extrapolating from my time running Apocalypse World, I suspect it's the same thing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
