The premise was a little strange. Similar in concept to the show .Hack, the fantasy content of the game is happening within a video game that that the characters within the game are playing. So, are 4e statistics represent the character we are playing in the game-within-the-game.<br/>\n\tNow, it was explained to me before I made my character that there was some deeply disturbing stuff going on within the game, stuff that was negatively affecting the real world, so that I needed to make sure my character had a good and serious reason to be devoted to the game. By talking with the DM (Garrett), I came up with the idea that my character was a high school girl not likely to play an mmo (or any other video game) but that her younger brother, an obsessive player of the in-game-game, had gone missing and that she decided to go online in order to try to see if any of his (her younger brother's) in game friends had any knowledge of where he might have gone.<br/>\n\tSo the first challenge was making a D&amp;D character. I found this difficult, caring about the character that my character would make for a game within a game was tedious. Eventually  I picked a ready made concept from those provided by 4e that I would not normally be attracted to as a player. I ended up making a Shielding Cleric (from the Divine Powers book) who focused on de-buffs and heals with very little built in attack power. I thought the decision would help me gel with the other players, because my character would be very very heavily focused on support.<br/>\n\tWhat was play like... we pushed through three set piece combats that were long but fun enough, mostly, I think, because I wasn't very involved. It's was like playing monopoly with your family. You don't really care who wins or what happens, you just roll the dice when someone reminds you its your turn and try to pay enough attention not to get completely lost, its fun because you like spending time with your family. That was the D&amp;D game, pick a power, roll a die, something might or might not happen, doesn't really matter. I should note that other players were definitely more invested in the combat, but that was fine too. I don't think I made the game any slower or harder with my level of disinterest, but I guess you would have to ask the other players.<br/>\n\tAfter the set pieces, there was a completely (or nearly completely, there were some meaningless dice rolls made here and there) rules free scene, that was a sort of info-feed with very little in the way of meaningful choice. This was also fun, it allowed the back story bit that I had come up with show up in play and provoked a little bit of in game conversation.<br/>\n\tSo, what did I take away from all of this:<br/>\n\tI never really understood just how bad whiffing could be, in the earlier versions of D&amp;D that I have had a lot more play experience with, I generally avoided characters that had to choose when to use limited resource powers. Rolling to see if your any time attack hits or misses was a reasonable, of rather bland, way of simulating combat, but when failing a roll burns through a resource your attempting to apply tactically, its just (at best) boring or (at worst) maddening. The fact that I didn't care (or at least didn't care very much) made this manageable, but considering I get to do one thing every three to four minutes (of real time), and that there's a 25-50% chance that the thing that I do in that time will be meaningless or effectively meaningless is pretty stupid. There has to be a better way to capitalize on randomness in combat. <br/>\n\t\u2026 also, I am completely done with DM fiat as a valid mode of play. It was hard for me to care about the set piece combats, in part, because I didn't feel empowered, by the GM or the other players to attempt to avoid them, or to do anything except passively participate. A guess I didn't actively try, but that's because I just felt that it would be pointless (that and past experience with this group, if not this game).<br/>\n\tLike I said, though, I did enjoy the experience, if not the game. I like  the concept, I like my character, I like the fiddly combat it theory, but I feel like if I allowed myself to become invested in any of these things, I would get frustrated and quit...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs a little aside: It seems like a lot of the mechanics in D&amp;D don't represent anything beyond game mechanics, and that, again, makes it hard to care about the fictional content: examples from this game: grabbing and thus immobilizing a giant ape and a charge that consisted of running backwards 10 feet and then charging forward over that same 10 feet against an armed opponent, all within the span of some fraction of a six-second round. I want to know what this stuff looks like, and how it works. Is the charge some kind of three stooges move? Was the grab a comic book maneuver where Captain America can Judo flip the Hulk? How does this fit in with the tone of the game in general... not to mention all the complications offered by the \u201cthis is a game within a game\u201d logic, which made me care even less.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291670/#Comment_291670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-05T16:36:33+00:00" title="September  5, 2010  4:36PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2010 4:39PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>You don't really care who wins or what happens, you just roll the dice when someone reminds you its your turn and try to pay enough attention not to get completely lost, its fun because you like spending time with your family.

Why am I here? What's going on? Can I look at the book again? How's it going? Great to meet you, or to see you again. How was your week? And so on.

There's a reason it's a billions-per-year industry, maybe even reaching into the trillions worldwide. People love to gamble even when they feel like shit when they lose. Not just bored, you feel like shit.  And that's with real money, stakes infinitely higher than what we experience in roleplaying games! But if you don't like it, like blondes in porno or ketchup on french fries, you don't like it.  I like everything about gambling except losing real money, so whiffing is not a problem for me - I chose that option out of the many (hopefully) interesting (very hopefully) tactical options at the time and I just couldn't pull the ace, get dealt the 7, roll the 8, and so on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>\u2026 also, I am completely done with DM fiat as a valid mode of play.

You were just figuring things out, my god, if you DID care about those set combats, what if they'd come out wrong through no fault of your own? You'd have hated them even more!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>t seems like a lot of the mechanics in D&amp;D don't represent anything beyond game mechanics, and that, again, makes it hard to care about the fictional content: examples from this game: grabbing and thus immobilizing a giant ape and a charge that consisted of running backwards 10 feet and then charging forward over that same 10 feet against an armed opponent, all within the span of some fraction of a six-second round.

A good group will rarely have a character attempt a Daily power without being set up for it via flanking and/or Aid Another and/or some other form of to-hit buffing, ideally all three.  I quit one group in small part because the players never worked together as a team.<br/><br/>DM and player narration of combat mechanics can go a long way towards making the fictional content seem more vital, for me at least.  Some groups do it, some don't.  One thing I like about 4E is that its powers have nice flavor text which the players can choose to incorporate as a part of their actions descriptions if they are inclined to.  They don't have to be adept at combat/spell action narration; the game text has provided it for them.  Unless the other players seem to find it disruptive, you could ask "What does that look like?" in response to another player's action and model that behavior yourself when you act.<br/><br/>It's hard as a newcomer to a group to ask for things that make the game more fun for you, but you might try talking to the other players about some of the things you'd like to see so that the set-pieces are more interesting for you.  The definition of a set-piece combat means that it is going to happen.  Some DMs are comfortable running things on the fly so that there aren't really any set-pieces but might not be the norm.  A set-piece oriented game can possibly still be fun for you if you can find reasons to care about it; there are player and DM techniques that facilitate this and they can operate independent of what rule set is being employed. <br/><br/>Thanks for posting this, Nolan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291696/#Comment_291696" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-05T21:14:55+00:00" title="September  5, 2010  9:14PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You make it sound like whiffing didn't happen in previous editions of D&amp;D.

I mean, I like gambling, too an extant, but I also need to care on the outcome... One of the strength (I would like to think) that I have a role player is that I actually get a lot of enjoyment out of tension and suffering a long with my character. I would much rather fail a roll in Pendragon or L5R where it means I might be dead or incapacitated for a long time than to fail one in D&amp;D where there are so many back-stops to meaningful failure (or success) that the failed roll doesn't have that kind of oomph. Still, when it comes to tactical games I would rather play Diplomacy than Risk but would really prefer something in between those two extremes (not in terms of complexity or design elegance, just as reference points for randomness).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, on making assumptions about the game/group... I have had a lot of experience with the DM and about half the players in the group and I have a decent amount of experience with 4e, just not as a player, I ran the game for a brief while when it first came out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd describing what your doing in fictional terms is something I deeply am for, its just hard to do in a vacuum (when no one else is doing it) and when your not sure what the rules are suppose to represent or when they rub against your suspension of disbelief (look, when I go diagonal, I go faster).<br/>\n<br/>\nNemomeme<br/>\nI have a hard time seeing the power descriptions as a spring board, they just seem so rigid and specific... I should work on this. I imagine with a little practice I could be more forgiving/adaptive.<br/>\n<br/>\nJdfristrom<br/>\nI didn't mean to say that whiffing didn't happen, I think I noted that I generally avoided limited resource character types... and as for whiffing on a 2-hit roll, that just feels likes in such a different category to me, because its just me doing something that my character can do and failing, it seems like a dramatically viable option, where as, oh, I do this thing that I can only do once a day (once per session?) it seems like that should have guaranteed results from a dramatic point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
