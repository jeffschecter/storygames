For some reason my intuition told me this game would have something to do with the warping of reality, but only now do I think I have the kernel of an idea that I could actually take somewhere. Here are the initial thoughts I wrote down:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic value of a domino is given by the difference between the two numbers. So, a 6 / 5 domino is worth 6 - 5, or 1. Higher difference between numbers = better/more difficult effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo perform non-trivial tasks, players either expend dominoes, in which case they go back into a central pool, or they can lock them in, in which case they go onto the grid in any legal placement in a standard domino game. <br/>\n<br/>\nLocking In : When the first tile is locked in, the sum of the numbers is what counts, rather than the difference. All subsequent numbers must be legal placements according to standard domino rules, but the adjacent tile 'powers up' the one being placed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if there is a  4 / 6 tile and a 6 / 3 tile is placed next to it with the sixes touching, those two sixes combine for 12 before subtracting the 3 for a final value of 9. Since the maximum value from spending is 5 (or 6? I haven't decided what to do with blank tiles yet - whether to count them as 0 or make them special somehow) this means that locking in can be much more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne exception is where a double-tile is added to the grid, so for example a 5 / 5 tile is added to the end of a 3 / 5 one. In this case, all the 5s are added to make 15, and nothing is subtracted. If, subsequently a 5 / 1 tile is added to the 5 / 5, the 5's add together again, but the 1 on the tile being placed is subtracted, for 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nLocking in does have problems, however:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Any locked in tiles do not return to the central pool and so cannot be used again except to power up subsequently locked in tiles. This isn't so bad if you lock in, say, a 6 / 5 tile that would otherwise only be worth 1 and probably nobody will miss, but you may want to reconsider locking in higher value dominoes.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) It is more difficult to legally place a tile than to simply spend it, since the right free spot has to be available on the board. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) In the game, locking in dominoes represents a warping of causality and reality beyond the ordinary bounds of probability. Like a elastic band, though, if you stretch it too far there's always the chance it'll come back and whip you. This is called 'backlash'. I'm not sure what backlash is yet, but it's bad. The chances of backlash greatly increase, the further away from the first locked in tile that the new tile is placed.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nI think this could turn interesting, so I'd be interested in any general thoughts on this initial kernel of an idea I have.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
