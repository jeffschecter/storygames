Both traditional and indie RPGs are being offered in greater quantity and the con is once again earning a reputation of having quality GMs running events.<br/><br/>Players are responding and they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re showing up in larger numbers than they have in years; almost every single scheduled RPG event went off over Gamex weekend and most had alternates signed-up.  Plus, we had a full roster of games on Friday night and Sunday morning and that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s something that I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t seen in many years.<br/><br/>At Gamex, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve started scheduling games starting at 3pm on Friday.  I was the guinea pig on this because I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want ask one of you folks to run and then not have any players show up to your game.  As it was, I had a full table with multiple alternates plus there were a bunch of other folks on Friday afternoon milling about Sign-Up HQ looking for rpgs! That seems like a positive sign to go ahead and schedule more Friday afternoon games for Gateway; to that end, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re looking to add a few more events on Friday afternoon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s 3pm slot.<br/><br/>There were also a fair amount of roleplayers still around on Monday but we had no events offered because traditionally Monday morning has been somewhat quiet for RPGs.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m happy to see that change.  Because of that, this time we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re going to try to schedule a handful of RPG events (like 3 or 4 maximum) for the Monday morning 10AM slot.<br/><br/>As has been the case, you can submit your events directly to our convention website: www.strategicon.net.  The process is easy but if you need to you can also e-mail your submissions directly to Paul or I.<br/><br/>To keep up with our increased attendance, we need more GMs to run events and so we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve come up with a \xe2\u20ac\u0153rewards\xe2\u20ac\x9d program for the upcoming convention as incentive to help us recruit.  If you get a friend to run at least two RPG events at Gateway \xe2\u20ac\u212207, you will earn twenty dealer dollars.  The deal is limited because we only need about another ten GMs so the first of you who can get a friend to register on the website and submit events will earn the dealer dollars (contingent upon the referred GM actually attending the con).<br/><br/>Remember to shoot me an e-mail with the name of the person you are referring.  Keep in mind that the referred GM has to be someone who hasn't gamemastered at the convention before (or at least in a long while); the point of this is to bring in new blood.  If you have any questions, please e-mail me.<br/><br/>On closing, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like to tell you that we really do appreciate your time and effort and we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re continually trying to make your experience as a GM for Strategicon better than ever.  To that end, we're discussing various options and perks.   We want your feedback so please contact us if you have any comments or questions.<br/><br/>I hope to see you at Gateway!<br/><br/> - Denys \xe2\u20ac\u0153Mordred\xe2\u20ac\x9d, RPG Co-Supervisor, noldor (at) gmail (dot) com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82173/#Comment_82173" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T04:29:02+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  4:29AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey west coast lusers, <br/><br/>I want somebody to run The Roach and/or Grey Ranks.
