I have my problems with the con, but I still go each year out of lingering loyalty to my local con.<br/>I don't have any games on the schedule, but I'll be at BASHcon the entire weekend, and I'll be prepared to run pick-up games of Dungeon-World, Fiasco, and/or Dogs in the Vineyard for friends and interested parties.<br/>If anyone's heading to BASHcon next weekend, drop me a post!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
