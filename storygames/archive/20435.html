A piece of paper per major thing the players are interested in, or what I sold the game on. <br/><br/>On the right side of that page, ways to pressure the players (you have offended the duke, you are barred from the Temple, you have been challenged to show your magic is worthy of the court). On the left, desiderata (Elven sword), choices (you could trade your skygem for membership in the Coven of avatars ) and texture (like what the sound of the flute-carved trees is like in the courtyard). <br/><br/>On the back, names, words and pictures. <br/><br/>This is really, really close to AW Fronts, but they're more like lists of moves than lists of Threats. <br/><br/>At the last minute the nervous energy gives me enough of these for the session.

It starts sometime after the last game session, the first moment I am idle enough to daydream. Maybe I'm eating lunch, or I'm at work and there's nothing to do, or I'm in the shower, or I'm driving somewhere, and I start thinking.<br/><br/>Usually I start with imagining how the NPCs are going to be affected by (or even find out about) whatever the PCs just did. What are the NPCs going to do in response? Has what they want changed since the last time I thought about it? Or I'll think about what the PCs are planning to do next, and I'll start workshopping little scenes in my head, different ways things could work out, different places or circumstances that might work. Or I'll see something interesting and cool somewhere and rotate it around in my brain for a while to see if there's a way I could work it into the game. Sometimes I jot down random thoughts in a little notebook I keep for just that purpose.<br/><br/>Basically, I just keep playing the game in my head, freeform, whenever I'm bored.<br/><br/>By the time I actually <i>do</i> sit down and say, "Now I'm going to prep," I've got a bunch of ideas and some random notes built up over the past week or two that I can work with, and it takes maybe fifteen minutes or half an hour to sift out the good ones and make notes that would actually be useful to run the game with. Most of the heavy lifting is already done -- I've got ideas and I've pictured things in my head and I've almost certainly workshopped some dialogue, and out of all of that I just need to get a small list of things specific to the next session that I want to do, and then assemble whatever mechanics or numbers or strategies it's going to take to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449426/#Comment_449426" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-12T04:02:07+00:00" title="November 12, 2015  4:02AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that if you're not enjoying your prep, you're playing the wrong game. System Matters, right? And that applies to your prep as much as anything else.<br/><br/>If a player said, "I love D&amp;D, but I *hate* writing long character backstories. What a chore!" I'm pretty sure the response would be, "Play a different style of game - if you don't like writing backgrounds, then play with a group/game where that's not part of the deal."<br/><br/>I love doing prep for games when:<br/><br/>a) I know the players well enough to be sure they're going to really be excited about what I'm working on, and eager to dig into it. (For instance, if I'm writing up a dungeon map for a D&amp;D group, it doesn't seem like much of a chore since we all know the players are going to be raring to get into there and search every nook and cranny for gold.)<br/><br/>b) There is an element of game or interactivity to it. I adore prepping for games when I have a procedure which takes some player input and my own ideas and spits out emergent material I wouldn't have though of on my own. (Ry, you probably remember when we played Dogs? I had a random table I used to replace my Townspeople with the important Relationships each of you came up with before the game. It was exciting because it forced me to reevaluate a lot of the relationships in the game and was full of surprises. I think my favourite was when I rolled for the young girl the Dog had impregnate six months earlier... and discovered that she was the Sorceress in the Town! Excellent stuff. Wouldn't have had the guts to go with that idea myself, it seems a little too contrived. But I think it made the Town that much more exciting.)<br/><br/>c) My technique for getting lots of a) and b) in my prep is to prompt the players for material, which I have a way of prepping with or around. I leave blanks in my prep and force myself to fill them with material the players bring to me, creating surprises both for me and for them. <br/><br/>My job prepping, then, is more like problem-solving and exploring than just writing lists and memorizing names.<br/><br/>I think another good way is to make your prep into some kind of artistic project. (Interpreting "art" loosely here, as anything which gives you creative satisfaction.)<br/><br/>* Drawing a beautiful map is very satisfying, and presenting it to the players gives you an enthusiastic audience.<br/>* Creating clever handouts is similar.<br/>* Creating a costume or prop for particular NPCs - you can't avoid learning a little more about the NPC in the process.<br/>* If you're a poet, write a short poem about each location or NPC.<br/>* Game design can be part of this, as well: I like to create little mini-games which feed into prep. (For example, instead of coming up with a detailed history and a world, write an Oracle full of elements for a game of In a Wicked Age... - it's a similar process, but more fun because even once your prep is done, there are still lots of surprises in store for you when you get to the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449428/#Comment_449428" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-12T05:45:49+00:00" title="November 12, 2015  5:45AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with AFT and Paul.

I think the reason I do <i>that</i> is that even now -- after 20-odd years of GMing -- it still scares me to think that the players can take the story off in any direction and I'll have to respond on-the-fly.

What are they like? What kind of play do they produce? Can you give some examples?<br/><br/>Maybe those of use without your perspective could use that to come up with some clever solutions or analysis which could help the process.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>"Love letters" are a thing (as far as I know) Vincent Baker invented. You write a "letter" to each PC, which tells them a bit about their current situation, and often asks them to roll some dice. As a result, they are asked to make some choices. The choices lead to a situation in play, as soon as you start the game (the advantage of the "love letter" technique).<br/><br/>For instance, let'say you captured a strange beast of war and have it locked up in a paddock on your farm, but you don't know what it can do, and aren't sure it's secure. The GM might write a letter which says something like: "Dear [character name], you wake up in the middle of the night to incredible noises coming from the paddock, and it sounds like all the animals on the farm are screaming into the night sky. You've made some preparations against the Beast getting loose, but how good were they? Roll your Cunning Preparations skill. On a success, choose one from the list below. On a failure, choose 2; on a really bad failure, choose 3:<br/><br/>* The Beast is loose and running off into the forest.<br/>* One of your servants/allies (to be chosen randomly) has been slaughtered by the Beast.<br/>* The paddock and enclosure is ruined, and the Beast (if it is still here) will have to kept here by force.<br/>* The Beast has manifested a frightening and unexpected ability to spread a frightening disease.<br/>* The Beast has manifested a frightening and unexpected ability for large-scale destruction.<br/>* All the other animals are either dying or fleeing from the farm.<br/><br/>You can see how, no matter what happens, at the beginning of the session there will a tense and exciting event, but you, as the GM, don't have full control over it. There will be a surprise for you as well, and (given a couple of love letters), more than enough material for the session.<br/><br/>It's just one technique, of course - who knows, maybe that's even more stressful than whatever you usually do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip" title="The Bunyip"><img alt="The Bunyip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/758/nIGUP7BK8UEFU.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip">The Bunyip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449512/#Comment_449512" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-15T22:34:51+00:00" title="November 15, 2015 10:34PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul.

It's a wish-list of sorts.<br/>For the <i>real</i> prep for an ongoing campaign, I list a series of questions for the players, such as what does it look like, what's her name, things like that. I let them flesh out the world. Then I write a hook, and note down a series of names of NPC's (drawn randomly, but consistently across sessions so established NPC's don't suddenly change) along with a table of descriptors, of which there are always three assigned. In my experience, three identifiers is enough to make a character memorable. Two will be physical, one mental, such as "the bearded young wizard in the red robe" (I don't consider gender or job a descriptor, though, technically, they are).<br/><br/>For one-shots, it depends on the game. I tend to only run one-shots written for fastaval, and those are single complete games, completely self contained. How I prep for them, other than reading the material, depends on what's required of me as a gm. I had one game where I had to play a single consistent npc who was present in every scene, cut scenes, start the next scene (scenes were pre-written) and direct the players all at once. It was rather exhausting, to put it mildly. In the opposite corner I had a game where I had to set the scene, hand out characters, and send a text messsage every half hour. That was it. Other than that, sit quietly in a corner.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449523/#Comment_449523" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-16T10:39:10+00:00" title="November 16, 2015 10:39AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good way to get started on campaign prep is to ask the players after each session "What are you looking forward to in the next session?

I do prepare love letter style "session opener" moves, but that's more of the 1/4 of what I'm going for that works well enough without too much torture.  But my high standards even for that make it stressful:<br/><br/>When it comes down to building the list of pressures including the session opener, I want them to:<br/><br/>1. move play forward without knowing which way it will necessarily go<br/>2. push the players' buttons based on their expressions so far<br/>3. feel natural to the campaign world, with accompanying texture<br/>4. have good 'pairings' - like accompanying events or options that the players also care about, add an extra dimension (worst example but all I can think of: Not just a street fight, a street fight where a few donkey carts have knocked over and there's apples and confused donkeys all over the place) <br/><br/>but also...<br/><br/>5. Provide the background texture that will support me if things head off in a different direction<br/><br/>I end up trying to do 1-4 on a scale that would also help with 5.   But I end up with love letters that hit 1-3, fail at 4, and totally fail on 5.

An obvious example would be a character who is desperate to have his vengeance against the Empire, and another with a Key of Mercy or Compassion or something like that.<br/><br/>A web of those is enough to create memorable characters who have something to talk about.<br/><br/>I then "cut" up characters into three different "pieces", allowing players to combine them to create different characters every time you play.<br/><br/>2) Love-letter-style introductions.<br/><br/>Each character has a "love letter" which instructs them to make a roll, choose options, and answer questions. Things like, "Which other character was once your suitor? How do you feel about them now?" Also things like, "You believe the Cult has something you need. What is it?"<br/><br/>These create a starting situation as well as some background information (as in the examples above).<br/><br/>Oh, I also have a fun NPC-creation piece:<br/><br/>I have a (short) list of important NPCs, and a list of "reputations". The players take turns assigning the "reputations" to the NPCs. Every time I play I have an Imperial commander, for instance, but sometimes he could be a coward and a cannibal, and other times he could be a ruthless but honourable killer. These are really fun! (Since they are just "reputations", I always have the option of surprising the players with some kind of revealed persona contrary to reputation, but so far that's never been necessary.<br/><br/>The rest of the hack is mechanical stuff; not really important to this thread.<br/><br/>(If anyone wants to see it, let me know and I could try to clean it up and post it in another thread. But the "prep" I used to make the scenario is very effective and fun, as well as replayable if desired.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449531/#Comment_449531" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-16T19:44:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2015  7:44PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, that's interesting!  As much as I have sometimes struggled to prep good puzzles and balanced encounters, I would have no trouble at all prepping your 1-5.  One of the parts of prep that's most fun for me is world-creating or world-imagining, and I inevitably do some of that before beginning a campaign.  Once I know what the setting is like and am eager to express it, that expression inevitably comes out in donkey carts and background texture, with no specific prep required.  <br/><br/>If I were to attempt to systematize this for your goals, I'd write a list of bangs, with the first half being Sorcerer-style player character crises and the second half being evocative events that express what I like about the setting.  Then I'd call on that list as needed in play.<br/><br/>If coming up with my own world stuff were problematic, I'd use a sourcebook.  If it had nice tables, I'd use them, and if it didn't, I'd simply read the book and jot down whatever strikes me as cool from it in a bangs-style list.<br/><br/>Does any of that sound more manageable than what you've been doing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449534/#Comment_449534" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-16T21:41:32+00:00" title="November 16, 2015  9:41PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also look for ways that allow you to prep the same content, but are more fun.

I'd find myself writing down a bunch of crap that I didn't need and not writing down the one or two things that I actually did, all because I had weird ideas about what prepwork entailed that had nothing to do with how I was running a game. I'd write up a lot of detailed background information that was fun to think about but didn't really have any immediate relevance to what the PCs were doing (or could reasonably be expected to discover, let alone be remotely interested in), for example. I wasn't thinking about anyone's goals in the next game session (not mine, not the players'), I wasn't thinking about where I might get bogged down and would find it useful to have some stats or rules written down in advance so I wouldn't have to look them up on the fly, I wasn't even thinking about how long the session would probably go or what would make good stopping points along the way.<br/><br/>Once I started really paying attention to what I needed to run the next game session instead of flailing around prepping all kinds of things 'just in case,' things got better for everyone. And hell, if you're in doubt whether you'll need a thing, don't prep it. If you're right, you just saved yourself some pointless busywork, and if you're wrong, it's not the end of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449539/#Comment_449539" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-17T01:12:08+00:00" title="November 17, 2015  1:12AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take some pictures but what I ran with is so comparatively dopey looking.

But eventually I got burned out as a GM playing this style, so badly that I started looking for GMless / GMfull games or mechanics that I could apply that could help me get the same feeling in the campaign with less prep.<br/><br/>Years later I kinda gave up feeling that while such games were quite interesting, the feeling and atmosphere we got from them wasn't any close to what we wanted to play as a group. I then came back to good terms with doing some nice prep for certain games, and improvising the hell out of some others.<br/><br/>For my (finally finished) <b>Offline rpg</b> I outlined a series of procedures that make prep a quite enjoyable and quick brainstorm. It ended up being 8 questions that the players and narrator get to answer as a group. They also roll a few dice to see how good/bad are the situations proposed by them. Like on the last playtesting, where players wanted the economy of their kingdom be based on brothels, but they rolled a 1 for it, meaning they had the worst ones in the world righ now (because they were populated now by undead). <br/><br/>That made the necromancer they created as a threat into the Necropimp, <i>but that's another story</i>.<br/><br/>In Offline, once the setting is defined, the narrator has about 2/3 of the prep done. He rolls then a couple of dice over the map. one indicates where the adventure starts, the other the current destination. The numbers inform about how dangerous is the place, so on a six at the place where the adventure begins, the PCs are escaping from something related to the main threat or the main threat itself. if it's at the end, they are actually going to confront it. If both numbers are low, then the danger is somewhere in the road. <br/><br/>The rest comes from checking the character's sheet that should be done by then (characters are built using 5 fate-like aspects, related to 2 or 3 main character concepts like race and one or two professions, but the skills are totally player defined.) and that's it. Since the conflict resolution mechanic is basically PbtA, it's reaaally quick and nice to improvise with it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449556/#Comment_449556" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-17T20:04:25+00:00" title="November 17, 2015  8:04PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2015 8:05PM by WarriorMonk.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Otoh (and sorry for the double-post) when I read 5e final version it was love at first sight, but immediately I knew I couldn't improvise a D&amp;D campaign just like that. I had to do proper prep. But then again, I wasn't going back to railroading until the players came up with something better, so I came up with something in the middle. Here's my advice on this:<br/><br/>a) For almost all GMs there's a part of the prep that is enjoyable and one that not, or at least not so much. Simplify, prep in advance, randomize or handwave the one you hate the most. For me, it's the numbers and rules I hate, so I had to study my a$$ off of the rulebook, make monster cards to have them handy and avoid bookflipping in middle-session, download an app to handle the spells and some other unavoidable stuff. I did some random tables and lists for merchants and that was most of it. From time to time I still study the corebook before a session, even the parts I'm already familiar with, just to see if I find something new.<br/><br/>Dungeon crafting is also a chore that can be randomized. I haven't found an online randomizer that suits me so I made my own, complete with trap randomizer. I like it so much that it even allows me to improvise dungeons on the run, but of course, you get better effects prepping it in advance; Tony Dowler's How to host a dungeon is one of my favorites at that.<br/><br/>Even the NPCs and adventures can be randomized. You just need to find some system/randomizer you're comfortable with. For me it's usually enough with my own old <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">resourcefull deck</a><br/><br/>b) Brainstorm the heck of it if you can. Just having one person who isn't stressed by prep and telling them what happened on the last session may give you ideas of what to come up next with. I helped countless times a friend of mine to dress his next session or add some twists here and there. Players still have issues with him about his way of directing the game, but always end up coming back.<br/><br/>c) Plan backwards instead of planning ahead. As anybody I always have a general idea of what could be a good place to guide the campaign to, but more often I find the best inspiration thinking about the things the players have left behind. Think on the actual consequences of their actions and push them forward until they reach them. What about that monster that escaped last time? And that town they liberated, did it got better or worse? That pitiful goblin they didn't found should have leveled up and have reasons to chase after them now, right? And what if he found an ally like that other monster they fought and though it was dead? Even if players don't remember, it's often fun and more interesting to have motivated enemies, npc's and monsters that have seen the PCs fight and know a few things of what they are capable of.<br/><br/>d) Random concept art. It works wonders for me, as I'm totally a visual person. May work for you too, give it a try: just google up "concept art" anywhere and you will get a lot of interesting places, characters, monsters and even equipment ans scenes you would like to try. Of course, I more or less keep things ready to be used anywhere, like someone posted above, instead of railroading players into that scene in particular.<br/><br/>e) Ask the players! Also a favorite of mine, and you can even keep it somewhat "in character" and avoid players pushing too far with a simple procedure. For example, PCs go into a bar. I give them freedom to make up what kind of legends myths, threats and treasure they heard about there, but then I get to define how much of that is true. I even use the same procedure to create the setting in my D&amp;D campaign that I do when GMing <i>Offline</i> but again, I get to say how much of it is true. I often do so by letting players roll for it, since it feels more fair. Of course, players never get to arrive to the place described the same session they find out about it, so that gives me until the next session to prepare, but also gives me some direction.<br/><br/>f) Control your perfectionism. When prep feels like a torture it's probably because you're putting too much effort into it. Stop it. You're not writing a classic, you don't need to be prepared for all the things they may or may not do. They won't care if the bad guy has a story or not, for all they know it's there for them to kill it. They won't stop to hear his speech if they can go straight to kill it. They won't mind if he was right in the end after they kill it. <br/><br/>The magic actually happens in the session, not before. My take now is that if I need an enemy, I use it as it is on the monster manual and ONLY if the dice are good and keep it alive, I start giving it features. A hobgoblin survived two spells from the cleric; NOW you notice it has the symbol of an evil deity tattooed on his chest. A bugbear killed one PC and captured another; the next time they find him he's taking a bath and speaking like a noble. That's it, now they are a bit more interesting and it's the things they have done that give them importance, not anything I could have come up with before that the players may or may not find out before they fight them. Of course, it pays off to have some features, names and other things prepared to use them with any character when the opportunity arrives. Again, you can't wing everything, but you don't have to prepare for precise, predefined situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449557/#Comment_449557" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-17T20:28:41+00:00" title="November 17, 2015  8:28PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My torture is the small bits.

For me, the practical limit of perfection is the speed and accuracy of the reader/spectator's comprehension. I noticed this first as an artist: due to the methods of reproduction I use for my comics and the size I publish them at, I realized that there was a threshold beyond which details weren't reproduced. So even when working on a A3 page, scanning at 1200 dpi for resolution, details that were clear for me in the original became fuzzy or even disappeared on the reproduction.<br/><br/>In the end, It was enough to hint at the details instead of rendering them completely, scanning at 600 DPI and even working the original at half the size. Later I found it was more or less the same with the game. Players pick up pieces of information, their own brains reconstruct the whole deal in a different way and there's all sort of noise mixed with the information you're delivering them that you would be surprised of how far their versions of the story could fall apart.<br/><br/>Though you're right about  using evocative descriptions. The more emotional, the more chances there are that the players remember that detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449562/#Comment_449562" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T01:42:20+00:00" title="November 18, 2015  1:42AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             So here's my prep   <br/><br/><a href="https://db.tt/kmSppHWB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://db.tt/kmSppHWB</a><br/><br/> The pictures of pages that have lots of stuff in them  are examples of when I successfully tortured myself into having everything done. <br/><br/> The ones with lots of gaps or where I tortured myself but didn't have enough time and I ended up kind of faking it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449564/#Comment_449564" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T03:10:49+00:00" title="November 18, 2015  3:10AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, another way to put it is in trying to get a ghost/echo (sans layout) per session. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449568/#Comment_449568" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T12:00:01+00:00" title="November 18, 2015 12:00PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Ry">@Ry</a>, which game are you playing?

The other 3/4 of the prep is about the consequences that the players actions will bring.<br/><br/>Yet I loosely based the campaign on the mines of phandelver module, mostly out of insecurity; it was my first time DMing D&amp;D at all, so if I didn't used a module, I'd probably end up with a few more pages. The way I'd like to do it, I'd have one page for each "front" in the game that I'd had to actualize each session or two. Maybe a couple of phrases, but nonetheless, I'd probably spent more than one hour on the whole deal, separated in different moments along the time I get between sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449587/#Comment_449587" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T23:08:31+00:00" title="November 18, 2015 11:08PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2015 11:10PM by Ry.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449588/#Comment_449588" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T23:10:11+00:00" title="November 18, 2015 11:10PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game is an AW derivative, if that helps.

The prep in advance only exists to make sure that stuff is consistent, interesting, and remains relevant.  Although I don't get the feeling that anything is disposable in this game.  All the players have to go on has come through play, so it's got to remain consistent, and consistently interesting.  <br/><br/>But I have a really strong commitment to the players to provide the texture and internal consistency of this world.

I've got to be able to generate the sense that the universe is full of stuff, and that we're discovering it, even if I do that based on lists of 100 things and I do it in the moment.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449603/#Comment_449603" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-19T19:57:31+00:00" title="November 19, 2015  7:57PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, did my world color bangs idea sound worth trying?

I must warn you: doing that is what got me burned as a GM before; but if you're better than me at handling that stress and get that extra time to work without pressures, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>The best advice I can give you is to try to improvise more, not to change you way of GMing nor as a replacement for prep, but in order to gain more confidence  to make things on the run, like that extra detail you crave for but don't have enough time to add in your prep.<br/><br/>And if you can find another GM that can help you, brainstorm stuff together. You just need to be clear about the limits of what the other person can add and what not, and maybe roll a dice for inspiration or when both of you aren't sure about something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449606/#Comment_449606" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-19T20:53:59+00:00" title="November 19, 2015  8:53PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One of the parts of prep that's most fun for me is world-creating or world-imagining, and I inevitably do some of that before beginning a campaign.  Once I know what the setting is like and am eager to express it, that expression inevitably comes out in donkey carts and background texture, with no specific prep required.  </blockquote> So, I do that, but it's hard to do on a tight schedule... i.e. "Get that world imagined quicker, man!"\n<blockquote>If I were to attempt to systematize this for your goals, I'd write a list of bangs, with the first half being Sorcerer-style player character crises and the second half being evocative events that express what I like about the setting.  Then I'd call on that list as needed in play.</blockquote>You see that's basically what I'm trying to evolve it towards... bangs = pressures on the right-hand side of the page.  Other interesting stuff = desiderata, sensations, and options on the left.  <br/><br/>But yeah, I end up staring hard at that empty, divided page.  <br/><br/>\n<blockquote>If coming up with my own world stuff were problematic, I'd use a sourcebook.  If it had nice tables, I'd use them, and if it didn't, I'd simply read the book and jot down whatever strikes me as cool from it in a bangs-style list</blockquote>I do frequently visit my wall and come back empty-handed, because I get caught up at the point where I'm like "OK, I need something I can convert into a dinner party for a bunch of decadent alien species that all think differently but coexist in this city... they need to be somewhat racist towards humans and there needs to be ways for the players to advance their agenda during the thing even though they'll just be servers... and I don't want to pre-judge what hte players will decide their agenda is..." and then nothing in my gaming collection helps and I go back to staring at that blank page.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449607/#Comment_449607" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-19T21:02:31+00:00" title="November 19, 2015  9:02PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2015 9:04PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's what happens to me when I aim for an over-specific goal.  Phrasing "other interesting stuff" as "world color bangs" was my attempt (I dunno how successful) to get away from that.  I think with a long enough list of just "stuff that I think is neat", there's hope that I can make it fit in the moment.<br/><br/>So, like, dinner with decadent aliens that think they're better than humans -- the first things that pop into my head are:<br/>- An invitation that assaults human senses -- a blinding card that thunders words into your skull and then deducts a "tip" to help cover the service by siphoning off a millileter of your spinal fluid<br/>- "brain food" that stimulates parts of the brain that in humans cause hallucinations but in "advanced" aliens just aid focus and perception<br/>- a human ex-con servant with a collar<br/>- live art, some sort of naked painting thing<br/>- periods of meditative silence between meal courses<br/><br/>If I brought that list to the session, then who knows which one I'd wind up using, but I'd expect to get some utility out of it, and even if not, my mental vision of the aliens is now clearer than it was when I started writing

part to the players. Trying to figure out how was the game going to be played and preparing for all the possible options is what got me burned. My first bad reaction then was to subtly railroad enough to reduce the player options, in order to limit the amount of prep needed. Yes, I got great scenes, amazing twists and lots of detail, but eventually, I still got burned out. <br/><br/>At least then I was lucky enough my GMing didn't ruined the game, because I ended up relying on the player's ideas more and doing the prep based on what they wanted to do instead of basing it on what I foreshadowed/imagined they would do.<br/><br/>Now, it looks like you're still in control, your case and my case might still be different, but I can't help but worry you may be walking down the same path I did. <br/><br/>I went the opposite way and tried going full impro, no prep, GMless games. It didn't made the trick but wasn't a bad experience in itself. I learned a lot about what things could be improvised and what couldn't. Now I'm successfully applying that experience on full prep games; I mean, at least I'm not stressing too much about it and I know that in the worst case I can still improvise a good enough session with minimal prep and make wonders when I get enough time/inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449615/#Comment_449615" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-19T22:34:58+00:00" title="November 19, 2015 10:34PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2015 10:36PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry,<br/><br/>Now that you've actually described your game, I can see why it's such a challenge. You've placed an enormous burden on yourself, and, if you have limited time, it may be a nearly impossible challenge. <br/><br/>Your example in your last post is particular painful: as a few people have said, it sounds like you're not only placing a burden of originality, consistency, and brilliance on yourself, but you're also trying to provide a very specific experience instead of "going with the flow" or listening to the players.<br/><br/>Surely bringing down the stress or torture on your part is worth a very tiny reduction in the quality of the game? (I can't imagine it would be that much of a difference, you're a very quick improviser and constantly full of ideas - I'm not even sure why you think the players could tell the difference.)<br/><br/>Maybe some more examples of how the prep makes the game work and how not doing it makes the game fail would be helpful?<br/><br/>That said, *my* approach would be to try to find more indirect ways of preparing, so that the material I create can be used and re-used, and doubles as other forms of information (I'm learning about the world as I "prep").<br/><br/>In other words, try to create <i>principles</i> rather than specifics, and tools that allow you to transform the principles into specifics at the table. Sometimes I think of these as <i>themes</i>, as well.<br/><br/>Dave's "colour bangs" are a great example of that. Do you remember a technique someone here came up with for representing foreign cultures in an RPG? The short form was that you outlined a basic tenet of a culture, and then you rolled for how it manifested in any particular character or scene.<br/><br/>For instance, going with Dave's example, you could have an alien culture with the theme "Complete lack of empathy towards humans". In play, when you need to know something about this, you roll on a table like so:<br/><br/>1d6<br/>1 - This theme is exagerrated beyond the norms of this culture.<br/>2-3 - This theme is followed, without much care.<br/>4 - This theme is followed, with great reverence and/or consistency.<br/>5 - This theme is not followed - an exception to the rule.<br/>6 - This theme is actively subverted (perhaps a form of rebellion).<br/><br/>So you come up with a handful of themes (probably three would be enough), and, in play, you lean on them when you need a creative jolt.<br/><br/>For instance, an alien is walking down the street with a human servant. They players ask for more detail about the servant. You have nothing prepped, so you decide it's a good opportunity to showcase this theme ("lack of empathy towards humans") and roll a d6. It comes up with a 1, so you narrate a collar around the neck of an underfed human in desperate need of medical attention, and maybe the alien is yelling at them on top of that. If you rolled a 5, perhaps they are friends, and the human is well-dressed, but other aliens eye them suspiciously as they walk down the street and mutter behind their proboscises.<br/><br/>I had some other tools along these lines (some even player-prepped, without them *knowing* anything about the world/game - "what do you fear?", "what is your greatest hope?") in my Apocalypse: Emergence hack. You can't use the "what do you remember about this?" aspect of those rules, but the personal possessions and themes could really work for you. (<a href="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/61182571/Apocalypse_Emergence.pdf" rel="nofollow">Link here</a>.)<br/><br/>Questions like "what scares you most about this?", or "what are you hoping to find there?" can be great tools which allow you to mine player creativity without necessarily assuming they know anything about the world. (And if you want more objectivity, you could always roll one of those "yes, but", "no, and"-type dice before you tell them what's actually there.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449616/#Comment_449616" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-19T22:39:37+00:00" title="November 19, 2015 10:39PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2015 10:43PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add: I found the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7789/generating-culturally-rich-npcs/p1" rel="nofollow">thread</a> I was thinking of!<br/><br/>I wrote a similar article a long time ago (it has been taken down, so I can't link to it), about "improvisational themes", which were abstract combinations of descriptions and values. For example, "That which is clean and orderly is dangerous; that which is dirty and unkempt is safe."<br/><br/>In play, you can access the theme in either direction: you happen to catch yourself describing a certain place as orderly and recently cleaned, so you inject an element of danger, or you know an NPC is safe, so you improvise some details about his unkempt appearance.<br/><br/>Over time, these can generate a sense in the player that things are "fitting", even though they almost certainly won't pick up on the actual theme. It gives you a means to improvise with consistency.<br/><br/>(My particular example was partially inspired by Star Wars, in this case.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449620/#Comment_449620" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-20T01:20:12+00:00" title="November 20, 2015  1:20AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> - when I'm GMing there is a lot coming at me (emotional reading of and attention level of each player plus fictional circumstances plus rules).

Bangs - as I used to understand them at least - give me the burden of being clever, and also of being so "in advance": preparing a bag of tricks and waiting for a perfect moment to deploy them, knowing most of them are to be disposed of\u2026 This feels disingenuous to me: it distracts me from experiencing the game in the moment and has me reference my prep instead, to check whether it fits \u2014 like those D&amp;D players who keep scanning their character sheet, looking for a power or item capable of magically solving their current situation instead of paying attention to the situation itself.<br/>It helped me, instead, to reframe this either in terms of MC moves (AW) or in terms of "just playing" the NPCs, who have their own agendas and are entangled with the PCs in a web (Sorcerer). Note these are effectively the same as driving with bangs, everything else being equal, but framing it one of these ways makes it more effortless on me. First thing, I'm not trying to be clever - I'm just doing my job, and reacting, and events keep snowballing (I really like that metaphor). And I only referencing my prep sheets when I forget something, when I need to check out something, or when everybody's looking at me intently - otherwise, I'm just using my moves/playing my characters reflexively.<br/>In terms of prep-time, a set of MC moves is mostly static through a campaign, though you do introduce new moves as part of prepping new threats, and these are the most concrete, vivid moves. Preparing a cast of NPCs can take a while before the first session, but then it sort of takes care of itself, in that any changes to your prepped materials happen during play, not in-between sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449630/#Comment_449630" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-20T08:07:02+00:00" title="November 20, 2015  8:07AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The torture part is how to turn great idea X into bangs and switches, bells, and blinking lights.</blockquote>What's the habit you're trying to replace?

A Red Hand of Doom kind of game results. That was great in years past \u2026 and they were SO FUN. But I don't enjoy them anymore. <br/><br/> This game has to get away from that - the player characters have to choose what they are going to care about in the midst of intense pressure. They come into the world highly competent but still facing a basic and obvious problem: How to survive in hostile terrain populated by alien creatures. <br/><br/>But what happens next is what I really care about. Given that you're surviving, what do you do? What will you decide to care about, and if you care, how much? What will you trade away, give up on, or stand by against the external world? Those moments where the players hesitate - not because they don't have enough to work with, but because they're in the moment, they can see that they've got everything they need to make a choice, but no one but them will absolve them of that choice or bust down the door to make it obvious. Those are my favorite so far.<br/><br/> But I also like that this is happening in more colourful sets and that along the way the players had little choices and resources along the way, and that the pressures have a lot of variety.   That meant that when the  the bigger moment comes it wasn't inevitable - it's just life.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449638/#Comment_449638" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-20T12:59:12+00:00" title="November 20, 2015 12:59PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2015 1:24PM by AsIf.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds to me like you actually have a rather specific set of criteria in mind, and as such, it needs to be supported by infrastructure or mechanics.

Ok, certainly, I've not seen a procedure exactly as you would like, but perhaps we can help you build one. <br/><br/>Among similar useful things that I recall are Pathfinder's and 5e D&amp;D tables for creating adventures, on the gamemastering book of the former and the DM manual of the latter. The useful part there is the one that helps you randomize NPCs and create moral dilemmas. But basically you'll need to establish every character as a mix of good and bad intentions/habits/prejudices.<br/><br/>I dunno if a list of emotions (well, you got about 8) paired with a list of things that could convey those emotions would help. Certainly, things like Tarot and maybe Pathfinder's Harrow Deck might be out of question, since those are more about theme than actual detail.<br/><br/>The thing that makes it hard for me to make something actually useful to you, is that I'm used to random tables and procedures that give me a trigger to kickstart my imagination into filling the gaps, while it looks like what you need is something that helps you fill specific gaps that appear clearly to you once you identify the main problem. So, until I can wrap my brain around your method for filling those gaps I can't help but shoot ideas blindly, sorry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449650/#Comment_449650" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-20T20:53:56+00:00" title="November 20, 2015  8:53PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm looking at Richards Fish tank and I like the concept, because I can see it grow organically and my brain can deal with that and it looks clear on paper.<br/>The problem appears when you up the detail to the level of story section 4. <br/><br/><b>4.

Too much things in your head and lack of sleep tend to kill daydreaming a lot. My line of work, as a comic creator, still helps me a lot to induce myself into daydreaming at times, but the effect is more powerful when it comes naturally.<br/><br/>OTOH, I probably have something else wrong in my head, I tend to daydream even when listening to something or someone interesting.
