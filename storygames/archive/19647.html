He's done this at about half a dozen conventions so far, and apparently it roughly doubles the revenue at the cost of what amounts to a moderate discount to the customers. Well worth it for direct sales, I understand.<br/><br/>A couple weeks ago Jim floated the idea that he's itching to do a crowdfunding campaign for a new paper book as pay-what-you-want. I was initially rather skeptical about the math of the matter; the Internet can be a cruel mistress, and it can be difficult to predict when 4chan or some such Internet jury decides to make an example of you. What if you just end up printing thousands of books at your own expense for assholes who want free swag, or who just want to see you squirm?<br/><br/>Jim's not exactly one to listen to the voice of reason, so <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/no-salvation-for-witches-a-pay-what-you-want-book" rel="nofollow">now he's started this crowdfunding drive with Rafael Chandler</a>: a goal of 5,000 \u20ac, no contribution levels, and every contributor gets the book at the end. There are fortunately certain mathematical constraints that work to make it very unlikely that they'll go bust with this experiment. For instance, consider these points:<br/><b>*</b> Jim's not actually selling books, he's selling 100% discount coupons for books in his webstore. This means that the contributors will still have to pay postage for the books if they want a paper copy. (PDF you get regardless, of course.) That's an effective bottom on the unit price at which you can get the book, as even if you were to contribute a close-to-zero amount of money into the campaign, you'd still have to pay the 5 \u20ac or whatever to have the book shipped.<br/><b>*</b> Each contributor only gets one copy of the book. Not that you couldn't get around this with shenanigans if you wanted, but at least trolling Jim here isn't as simple as clicking a button.<br/><b>*</b> The actual profit of this enterprise basically comes in the form of a lowered unit price for the books: even if Jim ends up selling the first 500 or 1,000 units at a harsh discount, he'll still benefit in that he can use his own money to extend the print run and then make money by selling the cheap units later, via distribution and long tail direct sales. From this perspective it's not that important for him to get a good profit margin from the initial crowdfunding project, as long as it pays for those first 500-1,000 books; thanks to the way set-up costs for printing work, those are the most expensive books to print, after all <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Anyway, I've been following Jim's antics with pay-what-you-want, and I'm curious about what others think regarding this business model: why is it working, will it work in the long term, and could it work on a larger scale? What are the limits here? Economic armchair theory would seem to indicate that this can't be an universally successful sales strategy due to the way it loses pricing information (the customer has to rely on competition to get a sense for what the appropriate price is), but one has to admit that it seems to be working for Jim here and now. Should I be planning to throw myself to the mercies of the customer base in this same way with my next project?<br/><br/>It occurs to me that this approach might work for rpg products as well as it does because of the specific traits that rpgs have as products, in comparison to some other things one might sell. For example, rpgs are luxury products (the demand is elastic, people only buy them for want, not need), and the competing products are generally not directly comparable, and the customers have at least a little bit of social investment in the producers. Toilet paper, for comparison's sake, has none of those qualities - could a paper factory sell toilet paper as a pay-what-you-want product? Crazy thought. Why does pay-what-you-want work at all?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436363/#Comment_436363" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T10:11:16+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 10:11AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 10:14AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you hit a few of the most pertinent points.  Another is the tight-knit nature of the RPG community; there is not that much difference between a "hobbyist" and a "pro" in our world.  There's also a blurry line between a "designer" and a "GM".  So we are rewarding our own sisters and brothers when we download their games and pay for them.  It feels good.  <br/><br/>Lastly, there's just plain loving an artist's art, and wanting to show your appreciation for them.  When Radiohead released "In Rainbows" under a PWYW model, being a fan, I paid the same full amount that I would have paid in a music store.  I loved knowing that they were getting 100% of that money, instead of the measly cut they would have got if they went through through traditional distribution channels.  I felt HAPPY that I was helping to feed Thom's kids, helping Jonny to buy new guitar strings, etc.  They deserve the money FAR more than any record industry executive.  Again, it feels good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436365/#Comment_436365" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T10:44:52+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 10:44AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had this theory that eventually some new model of supporting artists who produce easily copyable art will eventually emerge that do not depend on everyone paying some minimal amount. If the artist produces stuff people like, my assumption is that some dedicated following (which might be a very small group) will contribute enough to keep the artist producing. A huge mass of folks who barely appreciate the work and perhaps just like to "collect" will get the work for almost nothing.<br/><br/>Now I guess an interesting thing is if that can include almost nothing distribution of physical copies (print or CD or whatever).<br/><br/>On the flip side, I wonder how our economy will survive the hackers. <br/><br/>A hacker COULD cause Jim problems if they hacked enough accounts to make fake orders and charges (and maybe actually cause Jim some financial pain when a bunch of the hacked folks attempt to reverse the charges for the order they didn't place, before everyone figures out it's a fraud - but not sure, Jim as seller might still not get paid, while the hacked "buyers" get their money back).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436368/#Comment_436368" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T10:52:05+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 10:52AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 10:52AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah <a href="/forums/profile/ffilz">@ffilz</a> I have wondered about that possibility too.

What I want to pay is zero. What I want them to receive is infinite. The two clash and confuse me.<br/><br/>Which of the two models is closest to what Raggi's doing, I don't know.

With crowdfunding it basically becomes "collect X amount of money and I shall release this thing free into the wild". I personally find the ransom model and similar patronage arrangements pretty credible as a solution to the future of the culture industry in a world where information wants to be free.<br/><br/>The pay what you want thing, when applied to digital product, is sort of an itemized version of the ransom model: it's still patronage, except instead of asking for money to release the thing, you ask for money each time somebody downloads it. The ransom model is economically pretty clear in that I can understand the incentives; with pay what you want the incentive scheme is more nebulous, as you're basically requiring the customer to put a price tag on their own decency. I wonder, would more extensive use of pay what you want continue to scale elegantly, or would the customer base start reacting to it in some different way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436372/#Comment_436372" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T11:14:00+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 11:14AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And yes, Sandra hits the nail in the head - I have similar problems understanding the pay what you want proposition on a gut level - unlike the Ransom model, which works in terms of game theory, pay what you want only seems to work insofar as the players are gripped by a social mythology that encourages them to pay instead of merely taking for free.<br/><br/>I should note that this social myth thing totally works for me if you set up for peer pressure: make the list of contributors public, and collect contributions from a cohesive community, and I think you'll find the number of shirkers to be quite low. In this regard pay what you want seems rather unproblematic as a solution for e.g. covering a club picnic's expenses.<br/><br/>Yet regardless, at least so far the pay what you want experiments seem to have been successful in the Internet: I haven't heard Ben Lehman (who's been doing this for a while now) complain, and Jim seems happy and eager to get deeper with it.

This apparently-simple material question can invoke a complex of internal questions about self-esteem, capitalism, relative suffering, the practical value of what is essentially a luxury item, etc...  Publishing the work under a PWYW model allows the artist to step clear of that whole complex of issues, taking a load off their mind (and leaving the question in the hands of the audience).

I don't know what to think about their situation, so I'm forced to think about my own, and act accordingly.<br/><br/>So really, the best strategy for someone trying to sell me a thing via PWYW is to <i>tell me how much they need to break even.</i> If making that product or shipping it or licensing it or whatever cost them money, then I want to know that. It sets an absolute minimum for the price I'll pay, and encourages me to scale the actual amount I'll pay up to the point where they'll get at least a little bit of profit out of it.

I can see several reasons why this works, and I guess I'm trying to map out different kinds of buyers here.<br/><br/><b>Patronage.</b> I think PWYW only works up until the creator has been burned. Sitting on conventions with PWYW gives you control to put a stop to it if you're seeing that the model spins out of control. The consumer also sees the face of the creator, which makes it more honest. The consumer probably realize this, and pays so the creator can produce even more stuff.<br/><br/><b>Pay what you can afford.</b> I downloaded a lot of games, music and movies when I was a student. Today, I pay for Spotify every month, I pay for indie games (I bought FTL after I downloaded and finished it), I give money in F2P games because I want to support the developer, but I still download movies. I can afford what I pay for now.<br/><br/><b>Pay to see what it is.</b> Sometimes, something catches your eyes and out of curiosity you buy the pig in the poke. I don't know how many times I've been burned, but with PWYW I can pay what I feel I can invest in it.\n<blockquote>And yes, Sandra hits the nail in the head</blockquote>\nAs a sidenote. I got a general dislike to people using the real names instead of the usernames AND doesn't quote. I usually have no idea what you're talking about when doing that. I think it's bad manners to force someone else to backtrack just to keep up with the conversation.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436443/#Comment_436443" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T08:15:54+00:00" title="August  5, 2014  8:15AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2014 8:26AM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am Sandra!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436445/#Comment_436445" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T08:28:51+00:00" title="August  5, 2014  8:28AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2014 8:29AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra.

If a product was priced at $1-10 then suddenly there's a fair metric for the consumer and a guaranteed bottom line for the seller.<br/><br/>Myself, I love PYWYW because it cuts down piracy (or does it just legalize it? Hmmmm). Also, I'm one of those people that pays reasonable prices when I buy PYWYW. But the weird thing is, my price is always dictated by <i>how much I think I'll use it</i>, not what I think it's <i>worth</i> in general. If I'm curious about a game's mechanics but don't think I'll ever play it, I may throw down $2-5. If I think I'll actually play it regularly, that price goes up significantly. It has nothing to do with the product, the creator, or the suggested price. <br/><br/>So there's one issue with PYWYW instead of sliding scale, right there. Or maybe it's a benefit, depending on who you're talking to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436474/#Comment_436474" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T12:01:46+00:00" title="August  5, 2014 12:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is quite a bait and switch to refuse to indicate a minimum price, and then guilt-trip those who pay too little, isn't it? One would think that either you indicate a price scale, or you take it courteously when people take advantage of your offer. They weren't planning to buy into a character assassination when they under-paid you, after all, so it's not very fair to complain after the fact about any minimal payments.<br/><br/>One issue with all negotiable pricing strategies, PWYW included, is that there's no particular reason for a customer to know better how much they should/would pay for the thing - they aren't as familiar with the product as the seller, after all. Assuming that a customer wants to actually pay according to their perceived value, then what makes the most sense for them would be to first take the product for free, explore it, and then pay afterwards as an informed decision. I suppose that the main reason for why this sort of thing wouldn't work is that PWYW actually relies quite a bit on social convention to get people to pay - too many people would presumably not pay if the payment was due a month after receiving the product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436475/#Comment_436475" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T12:06:48+00:00" title="August  5, 2014 12:06PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, unfortunately drivethru's model doesn't support "play before you pay".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436476/#Comment_436476" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T12:12:06+00:00" title="August  5, 2014 12:12PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, unfortunately drivethru's model doesn't support "play before you pay".</blockquote>\nCan't you re-purchase it later?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436477/#Comment_436477" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T12:12:11+00:00" title="August  5, 2014 12:12PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2014 12:12PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tod, doesn't it?
