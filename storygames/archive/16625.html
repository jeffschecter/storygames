After 30+ hours, we've already hit our goal and are now working toward our first stretch goal!<br/><br/>Our Last Best Hope is tabletop roleplaying game for three (3) to five (5) players that takes about two hours to play. During the game, you and your friends will play through a classic avoid-the-disaster movie, like <i>Sunshine, Deep Impact, The Core,</i> or <i>Armageddon</i>, where your characters are the stars. Each game is unique, as your group confronts a new Crisis with a new set of characters and a new plan to save the Earth. <br/><br/>Our Last Best Hope is a GM-less, prepless game inspired by roleplaying classics like <i>Fiasco</i> and <i>Polaris</i>, designed to be played as a one-shot epic game that will leave your gaming group with incredible stories.<br/><br/>At our first stretch goal, we plan to release an Our Last Best Hope Expansion Book that will include additional Missions, hacks for the game (such as a <i>2012</i> disaster movie hack), and advice about making the most of the game. <br/><br/>Please come by and check it out!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380366/#Comment_380366" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T14:51:31+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  2:51PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bravo on your quick turnaround and fast funding!

It seems like a remarkably fast turn-around from its original date of conception to a publication drive (less than two months), which leaves me feeling leery about its development process. How many times has the game been playtested? How many of those playtests were blind (done without any of the authors present or participating)?<br/><br/>2.) What has the development process consisted of, from the end of Game Chef to the present day?<br/><br/>3.) Why are you choosing to do a Kickstarter fundraising campaign for it? What will the money go towards?<br/><br/>4.) What will the production schedule be? Do you have estimated timelines for finishing the text, finishing the book, finishing any expansions that get stretch-goal'd, and shipping out products?<br/><br/>5.) What's your favourite experience so far with the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380397/#Comment_380397" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T22:35:54+00:00" title="May 31, 2012 10:35PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Blazmo">@Blazmo</a> - Thanks!  I've been really lucky that my school schedule was light post-Game Chef; I've been able to put a lot more time into this project than I usually have room for in my schedule. As you might guess, I'm incredibly excited about this game. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">@Mcdaldno</a> - These are great questions. Here are a few (long-winded) thoughts:<br/><br/>As I said above, I've been really blessed this last two months with a surplus of "gaming" time. My school schedule wrapped up right after Game Chef ended, and I've been able to essentially work full time on the project, running regular playtests with both experienced and beginner gamers. The early playtests were exciting but really rocky; things improved a lot when I transitioned the game to a GM-less model. Like with most games, some elements have survived the process untouched and other elements were axed after first contact with the players. <br/><br/>In general, my development process for <i>Our Last Best Hope</i> is the same as it was for <i>The Play's The Thing</i>: I've run playtests, evaluated the feedback, made changes to the material, and returned to the gaming table for a new playtest. I see the whole process as iterative and repeated. I'm trying to zero in on a ruleset that best fits the setting, or in this case, the genre.<br/><br/>As for Kickstarter, we really loved the community we built with <i>The Play's The Thing</i>. We got incredible feedback about the game, and heard from our backers repeatedly about what they thought was working (or not working). For us, Kickstarter is more than just a way to raise money for a game; it's also a way to gauge how much interest there is in a product and a way to build community around an idea. <br/><br/>The money raised from the Kickstarter will go toward paying for professional editing, layout, and printing, as well as fulfilling the backer rewards we've promised. Magpie Games is blessed to have really strong in-house resources for art, but a lot of the other elements that make up a professional product are still way outside our budget without Kickstarter. In addition, we love being able to offer fun rewards like patches and flash drives because they really expand what "publishing a game" means to our fans.<br/><br/>Given that my "real-life" summer schedule will be much lighter than normal, I hope to finish the text by the end of the month, finalize the layout by late July, and send the core book and rewards to backers shortly after. The expansions will obviously be on a later schedule, as we haven't started working on those elements at all yet. I think we can deliver the Expansion Book/short fiction before the end of 2012 (if we hit $6,000/$10,000). <br/><br/>My favorite experience with the game happened in a playtest about two weeks ago. Each of the players gets a "death card" at the start of each game. If the player can arrange to die according to the card, he or she will add a few dice to the final roll of the game, essentially helping the survivors save Humanity by dying heroically. <br/><br/>In this particular playtest, the crew had picked up the complication "running out of food" near the end of the game and one of the players stunned everyone by playing his death card "Death...by your own hand." He narrated how the rest of us found him with a note that said "Finish the mission." He saved the crew, but he wouldn't be joining us on the rest of the journey. It was kind of a magic moment, a time when the mechanics of the game supported and encouraged the player to match the genre of the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380404/#Comment_380404" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T02:17:32+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  2:17AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2012 2:18AM by Graham.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I share Joe's doubts.

It's not a finished game. The Kickstarter is about trying to find out if people want me to finish it, much as Will Hindmarch used Kickstarter for Always / Never / Now. I've got a lot of ideas I want to work on, and I don't want to waste my time working on a game that nobody wants to play. Now that I know that this is a game people want, I'm ready to dedicate the time over the next few months to produce an awesome game.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a> - My apologies!  I thought I had answered the question in my post above, but I totally didn't. Sorry also that it too me so long to respond; I was at Origins with limited internet access and time.<br/><br/>I haven't kept a precise record of playtests, but my rough estimate is that we have playtested the game about fifteen to twenty times. Unlike The Play's The Thing, which had a simple mechanic that I was able to test and refine in just a few playtests, I've found that Our Last Best Hope really struggled for the first five to ten playtests. After about a dozen times playing the game, the current "No GM" model really gelled, and I was able to refine it into the game I demoed at Origins. <br/><br/>At Games on Demand, I think I ran about a half-a-dozen demos of the game. I'd love for anyone that played to pipe  in here and let people know what you thought of the game!<br/><br/>I have not done any blind playtesting. It's something I know I should do more of, but I get nervous about sending out any document that isn't a final copy with the proper layout. I'm going to try to overcome that fear and send out a document this week for people to try out. In fact, if anyone on here wants to give it a try, I'd be happy to include them!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380724/#Comment_380724" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T12:12:55+00:00" title="June  4, 2012 12:12PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mark,<br/>you're being a really good sport about this. kudos to you.

Jim maybe?), and another walk-in player (whose name I also cannot remember).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe elected to go down rather than up, so instead of a space mission, we ended up going into the center of the Earth, channeling our inner Jules Verne. Our mission was to stop the steady buildup of uranium that was developing in the core which threatened to wipe out the planet from the inside; we were uniquely qualified to do so since we were somehow resistant to the gamma waves given off by the isotopes (although, as the story progressed, it turned out we each had other reasons for coming too, even knowing it was probably a suicide mission).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur crew:<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Xavier (Me), Engineer; to borrow a phrase, "Genius billionaire playboy philanthropist". I owned a massive tech firm and built the machine we were now riding toward the Earth's core.<br/>\nDr. Tom Ramirez (Mark), Doctor; he was the mission leader, and all-around straight man.<br/>\nSGT Stevens (Victor), Soldier; military presence on the boat (I frequently found myself calling it a boat, despite any lack of similarity thereof), since the mission was sortied by the government.<br/>\nZhenya Kolostovsky (walk-in), Scientist; nuclear physicist, lauded as an expert in her field. Natural choice for a mission like this.<br/>\nDr. Carson Masters, I think (the other GM), Scientist; geologist, also a very tenured expert in his field, and brought along for said expertise. Came out of retirement even in his late years just for this mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't bore you with all the details of the game, but I have to say that for a game that "isn't finished" it hits some <i>really</i> high notes. The way the game moved around the table and allowed everyone some level of participation at almost every turn was superb, and the dice added the right amount of tension for the whole thing to just create this escalating sense of doom as things start to go wrong and there seems to be precious little we can do to stop it. Character deaths are an important part of the system, and the story we had created made perfect avenues for some absolutely amazing dramatic scenes. The game was very emotionally charged which made everything feel compelling and like you were actually a part of the scene, rather than just an observer as Fiasco results tend to leave me feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as I got home I spammed every social network and email loop I could with info about the game. I want everyone I know to play this and it will probably be hard for me to go back to just Fiasco.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've got something great here, Mark. I can't wait to see more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vjwyatt" title="vjwyatt"><img alt="vjwyatt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii93/burner2501/faceyourmanga032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vjwyatt">vjwyatt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381071/#Comment_381071" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T17:02:37+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  5:02PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah! Hell yeah! Mark's game rocks! <br><br>Jim Crocker was the one playing Dr. Carson Masters.

I don't know how many playtests or what kind of data Mark had gotten through the process of fine tuning this game but it was very smooth for being done is such a short time. I don't have any concerns about how fast a game is made. I just want to test it for myself.

It seemed superfluous. As the harm points climb the players feel the stress. There's no need for the character to feel it. At least not in the form it is now. That's all I had any problems with.<br><br>As for Mark's project timelines I am not concerned. He pulled off an excellent play based game called The Play's the Thing. It came out pretty sweet. I'm also not concerned with stretch goals. When I back something I don't back it for what I might get. I back it for what is in the backer categories that are already defined. I could jump on a Kickstarter that hits 500% funded and have no stretch goals and I would still be happy. A new game exists and I got what I asked for by helping.<br><br>Victor                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381100/#Comment_381100" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T21:51:16+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  9:51PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Nullzone">@Nullzone</a> - Thank you!  That session really showed off what the game can do; it was one of my favorite experiences of the whole convention. I'm glad you enjoyed it as well.<br><br><a href="/forums/profile/Victor">@Victor</a> - Thanks, man. It does look like we will be cutting the stress portion of the rules and leaving them as an optional ruleset for the Expansion/Companion book.
