One of the great misunderstanding of Ron's discussion of Lines and Veils in Sex &amp; Sorcery was that these were things that you should hammer out in advance with your play group like some kind of contract written in blood.  I think that's socially problematic because it creates fictional trenches in the name of social safety rather than actual understanding of each other's lines.  What Ron was getting at was that these things *exist*.  People have lines.  Some creative material gets veiled.<br/><br/>When you go into a social situation knowing these things exist then you can *discover* them rather organically.  Someone introduces some fictional content and someone else gets a little squicky about it.  You know you're walking near a line for that person.  The question is when that happens what do you do?<br/><br/>For No One Gets Hurt, you back away.  You revise your content.  You throw a veil over something and quickly move on.  You introduce new content that quickly moves play away from the line.<br/><br/>For I Will Not Abandon You, you keep going.  You acknowledge that you're crossing a line but you also trust the other player to handle it.  The other player plays through the uncomfortable content with you.<br/><br/>These are reciprocal relationships.  If they don't check out for your material, you don't check out for theirs.  These also apply to oneself.  You might find yourself cornered by the fiction and you realize you're about to do something that makes *yourself* uncomfortable.  For No One Gets Hurt, you rationalize a way out of doing that.  In I Will Not Abandon You, you go there and trust the group to play through it with you.<br/><br/>For whatever reason whenever I talk about this stuff people liken it to therapy.  That's not what it is.  It's about emotional and creative integrity to the demands of the fiction and about appreciating the social honesty of that fiction.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328054/#Comment_328054" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T14:40:17+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  2:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 2:42PM by renatoram.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically, it means "this game might touch some dark, sensitive, painful stuff (for you): we promise that we'll be there with you, nobody will make fun of it, and we'll deal with it together". <br/><br/>"nobody gets hurt" instead says "all at the table can and should feel comfortable to say that some theme/situation/whatever is not ok and will be ok to veil it or avoid it"<br/><br/>Am I off?<br/><br/>--edit--<br/>I've been thoroughly Jesse'd <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328055/#Comment_328055" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T14:42:50+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  2:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a duality.

We play the game, we know the game might go there, and we're prepared for it if it does.<br/><br/>Theoretically there's another option, which is that we seek out the painful stuff, that we look for where it's uncomfortable, and we go there on purpose. I know someone has a thing about family relationships, that messed up family dynamics are a powerful but also painful emotional trigger for her, so I make sure to bring messed up family dynamics into the game.<br/><br/>I know I have brought things into a game because I knew that one of the other players found that kind of situation particularly emotionally difficult.

I remember reading this horrible story on RPG.net about how a guy ran a Firefly game that involved the crew transporting a guy who turned out to be a dealer in forced child prostitution.  Any time the players tried to do anything about it the GM reminded them that if this guy failed to arrive at his destination an inter-galactic war would break out or something like that.  Basically, he just subjected to them to moral helplessness for four hours.<br/><br/>That isn't edgy, that's abuse.<br/><br/>The premise is fine but if the players want to kill the guy and deal with the inter-galactic war then that's what they should be allowed to do.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328083/#Comment_328083" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T16:39:43+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  4:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jesse">@Jesse</a>:<br/>Or, depending on how much player authority the game provides, they might have been able to come up with a clever Door <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> response, perhaps involving the impending war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328084/#Comment_328084" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T16:57:16+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  4:57PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I remember To The Pain but I'm not sure I buy it.

There was closeness through the topics, but afterwards friendships became hard.  Friendships complicated by revelations directly created in a role-playing game.

Do you want to create emotionally difficult fiction with your friends?  And then to touch on Vincent's point, can we create mechanics with emotionally difficult content in mind?<br/><br/>If at any point you personally say, "No" then that's fine.

But 'emotionally difficult fiction' is a pretty broad term.  I mean, i could say yes, no, and maybe, and 'i don't know' to that question.<br/><br/>In my life i've come to the personal conclusion that emotionally challenging art is easier for me to deal with by looking at the intentions of the artist.  It's not a perfect solution, and it's certainly not a universally applicable key.  But basically i say, "is this person challenging something that makes me uncomfortable because they want me to grow?  Or are they trying to explain something to me that's just personally hard for me to get?  Will my empathy to the concept make me better at loving/understanding them?  Do they want me to be better or uplifted from my discomfort?  Or are they just trying to be different for sake of being different?  Are they just trying to be sensational for attention?"<br/><br/>I guess, what i would ask, is...well, "When does our consensus really need to trump one person's vision? Which challenging ideas are really more valuable than our feelings?"  And also, What are the ramifications of pulling people through emotionally painful experiences?  Art, especially in RPGs, does an amazing thing by offering us a sort of hyper-experience through fabricated reality.  It takes from us time and experience that is real, and gives us in return something beautifully unreal and worth the trade.  At what point is using our imagination to create emotionally dangerous situations a worthy trade off?<br/><br/>I can say only this right now:  i wish i'd played safer with certain people in my past.

Jesse, that's high praise from you, since <a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Play Passionately</a> is totally the foundation of, like, everything I'm pursuing in roleplaying right now.<br/><br/>So, Jenskot, as you can see from the above links, I'm enthusiastically exploring the space of I Will Not Abandon You right now, in play and design. I definitely use it as a rallying cry, but it's also baked into my rules, because that's how Rallyed I am. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm using it as a way to make space for uncomfortable material in games, where said material will be fruitful for building powerfully moving art together.<br/><br/>So the way <i>The Dreaming Crucible</i> makes that space is, first: it <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/i-will-not-abandon-you/" rel="nofollow">names I Will Not Abandon You explicitly as the mode of play</a>. Then it gives some guiding principles for the group's social and creative interaction: <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/principles-of-play/" rel="nofollow">Say What You See, Live in the Moment, Lift One Another Up</a>. Then the players generate the material for play by each choosing a Seed for, respectively, the Heroine, Nemesis and Companion. These provide a starting image for the characters that the players flesh out. The Heroine/Hero seeds all imply trauma, like <i>"A boy throws rocks against a shed as hard as he can, his bruises still throbbing and starting to purple,"</i> or <i>"A girl sits in the passenger seat of a car, dreading the return of her uncle from the liquor store."</i> And finally, during play, the players vie for control of aspects of the characters--the Heroine's Gift and Flaw, the Nemesis' Powers, etc--and who will ultimately transform each aspect: will "Heart full of anger" mature into "passionate defender" or "bitter and spiteful"?<br/><br/>All these elements work in concert to push play into uncomfortable, emotionally affecting places. But the key element is the agreement, that invitation to enter dangerous places together. Looking each other in the eye and saying "I Will Not Abandon You" is a significant and powerful social act, and doing just that creates more trust than some groups have over the course of years of play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I Will Not Abandon You is, in my experience, about how you deal with triggering or squicky or painful stuff<i>if it comes up</i>, but there's an assumption that no one is<i>trying</i>to make you feel squicky or triggered or in pain. We play the game, we know the game might go there, and we're prepared for it if it does.</blockquote>\nWell, Simon, actually, I see pushing toward uncomfortable material as a core component of IWNAY play and design. There's a spectrum, surely--Bacchanal's injunction to always narrate something that's uncomfortable to share resides at one end, where I'm sure plenty of games happily occupy the "don't push for it but it might go there" category. To really be IWNAY, though, I think there needs to be SOME degree of push toward the uncomfortable. Making it too easy to avoid pain might be IWNAY in name but functionally will really be NGW 99% of the time. Many games that facilitate IWNAY (mine included) take an approach of pushing hard, to varying degrees (Bliss Stage pushes harder than Crucible, for instance) toward uncomfortable material coming up, without actually requiring it.<br/><br/>That said, going in with an explicit agreement to bravely face painful moments together <i>does</i> increase the chances of play going there, I think. And you don't have to FORCE play into the triggering places, surely. Generally, being true to the integrity of your fiction is quite sufficient.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329193/#Comment_329193" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T21:04:08+00:00" title="June 11, 2011  9:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew,<br/><br/>I read this (below) with some fascination:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: graypawn</cite>It seems so simple, when i think of it now, because the turn of phrase should be the answer.  But in retrospect i'm still a bit stunned to admit that a lot of the negative emotions i've got toward the IWNAY games i've played were not due to the material covered, but the estrangement that followed.  There was closeness through the topics, but afterwards friendships became hard.  Friendships complicated by revelations directly created in a role-playing game.  About faiths, desires, and the impressions we had of each other.<br/><br/>And so i've sorta twisted "I Will Not Abandon You," to a point, when i hear it now, it almost sounds like "This Is Why I'll Abandon You."

I'm new to this concept and Story Games in general, but I have questions for the hard-core IWNAY rally-ers, like Joel. <br/><br/>Should you state your lines ahead of time so they can be more easily crossed? (Is this likely to lead to people sand-bagging their stated lines?)<br/><br/>What if someone's lines are just boring to you? Should you push them just for <i>schadenfreude</i>?<br/><br/>Joel, did we get anywhere near that in our Dreaming Crucible game? I feel like we stayed in a pretty comfortable area. I was really pleased with the outcome. If you had your druthers, how would you have pushed us? How do you push strangers without just getting as gross as possible as fast as possible?<br/><br/>(This last bit might be better addressed in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14437&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow">Actual Play</a> .

Not off topic at all, I'd say!<br/><br/>So, no, we didn't get very near my personal comfort zone in that game, but we DID build our game around pretty sensitive material: A 10 year old getting beaten black and blue for standing up to the boyfriend that was beating his mom!. And then his mom yells at <i>him</i> for it! This is what I mean about pushing play <i>toward</i> uncomfortable places without necessarily <i>requiring</i> that it go there. The violence visited on young Derek could very well have been triggering for other players. The fact that we were all pretty comfortable doesn't take away from that. And honestly, if the violence had been any more explicit and "on camera," I probably <i>would</i> have been uncomfortable.<br/><br/>You're right that when you play with strangers you're not going to always know where people's comfort zones lie. I think that's fine. I haven't tried it, but my instinct says that stating your lines up-front is likely to <i>either</i> lead to soft-balling those issues ("oh, John is uncomfortable with incest, so even though it's totally legit to go there, I'll just be nice and avoid that direction.") or to pushing those boundaries in a too-hard, artificial fashion. ("Oh, Mary's freaked out by rape? Well BAM! out of the alley jumps a rapist!") So far, for my game, just stating up-front that play can go to painful places seems to serve OK. At that point, it's the exploration of the material and gameplay that uncover those places. I mean, "bruises still throbbing and still starting to purple?" Yeah, I guarantee you can think right now of a good 3-5 things that could mean, none of them pleasant. Leaning on the "sensitive material" issue any harder than that would sort of break the bubble.<br/><br/>And that's one of the main tools the Crucible provides, for strangers OR friends, for discovering the dangerous territory you'll be exploring. The heroine choosing this or that Seed is making a default statement, "I'd like to be challenged HERE," without having to say bluntly, "Hello everyone, today I'd like to play a game to work through my personal issues with physical abuse." And if she picks a Seed that doesn't really push buttons for her? Her prerogative, and no one's gonna force her to lower her guard. But the game does at least provide an <i>invitation</i> to do so. And even if she plays it safe with the Seed, the other players are granted permission to push hard on her through the rest of play.<br/><br/>Another example: Apocalypse World pushes for IWNAY play: the book has a "Mature" rating, and the MC's duties include "making everyone human" while "looking at NPCs through crosshairs," which means humanity is precious but life is cheap. Play thus leads toward stories of people in desperate, brutal circumstances striving and suffering, including families, children etc. And of course each PC has a Special move, which basically says "here are the social consequences of having sex.<br/><br/>It's possible to play AW close to the bone in relation to these issues, like I did awhile back. But it's also possible to play it pretty casually, without a lot of empathy (in character or out) for the suffering NPCs, avoiding the sex moves altogether, etc. and it's quite possible to play Apocalypse World IWNAY style without hitting every uncomfortable area that play might go. the game simply provides tools that point you in certain, emotionally affecting directions, and the rest is up to you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm still working out these issues and techniques for myself--as delighted as I am to see I Will Not Abandon You thrust to the forefront of Story-Games' attention, please bear in mind that I don't have any definitive answers. just field reports from my own explorations, still in progress. I would love, for example, to hear more of others' techniques for IWNAY. Like, what does "play through the issue" look like? So far in my play it's meant simply "our voices, facial expressions and body language may indicate that we're experiencing some rough emotions, but we'll just keep playing without mentioning it, and probably discuss it after the game to decompress." Which is OK, but does anyone have advice, techniques or rituals for acknowledging emotional distress mid-play without breaking flow or bursting that bubble of emotional investment in the fiction?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329213/#Comment_329213" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T23:38:01+00:00" title="June 11, 2011 11:38PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good stuff, Joel.

Someone introduces some fictional content and someone else gets a little squicky about it.  You know you're walking near a line for that person.  The question is when that happens what do you do?<br/><br/>For No One Gets Hurt, you back away.  You revise your content.  You throw a veil over something and quickly move on.  You introduce new content that quickly moves play away from the line.<br/><br/>For I Will Not Abandon You, you keep going.  You acknowledge that you're crossing a line but you also trust the other player to handle it.  The other player plays through the uncomfortable content with you.</blockquote>\nThis would make it seems IWNAY a personal choice. But it's not. Or, at least, it can't be a choice from only one person at the table. That would <b>not</b> be IWNAY by definition, it would be <b>abuse</b>.<br/><br/>IWNAY is a characteristic of the Social Contract (in big model terms), everybody must be (more or less) on the same page about this (even if they don't talk about it)<br/><br/>So, if someone draw a line or a veil...  you listen to him. Even in IWNAY play. Because it does mean that (1) that was really too much for him, even if he/she was prepared to play IWNAY, or (2) you don't have the same expectations about the game, not everybody is playing like you. (and in this case Nobody Gets Hurt is the safe fall-back choice until the question can be discussed together.. or not,  maybe you simply play IWNAY another time without that player)<br/><br/>IWNAY is a group thing. It doesn't mean that you don't respect other people's explicit lines and veils. It does mean that everybody at the table is on the same page (or at least around there) about trying to push their normal line and veil WITHOUT calling them. It does not mean "break other people's lines and veils", it foes mean "I am trying to push <b>MY OWN</b> lines and veils, help me doing that, and don't abandon me instead"<br/><br/>(I consider the use of Lines and Veils - you could call them "safewords" if you want - even more important in IWNAY play.  If a game is built about NGH, usually you have the means to stop any material you don't want at the table even without using safewords)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329312/#Comment_329312" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T22:32:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2011 10:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>This would make it seems IWNAY a personal choice.

There's one in particular that stands out the most, but it's kind of a tale that doesn't stop at play-experience, it treads into needing further explanation of me, and reveals a lot about my faith, my personal take on altruism and pacifism, and my very close relationship with a guy i knew through college and a few years after, his marriage, our roles in the game and the group of friends that made the game...it's all juxtaposed in a very sad and beautiful jewel that i wish the King of the Underground would mine from my head <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ...<br/><br/>So i'm iffy about telling it (definitely here since it would very much meander off topic) but i will say this:  my friend and i had both never heard of IWNAY or NGH.  We were just young, passionate gamers, and we wanted to play through a tale that really gripped our hearts.  With a great deal of ignorance i hedged a lot of the relationships of our 'characters' to mimic our own interconnectedness as friends.  It worked very well, people began to play their characters among each other the way we hung out in real life.  Our characters became more like avatars, and their relationships eased into an intimacy that was cinematic, and in that hollywood way sort of promised happy endings.  Promises that were never spoken, but i think were assumed between each other in real life, as well.<br/><br/>Then i drew a line in the sand, pretending like it was an 'in game choice,' nothing more than a divider in the path of a simple story.  It resulted in a character scene that became a real live shouting match in my friends dorm room.  It ended, to me, when my friend came to my house the night i was putting all my stuff into my car, the night before i drove away forever.  He tried to make amends, i tried to make amends, i believe we really did.  But we failed.  He hugged me, soaked my shoulder in tears, and left.  I did the same, feeling like my heart was a stone.  The next morning i got in my car, and very thoroughly <i>abandoned</i> my friends in that city.  I think Everybody Got Hurt.<br/><br/>We never played the last session of that game.  I wrote a long, gaudy story for my own ends that served as an epilogue (and therapy).  But the game was just a White Wolf hack.  It told us everything about how to shoot each other and nothing about how to handle the truth about other people in the game with us.  We knew who went first in combat, but we didn't know how to react when we found out what things came first in our beliefs.<br/><br/>Defining a mental state before you play is great.  But in my mind it's only a first step.  What comes next?  Oh, jeez.  I have no idea.  But it needs to be talked about.  It's a huge, huge thing.  What is <i>I Will Not Abandon You?</i> <b>It's admitting that sharing a story or experience can shape who you are by realizing the shape of those you love.</b>  Story Games are <i>powerful</i> in that fact, being a blend of sharing and experiencing that sometimes borders on magic.<br/><br/>I think we need a thread about how to really deliver on the phrases "I Will Not Abandon You" and "Nobody Gets Hurt."  We could define it forever, but what are we going to <i>do</i> with it?<br/><br/>[edit: apologizing for writing what should probably be blog post, will be short-winded from here on.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329818/#Comment_329818" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T21:59:59+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  9:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't have much time to post right now, but...thank you so much for sharing that, Drew.
