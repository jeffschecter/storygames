Was it getting out of the habit of looking? Did the game go in a direction they weren't so interested in? Was it just too much work? I've been involved in a number of play by forum games, I can't remember one that has run its course to the end. I can't help thinking that there must be a way to fix that and I have an idea that it might be linked to getting expectations set correctly right at the beginning. I can't think of a better group of people to poll for more information.<br/><br/>I'm about to look at trying to run a postal game of De Profundis again (this is third time lucky) and think I've got a method that is going to work but it's possible that some of the reponses here could feed in to that.<br/><br/><br/>First topic creation, so if this is in the wrong place....                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404502/#Comment_404502" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T04:13:00+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  4:13AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's sad, isn't it?

And it's easy to leave your response until later, then forget about it.<br/><br/>And part of it is about social cues. If I'm not getting into a tabletop game, I still have to say something: it's hard to walk away.

The others stand around waiting for him, but then eventualy start back up, however with much less frequency then before. The habit of play has been broken.<br/><br/>Then, games often seem to get stuck in an unexciting place, and neither the players nor the GM seem willing to get it going again. I once joined into the middle of a Twilight 2000 PbP game, and in six months of real time the players never did anything but talk listlessly about where they might go next.<br/><br/>Lastly, from time to time players will leave a game. If you don't have a matching stream of people joining, then the game eventualy will be dead.<br/><br/>However, none of these are things the GM can't handle.<br/><br/>Most importantly a GM should keep to a posting schedule, and if everyone has not posted yet, do the GM's turn anyway. This keeps the game exciting for the players that are there and keeps the flow going.<br/><br/>A GM should break the game into explict chapters and scenes. This lets small and large stories constantly be achieving closure. By explictly ending individual scenes when they have crested, the GM can keep the game from dragging. It is also easier for new players to come into the game since they don't have to fit everything that's ever been written before into their heads - they just have to worry about this scene. And finally the end of chapters give players a graceful, not disruptive place to leave when they need to. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404511/#Comment_404511" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T07:01:35+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  7:01AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes a lot of sense, thinking of the games I've been in that have failed the goal of the game has always been quite grand, if specified at all. Even the Duty &amp; Honour games that I played were trying to do a whole mission straight away and it seems what could be done in 4 hours at the table is actually a major undertaking with play by forum.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I'm interested specifically with the Quiet Year game is that when it started it looked like it should have overcome the vast majority of stumbling blocks (not that it's died in the way others I've seen have). So I'm wondering if looking at the whys and wherefores of it might come up with some useful lessons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404522/#Comment_404522" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T08:33:36+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  8:33AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Synchronous gaming - face to face or online - forces you to pay an up front cost.  On Monday night, I'm going to spend three hours with these guys.  You can't half-ass it, at least from an attendance perspective.  Either you're there and so you might as well participate, or you have to explicitly decide, "I'd rather just stay home and watch Dexter."  Synchronous games don't happen until the play group is at least willing to make that initial investment, so your players are at least vetted for that.<br/><br/>Play by post, on the other hand, has a very low barrier to entry.  You can sign up with as little as a few minutes to spare on an irregular basis.  As a result, participants with extremely low motivation/determination levels can participate, because they're <i>not forced to give anything up</i>.<br/><br/>It's easy to procrastinate - you can always do your turn "later".  This is impossible with a synchronous session - either you're there at the appointed time, or you miss it entirely.<br/><br/>The other thing is that participation has a positive feedback loop.  If we're all posting like clockwork, it's great.  If the GM is late a day or two, well, it sends the message that this is okay; next thing you know, a few other are a day or two late as well.  Since nobody actually wasted a three-hour face-to-face session with nobody showing up, everyone can pretend the game 'might come back' for along time, because nobody actually has to pronounce the time of death.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404523/#Comment_404523" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T08:33:59+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  8:33AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2013 8:34AM by Fuseboy.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (double post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adtidi" title="adtidi"><img alt="adtidi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adtidi">adtidi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404528/#Comment_404528" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T09:30:34+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  9:30AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with the points raised above.<br/><br/>Personally for the The Quiet Year thread I had a week when I didn't have chance to check the thread and the action had moved on. Didn't want to post anything new until I'd caught up. I guess this is something that increasingly hinders new players from joining as the game goes on.<br/><br/>Speaking generally forum games don't generate the same positive feedback that playing face-to-face or synchronously online does. You don't know what reaction or emotion your post has gained unless another player explicitly states it. In synchronous you have the bonus of visual reaction to your input, such as a laugh or a frown. <br/><br/>Forum play can be riskier than playing synchronously. Composing a post takes longer than conversation, and you're not necessarily getting the same positive feedback rewards (if any).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404531/#Comment_404531" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T09:55:05+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  9:55AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2013 9:56AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about this a lot too. I think there is certainly a "life happens" element, but I also think it's often used as the excuse, rather than being the actual reason. Call me cynical, but I see a number of reasons why PbF games fail.<br/><br/>- Gamers often use PbF games as a stand-in for real life games. They have the itch to get a role-playing session going, but for whatever reason, they can't make it happen, so they use PbF games to fill the void...but they're slow paced so you never get to scratch that itch while it's still itchy. After two or three weeks, having barely hit the surface of the adventure, they just get bored of it and lose interest. Many gamers have a little bit of ADHD when it comes to what they're excited about.<br/><br/>- One of the things that used to be a turn-off to me was the long, drawn out posts from certain players. Some people really like the writing aspect of PbF, and often see it as a built-in group of people to read their short fiction or an opportunity to flex their creative writing muscles. Personally, I enjoy the interactivity, so long flashbacks and dream sequences and drawn out in-character thoughts quickly tire me out. I much prefer frequent, shorter posts with more back and forth.<br/><br/>- Most of the time when you start PbF, it's with a bunch of random pick up gamers. If you've played a few online MMO's, you know what a PUG is. They're hit or miss, and a lot of the time you'll get people fighting for the spotlight. They'll butt heads in character, but you can tell by the tone of their writing that they're really frustrated as players. Sometimes that can be dealt with on the social level, but it's one thing to deal with your friends butting heads, but mediating for random internet people can be difficult to impossible.<br/><br/>- They're tiring on the GM. It's like managing a department. You've got to provide a lot content over long periods of time. It just gets old over a few months.<br/><br/>- Internet anonymity makes it much easier to just walk away and disappear. It's not like they ever have to speak to the other players again in most cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404554/#Comment_404554" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T13:00:40+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  1:00PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find PbF games inherently frustrating and confusing, so my interest always drops off fast.<br/><br/>It's got to do with asynchronous (time) play, I think. If I'm in GAME MODE I want to post like crazy, but chances are I can't because I need to wait for someone else, so I sit around being frustrated. Then if I'm NOT in game mode and other people are posting, I don't really care and it's easy to ignore.<br/><br/>Not having that time set aside when we're all in game mode together really hinders my experience, so I can't stick with a PbF game very long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404573/#Comment_404573" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T14:19:04+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  2:19PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a cost vs. reward thing happening here. PbF is certainly convenient for a lot of people; it's accessible, asynchronous, and so on. There's a cost to it though. Some people find it harder to express themselves that way via text vs. face-to-face, verbal communication. (Sure, some people prefer to write than speak.)<br/><br/>The rewards are slower than f2f games. Your reward is only partly the writing. Mostly, it's the reading other people's responses to you. Creative Agenda theory, right? Other people have to validate your contribution for your group to really gel. Even if everyone is posting regularly, the pace can be slower than you need it to be, in order to get a reward that pays for the high cost of all that writing work. When it's time to log into the forum and check your posts, and you log in and no one has responded yet ("but it's been three hours!"), you get discouraged. You check in less often. You take longer to post, because your expectation of immediate reward just isn't there.<br/><br/>The compromise is synchronous text role-playing (i.e., mushes). It means sitting there for five minutes while Bob writes his monster paragraph pose, but you're probably surfing the web till your screen flashes. Then you pose (immediately, a short two-sentence response, taking a minute or two to type, because you like to keep things moving). Mentally, you start adjusting to that 2-5-minute back-and-forth and not really noticing it. There's a weird time-dilation effect that happens with mush-gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404575/#Comment_404575" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T14:25:02+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  2:25PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Other people have to validate your contribution for your group to really gel.</blockquote>\nI think that's a rather insightful point.

If you can get six months into a PbF game without having to put it on the back burner (the one waaaaay in the back that you will inevitably forget about) for something demonstrably more important and pressing, well, you live a more sedate and stable life than anyone I know. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404633/#Comment_404633" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T00:06:32+00:00" title="January 26, 2013 12:06AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let's turn this bus around.

This will keep the dice rolling, rules checks, and other housekeeping out of the story.<br/>- Allow the players greater narrative control over the minor stuff even in traditional games.  After all the GM still retains the veto if they get carried away.<br/>- Make up for the lack of feedback at the table with more descriptive writing, leverage those other senses.<br/><br/>Any others?<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404636/#Comment_404636" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T01:16:00+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  1:16AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd add have someone keep a diary of events up so that there's one place to catch up quickly if you've missed some time for some reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404640/#Comment_404640" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T01:57:52+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  1:57AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a way you can build ending points into a PbF game?

No one can really commit to the endless campaign - <i>everyone</i> flakes out of an endless campaign, eventually (even if only due to the end of their own natural life span!). The endless campaign provokes flakeyness. I agree that a campaign with an ending that one can see one is approaching (via some kind of points) is not only easier to commit to, but also becomes fun to commit to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404699/#Comment_404699" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T17:00:59+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  5:00PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been playing in a play by post OD&amp;D campaign for over four years now. It has definitely ebbed and flowed, waxed and waned. We have several pretty committed players who have been involved pretty much since the beginning (I think one of the long term players came in a bit later than the rest of us). The GM and I are the most dedicated and he appointed me "caller" to help move things along. One thing that helps is every once in a while a new player joins. Also, for those of us who have been in a long time, our characters have developed to the point where survival is reasonably assured (one PC is even an original PC, the others of us lost a PC or two or three early on) and that has created an investment that keeps us checking in. Since we are invested, I think the low commitment actually enables our participation rather than leading to lack of investment. Maybe also the fact that it's OD&amp;D has guided us away from long winded exposition so the posts are short and sweet. The GM uses several "move things along" techniques such as running multiple rounds of combat if it's clear we will keep fighting (a round of whiffs can easily just lead to another round without calling for new input from the players), or moving us quickly through portions of the dungeon with no risk (and for some reason, the dice have almost never indicated a random encounter...).<br/><br/>It's slow. Sometimes painfully slow. But it's fun.

Think more along the lines of a satisfying con scenario.  If you're playing, expectations about posting rate are a potential stumbling block.  A low posting rate is a non-starter, a high posting rate is often unrealistic.  Furthermore, GMs are often misleading when communicating their expectations about posting rates.  For example, if the GM says they're looking for at least one post a week, they may be shooting low to attract players but expect many more posts.

What tricks and tips do you use to keep interest in a PbF game going and well running?  <br/></blockquote>\nI don't PbF, but I understand the format well enough to suggest things. Adding to what Todd already said:<br/><br/>- Set expectations carefully. Start a PbF story with guidelines that include how often you expect people to post, how to take a vacation for a day or two, and how <br/>to politely bow out. That way, games don't get left in the lurch.<br/><br/>- Give up the idea of ownership of character. If anyone can play any character, people can drop in and out. Other people can keep the ball rolling when one person slacks off. Add a 'if so-and-so is on a roll, please let them keep doing it' guideline to avoid three people vying over one character. Or 'a character becomes publicly available to the first claimant after being idle 48 hours' or something.<br/><br/>- As GM, don't just ask questions. Ask questions, suggest possible answers, and describe possible outcomes for those answers. That is, lay the story-map out in front of the players so they can see where they're going. Don't hide information from players and hand bits of information out, piecemeal. That just slows everything down.<br/><br/>- If you see dice-rolling is going to happen soon, get all the players' intents, and then manage the dice all at once, quickly.

Combats end up taking a few days to resolve, but in the end, it's fine. It's fun. I guess after more than 4 years of play, I've grown accustomed to the slow pace. Every once in a while it's maddening, but overall, it's this comfortable thing waiting for engagement. And in terms of span of years, it's absolutely the longest campaign I've ever been involved in, and that's cool even if my character is just a 4/3 FM/MU split class elf.<br/><br/>The GM does do some things to move things along, but mostly lets us set the pace. And we definitely have traditional old school notion of character ownership. The GM will sometimes act in other players stead, but mostly only when invited to do so ("I'm going to be away for a few days, the GM knows generally how my character will react.").<br/><br/>Oh, and rarely is it a post per day per person (though sometimes we do manage several posts back and forth), but overall average, it might even be 1 post per week for some folks.

Thus there are super-elaborate setups but very rarely does anything actually survive once the social situation is set up.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404939/#Comment_404939" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T08:29:26+00:00" title="January 29, 2013  8:29AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2013 8:30AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some prior discussion:<br/><br/><a href="http://ww.w.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/271776]" rel="nofollow">Forum-based freeform.</a><br/><br/><a href="https://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15480/lets-talk-about-mysteries-of-systemless-internet-roleplaying/p1" rel="nofollow">The mysteries of systemless internet roleplaying.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404940/#Comment_404940" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T08:53:45+00:00" title="January 29, 2013  8:53AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might it just be that technology is leaving forums behind, in general?

Coupled with stuff like Google Drive drawings and online die rollers, you have basically the tabletop experience without the travel. Put another way: PbF enabled people in different places to play together, at ANY time. Now that the Internet supports people playing in different places at the SAME time, there's less desire to deal with all of the aforementioned pain points of PbF?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404941/#Comment_404941" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T09:04:11+00:00" title="January 29, 2013  9:04AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Asynchronicity is a huge benefit to a lot of people though.

This is why text messages are replacing phone calls.</blockquote>[aside]I think TMs are taking over phone calls more because of:<br/>* sound issues; i.e., recipient can't hear or sender don't want to be heard.<br/>* not being willing to take the time to preamble and epilogue a simple statement with the trappings of "conventional, polite" phone etiquette. (Example: I want to tell someone I'm running late, but don't want to waste time waiting to ring and connect, saying "Hi, it's me", and closing with with "OK, love you, bye-bye!" just to say "Running late; be there in 10.")<br/>* Text message templates make rapid replies a LOT faster than any other mode of communicating.[/aside]<br/><br/>But all THAT said...

The only times I've ever tried to PbF were:<br/>* A fiction collaboration forum, which is another type of bear (imagine NOTHING but backstory and dialog!).<br/>* A Google Wave playtest of Fiasco that was a fiasco (for many of the reasons in this thread, <i>exacerbated</i> by the players not really having a handle on how to use Wave's email-as-forum-as-inline-quoting/thread-forking-as-chat paradigm)<br/><br/>I just don't think it's worth the downsides to be able to play with folks with conflicting schedules or time zones. But maybe that's because I'm in EST-US: there's several million people with whom I can play by video or Skype; and still-more millions, if I'm willing to stay up a couple hours later than normal to play with CST, MST, and PST.<br/><br/>But I'm still interested in the reverse topic: what mechanics and play agendas are SUPPORTED in PbF, rather than undermined by it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus" title="Vegedus"><img alt="Vegedus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/895/n84VMHBHNTJ6O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus">Vegedus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405033/#Comment_405033" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T12:04:37+00:00" title="January 30, 2013 12:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with asynchronous play having benefits of it's own. I'd even go so far as to say that the fact alone that you can take your time, as much time as you need, before doing anything in the game, enables a truly different kind of play. For instance, a common and sage piece of advice in tabletop is to do the "obvious", perhaps because doing something is always better than doing nothing. In asynchronous play, you don't have to. You can mull it over and come up with something clever or dramatic, without being limited by your speed of thought.<br/><br/>It's also possible to invest more in setting, character and color in general than in tabletop. Personally, I dislike any setting that I can succinctly explain in 15 minutes for the purpose of starting the game, or requiring players to read the book before the first session (<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=646" rel="nofollow">oppressive social footprint</a> and all). They won't be able to actually remember all of that fully in play anyway and all that detail is wasted. While PbF players will gobble up 20-pages in shaky grammar and be excited to play in that world. And you can take a breath and refer back to that information at any time. I don't think we often notice how oppressive the need for spontaneity and fast thinking in tabletop really can be.<br/><br/>That's some pros. Cons, I think, are already apparent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405034/#Comment_405034" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T12:07:52+00:00" title="January 30, 2013 12:07PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, all, Veg.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405053/#Comment_405053" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T15:43:29+00:00" title="January 30, 2013  3:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vegedus, great comments.
