We used it in our game, that's run half a dozen sessions or so now, and players unfamiliar with the system and their character really found it helpful to generate those last four (or six, or eight) aspects on the fly when they were needed rather than up front. Same goes with skills, and probably stunts too. The important thing with SotC is to keep the pace up, so if players start plodding during character creation, just start the game and fill in the rest later. If they're grooving on it, let them finish.<br/><br/>A part of SotC I really love as a player is physical combat, and I would second the suggestion above to start the game with a big beat-em up conflict. Make sure to emphasize things like blocking actions, declarations, assistance etcetera. All these mechanics allow characters that aren't built to be combat monsters to make a visible impact in the scene.<br/><br/>If I were you, I would pit them against one or maybe two moderately powerful "named" characters, and a whole bunch of Minions. Be quick to offer concessions when the named characters start losing, so it doesn't just turn into a dice rolling exchange.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/okiran" title="okiran"><img alt="okiran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/okiran">okiran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82574/#Comment_82574" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-21T11:18:01+00:00" title="July 21, 2007 11:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the advice.

Big fights can go very long if everyone just tries to hit the other guy, but they're faster (and more awesome) when players use the skills they're good at to put aspects on opponents and then have someone tag a whole stack of them (for free!) in a dramatic explosion of badass.<br/><br/>If you're starting from a fresh slate, I'm going to suggest you use a slight variant to the wounding rules that Landon came up with which is our de facto home rule.  It works like this:  Normally, when you take stress, you can ignore it and take a consequence instead.  The first one will be minor, the second moderate and the third severe.  This has one big problem in that it can mean a really *massive* hit can be entirely canceled out at the cost of a minor consequence, which is too cheap.<br/><br/>Instead, when you take stress, you can choose how big a consequence you take, and depending on which one you pick, it reduces the level of the stress taken by a number of steps (-2 for minor, -4 for moderate, -6 for severe).  If it's reduced below 1, no box is filled out, and characters can still have only one consequence at each level, but they can take more than one consequence at a time.<br/><br/><i><b>For Example:</b> Dan has 5 stress boxes  and has taken a few hits so it looks like (OXOOX) and he takes a 7 point hit.  That would be enough to take him out.  If he were to take a minor consequence(-2), it would reduce ti to a 5 point hit, but since his 5th box is full, that would roll right back up to taking him out, so he's forced to take a moderate consequence (-4), to it becomes a 3 point hit (OXXOX).<br/><br/>Later in the fight, he takes a 12 point hit (ouch!).  Taking a major consequence (-6) reduces that to a 6 point hit, but that's still too high, so he also takes a minor consequence (-2) and reduces it to a 4 point hit, which he can take.  He's hurt badly (OXXXX and 3 consequences) but he's still standing.</i><br/><br/>Conversationally, we tend to call this the 2/4/6 method.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82691/#Comment_82691" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T11:19:08+00:00" title="July 23, 2007 11:19AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Don't be afraid to compel "good" aspects that the players are going to do anyway.

A 7-point hit to Dan's PC would simply mean he has to take his first consequence, a Mild one. It doesn't mean he's Taken Out.<br/><br/>SotC SRD, emphasis added: "If a character takes a hit which <i>takes him past a severe consequence</i>, that character is taken out."<br/><br/>Ergo, I'm not sure I understand the reason for the house rule.

He probably wouldn't, but the option is there.  So when I say a seven would take him out, assume that means before consequences are tkane into consideration.<br/><br/>But here is the problem it solves.  You and all your buddies do an awesome team up. You use a fat stack of aspects, tag them all, boost the roll to kingdom come, and you get some massive margin of success on the bad guy.  12 or more.  You have just loaded the awesome bucket into the awesome cannon and fired it down his throat.<br/><br/>And he turns it into a single minor consequence.<br/><br/>On a practical level, that makes fights go longer than then really need to, but more importantly, on an emotional level, if that happened to me, I would throw myself across the table at the GM in frustration.  If she wants to burn through a bunch of FP for the NPC's counter and such, then awesome, but otherwise my coolness can be drastically undercut by a fluke of timing, and that's non-fun.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82709/#Comment_82709" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T12:44:45+00:00" title="July 23, 2007 12:44PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, I've definitely seen the problem you describe in SotC.

Why would their player, when faced with a 7-point hit, then opt to use your house rule to take a Moderate consequence, when the rules-as-written dictate only a Mild consequence?<br/><br/>What baffles me about the house rule is that, a hit is only ever going to mean Taken Out if the PC has already taken all three of their available consequences. And, in that case, the house rule is of no use, because the PC has no consequences left to take.<br/><br/>The house rule, as I understand it, is only of use if you change the Stress rules so that <i>any</i> hit for which the PC does not have a box means they are Taken Out. Ergo, the player has to reduce the stress in exchange for a consequence, or else their PC is Taken Out.<br/><br/>Sorry to derail the thread, folks. Rob, we can take this offline/whisper if you'd prefer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82766/#Comment_82766" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T14:37:14+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  2:37PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also of note, unless I've missed something, you only ever get one "free tag" per roll, even if there are a bunch of "free-taggable" aspects.

Supposing that our example character had no boxes checked off, and took 7 hits, he could take the minor consequence to drop to 5 and be fine.  Now, in the specific example, the fact that the fifth box was already checked is the issue.  Let's step back and look at a greater MoS, like, say, 9.<br/><br/>Now, at a 9 MoS, under the old system, a minor consequence could make it all go away, so whether that's good or bad depends upon whether you're taking the hit or giving it, I suppose.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Under the new system, that big a hit means you need to jump up to a bigger consequence.  If it was an 11 MoS you'd have to go to a Major consequence or both a minor and Moderate.  That makes the big hits _feel_ more palpable, and it pushes things to deep consequense a little faster, making concession decisions a little more weighty. At 13, I need all three consequences to stay standing.<br/><br/>So, it makes characters a little more fragile, yes, absolutely, but that's a bit relative.  SOTC characters are fantastically robust, and a step down from that is still well into the realm of the heroic, and it genuinely is a time saver, which is the big reason I endorse it.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82846/#Comment_82846" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T18:13:50+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  6:13PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Now, at a 9 MoS, under the old system, a minor consequence could make it all go away, so whether that's good or bad depends upon whether you're taking the hit or giving it, I suppose.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Under the new system, that big a hit means you need to jump up to a bigger consequence.

Don't try to reconcile it with that text.  The text you're trying to reconcile it with is flat out gone. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So, this means you choose one of two worlds, only:<br/><br/>BY THE BOOK BOOK WAY (TEXT OF SOTC):<br/><br/>- When you run out of stress, you take the first available consequence in your chain of available consequences (Mild -&gt; Moderate -&gt; Severe)<br/>- Taken out only happens when you go beyond a Severe consequence.<br/>- Consequences only ever happen sequentially.  Mild comes before Moderate comes before Severe comes before Taken Out.<br/>- Concessions are the only way someone can get taken out "prematurely."<br/>- You can only ever take a single consequence as the result of an attack.<br/><br/>NEW WAY THAT IS LIKELY TO SHOW UP IN SOME FORM IN THE DRESDEN FILES RPG:<br/><br/>- When you run out of stress, you're taken out, period.<br/>- You can reduce the stress of a hit by taking a consequence: Mild gives you -2, Moderate gives you -4, Severe gives you -6.<br/>- Consequences can happen immediately, and at varied levels, throughout a fight.  There's no sequentiality to it, just a struggle to keep from getting taken out.<br/>- Concessions are still on the table and can be offered at any time you want to exit the fight without having more stuff forced on you.<br/><br/>Options on this:<br/>- You might have an Extreme level at -8, which is essentially a one time ever consequence, becoming a permanent aspect on your sheet.<br/>- You might be able to stack consequences together, taking a Mild and a Severe at the same time; alternately, allow only one consequence per blow.  It'll depend on the genre.  In a "stack-friendly" genre like pulp, taking -2 -4 -6 for a -12 total to a blow might be appropriate, giving someone a "maximum stress ceiling" of their top stress capacity plus 12.  In a "stack-averse" genre like, say, the Black Company novels or something, being limited to one consequence means your ceiling is more like max stress plus six (or eight, with the Extreme on the table).<br/>- You could treat stress "minion style" (like hit points) with this, if you wanted, or keep it "SOTC style" with numbered boxes.<br/>- This method pairs well with lower base amounts of stress (3 or 2 instead of 5).  The lower the stress, the more immediately the consequences will start showing up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83053/#Comment_83053" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T15:01:01+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  3:01PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that update, Fred.

Can a character take multiple Mild consequences (from different blows in the same scene)?

How and when they use them is up to the player. Once they use up all three consequences, they don't have any more defense against being taken out by a high-stress hit.<br/><br/>Consider that this also means you could get taken out before you use up all your consequences, simply by having a filled up stress track. If your stress track is full at 5 (XXXXX), say, and you take a hit for 7, a Moderate consequence reduces that stress down to 3. Well, that space is filled, so it just bleeds up... right off the edge of your track again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
