                    So, I've been seeing a lot of talk about character co-ownership lately, and I'm looking for examples of *structured* versions of it in games to think about.<br/>

The Shadow, in Wraith: The Oblivion.<br/>

Some ways of using the underlings types of Ars Magica<br/>

                            In the ground-breaking indie game Drowning and Falling, control over character is shared between the player, another player, and either the Drowning Master or Falling Master.  Each has an equal say in how the character addresses a challenge.                        </div>

                            Polaris? I haven't had a chance to play it yet, so I can't say how it works out in practice, but non-protagonist characters are guided by a particular player depending on their relationship (personal, societal, adversarial) to the current protagonist (so if I'm your New Moon, I always get to play any character with whom you have a personal relationship).                        </div>

                            You probably want to define what you mean by "ownership". I think this was one of issues that was gumming up Vincent's discussion on this, as he was saying one thing and other people were thinking something else.<br/><br/>That said, my game <em>The Mountain Witch</em> sorta has shared ownership. Meaning, the mechanical resources you have to use are decided by the other players. The basic idea is that  I get to decide how many Trust points you have available to spend in a given chapter of the game.                        </div>

                            In <em>Polaris</em>, yes, NPCs are shared by the group and played by different people depending on who's turn it is.<br/><br/>My group had mixed success with this. Sometimes it worked great, but sometimes if there's not a strong sense of who this character is, it becomes difficult to play the character in a satisfying way. They become a bit erratic. But this is a bit of a personal thing, as it was more of an issue with some players than with others.                        </div>

                            I think it's generally hard to have a character pass from one player to another.  It's been an uncomfortable point in my plays of Polaris.  It's also been an issue with troupe-style games (i.e. Ars Magica, Prince Valiant, Theatrix) where the game-master position rotates.  <br/><br/>So if we're including NPCs as well as PCs, you should include all of the mentioned troupe-style games in the options.  <br/><br/>I'd also add in Matt Turnbull's excellent <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/fillinthegap28oct04.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Singular Space</b></a> scenario, where all of the characters are different personalities of a multiple-personality pilot (but the primary player <i>doesn't know</i>!!).                        </div>

                            I don't think I've played in a game with shared player-character ownership, but Galactic, like Polaris, will divvy up ownership and control of NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
Ownership is an odd thing, the sense of it. I recall playing Universalis and having the main character or characters shift around a lot, but people tended to cling to specific minor characters that they'd created traits for.                        </div>

                            My Game, T:COTEC, still in development has alot of shared ownership elements. Covering not only character's (Personae in my game parlance) but virtually every element of the game world (Narrative Environment in my game language) I cover some of this breakdown in this <a href="http://wildmusings.wildmusegames.com/2005/11/26/tcotec-metaplay/" rel="nofollow">entry</a> at my design journal, Wild Musings. <br/><br/>Anyway, Personae are of one of 3 types, Company, Shared, &amp; Proprietor. Basically a shared Personae is one that someone has created and introduced into the Narrative Environment, and makes available for use by the other players. While proprietor entities are the "property" of a specific player, and there are special rules regarding what can happen to that Persona without the Proprietor's permission. <br/><br/>There is also an option for a player to "rent" a Proprietary Persona for a Scene. So this sharing of PC's is a big feature of the game. Eliminating the 1 to 1 character assumption in traditional RPG's. THe game also features distributed GM Duties, unlike in a regular RPG as well. So there is alot distance built into the basic system design, to move the focus toward the collaborative world creation &amp; communal fantasy that is the thrust of the game.                        </div>

                            Oh, just thought of another instance of Co-ownership, well actually potential co-ownership. IIRC Pendragon allowed you to play sucessive generations of a character's family, and the old Birthright supplement for D&amp;D did something similar. <br/>
<br/>
In Aria, there were a couple of approaches that although shown as single ownership didn't have to be. You had the Perpetual Genealogies where you could play members of the same family, or it could be extended to say a Noble house, or Royal Dynasty, or even Merchant House, or even a particular race/culture in the game through Aria's Interactive History mechanics. Another interesting take on that was the idea of Eternal Presences, basically semi-mythic figures that would show up through-out a particular peoples history, say something like Merlin, or other mythic "shepherd" figures. <br/>
<br/>
Another interesting take on this was what they called Individual Presence, but Archetypal Presence is a better name. Basicaly you would play the same character archetype within a race/cultures/nations history. So you might play a great General archetype, or Wartime Leader, or conqueror, etc. That showed up in a peoples history again and again over time. Neat ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, had to step away from the keyboard for a while and lost the rest of my train of thought. But that should give you some ideas of how the 1 to 1 correspondence between character's have/can be dvidied. <br/>
<br/>
This leads me into thoughts for another post. But basically, I find that using, "Third Person" characters for focus sets the stage for "Secondary Narrative" play. That is, by freeing up the single character, protragonist focus, you can engage in less story focused play, perhaps engaging "explorative vignette" play, where the idea is to experience the reality of a character or character type, a role within the Narrative Environment. Also it frees you up for "Toy" play, basically, the players can simpley engage in Setpieces, usually battles, using the unique, flavorful units that make up that NE. This is of couse the direction I am taking with my game. I would say that "Loose Coupliing" (To steal a term) of character would seem to be counter to a good "Narraivist" focused game. But I could be wrong.<br/>

But, because of the rules, it doesn't seem that it'd be quite as interesting, or dramatic, as doing it in a system where Sordid Past can be as powerful as Curiosity and the person themselves...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Tony, that is the coolest. Capes is damn tricksy &amp; cool. <br/>
<br/>
This is just character ownership, right?<br/>
<br/>
In Under the Bed all play the toys of one child, for whom any and all of the players can narrate actions/feelings/description etc.  The same for supporting characters. <br/>
<br/>
I Joshua Bishop Roby's game Conquer the Horizon, all the players can narrate aspects of the new world that is being created and though they retain control over their primary character it seems from the text that most other characters would be up for grabs. This game has awesome shared setting creation frameworks too. I don't have a link for it, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
In Breaking the Ice both players help eachother create their characters &amp; can suggest actions for each, though primary ownership is retained.  I'm working on a game right now, Shooting the Moon, that has shared character creation: your opponent gets to give you traits, and vice versa, and the one of the mechanical outcome of conflicts is to gain traits written by you or by the opponent.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and also, everytime you play any game when another player responds in character to your character, establishing them as beautiful, fearful, commanding etc--that's shared ownership too. But not necessarily structured, so whatever...                        </div>

Yep, that last bit is also co-ownership, to be sure.  <br/>
<br/>
But in order to fully 'get' this stuff, and be able to explain what the hell I'm thinking to others, I (and possibly others) need *very* clear examples to point at and think about.  Structured examples, where it's actually on paper, might provide that basis.<br/>
<br/>
Once that's firmly there, and can be stood on as a vantage, I (and possibly others) can look at smaller, less formal examples, and actually "get" them without needing to strain and confuse what we're talking about. <br/>
<br/>
Make sense?                        </div>

                            Console talks about this a little, but gives no real structured discussion of it. It's implicit (right now) that all of the characters can be shuffled around between the players without any problem; it just tends to reduce player identification with the game (and thus involvement).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should make that explicit rather than implicit. :)<br/>

                            [qoute=Andy]Wow Rob, interesting stuff. How far have you rolled along in this?[/qoute]<br/>
<br/>
Not nearly as far as I should, I have the newly revised core mechanic done, It is much more streamlined than the old one, thanks to throwing out all the dice handling in old one. It's a percentile based chart now.<br/>
<br/>
I posted by  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://wildmusings.wildmusegames.com/2005/12/03/tcotec-to-do-list/" rel="nofollow">Todo list</a> at my website as well.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to go through and do Troy Costick's power 19 deal as an exercise before I writeup the game description/blurb for my "company" website. (Once again I am reminded of Jared Sorensen's advice from the game design seminar and GenCon SoCal, "finish your damn game". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
Hopefully that will get me back in the frame of mind to work on it. Been doing lots of tangental stuf instead of workign on it. (Like redoing my website and messing around with Word press for my blog, instead of actually working on my game.)<br/>
<br/>
But I think it is damn interesting, and in a lot of ways going the opposite direction that most of the "story games" being designed are going, but still utilizing some similar techniques. Like I said, the idea of "Loose Coupling" of character's, distributed GM Duties and such I think forms a good basis for sharing up world creation and sets the stage for "toy" play, and explorative vignette play. I.e. it allows for lots of Simulationaist noodling to be made part of play, and be a rewarded or expected part of play. Also it's a direciton of design that has been explored very little.<br/>
