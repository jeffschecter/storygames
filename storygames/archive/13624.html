The version I'm most interested in is <a href="http://www.holycow.com/dreaming/stories/snow-glass-apples/" rel="nofollow">Snow, Glass, Apples</a> (Warning: Very dark, very explicit), a short story by Neil Gaiman. I am told that Tanith Lee did something similar in a story called <i>Red as Blood,</i> and the interactive fiction <a href="http://emshort.home.mindspring.com/Alabaster/index.html" rel="nofollow">Alabaster</a> is also a revisionist take, though tame compared to the Gaiman story. I'll put in some space to prevent spoilers...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The basic premise of <i>Snow, Glass, Apples</i> is that Snow White is a monster, a sexual vampiric creature that killed her own father and many others besides. Her stepmother is a wise woman, a witch, who fought to kill her fearsome stepdaughter only to be tortured to death similar to the Brothers Grimm version.<br/><br/>There are a lot of reasons to like this vision of the old story. For one thing, it makes sense. It answers a lot of the questions that Gaiman and others asked about the Snow White tale--why is she so pale? How could she lie apparently dead for some time before she came back to life? What kind of prince would fall in love with an apparently dead girl? Every disturbing undertone, including the stepmother's cruel fate, is brought to vivid life to haunt the reader for a long time. It's also well-written, it raises intriguing questions of its own, and it's beautifully and horribly tragic.<br/><br/>A roleplayer has a further reason to like Gaiman's version: It leaves unfinished business.<br/><br/>Think about it. Snow White is in power now over two kingdoms joined by marriage. The one woman who had the courage and wisdom to stand up to her failed, and met a horrible death. The gypsies, the books, the witches... any resource, person, or group that could threaten Snow are going to be hunted down and destroyed. Her dupe husband by her side, Queen Snow will impose a reign of terror on the kingdom. She has no morals that a normal human can recognize, no concept of empathy, and she has the power to dominate her prey (humanity). What she did to the forest in her childhood, she'll do to the kingdom on a larger scale. She may even breed, whatever procreation entails for her kind.<br/><br/>Who's going to stop her?<br/><br/>I think this could be a fun game or adventure module centered around characters who have the motivation to bring Snow down. Maybe they've sworn an oath, maybe they want revenge for the dead queen or other victims, maybe they're being hunted by Queen Snow. Maybe they're just ambitious.<br/><br/>System-wise I'm thinking maybe a Dresden Files hack, or something less conventional like collecting dice and traits through adventures and then rolling them for a grand finale, kind of like Shooting the Moon. Similarly, the knowledge necessary to bring Snow down could be a fixed set of facts or open to improvisation. Given the dangerous nature of the enemy and the genre, character mortality could be a pretty high possibility. So there probably should be some shared narrative authority, allowing players to invest in and control the story even if the protagonists drop off. This would allow even non-party play to work out, where one protagonist spends most of his time at the palace while another is running around the countryside talking to gypsies. Maybe I could steal some mechanics from Universalis, which I haven't really read yet.<br/><br/>Other fun elements: The dead queen herself makes an appearance in reflections in some circumstances, and/or she grants the power of mirror-gazing. Heck, maybe Snow sees her or finds out about these apparitions, and starts systematically destroying reflective surfaces--which could cause a problem if it includes drinking water. The PCs discover Snow's origin (the blood-on-snow moment could be given a horror twist for this purpose) and learn more about her. (Knowing <i>too</i> much about her, on the other hand, could ruin the horror atmosphere. Fine balance.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307858/#Comment_307858" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T02:00:54+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  2:00AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2011 2:01AM by James_Mullen.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By a strange coincedence, I have a game inspired by <i>Snow, Glass, Apples</i> ready to run at Conception this month, but it's a bit different from your take; for a start, the system I'm using is <i>My Life with Master</i>...<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>White As Snow</b><br/>\n<i>Once upon a time, there was a Wicked Step-Daughter, who consorted with evil spirits and plotted the death of her father, the King.<br/>\n<br/>\nFearing for her love, the King\u2019s new wife had the girl banished into the Dark Woods, but there she was taken in by other outcasts whose deformities had been laughed at by the common folk.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking under the guidance of the evil Snow White, her dwarves carried out the acts which would bring about her revenge...</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, as it's MLwM, Snow White will be defeated in the end and the dwarves will get their own endings, happy or otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307867/#Comment_307867" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T04:50:10+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  4:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

Having more of a relationship makes it a more intimate, and potentially even scarier, drama.

I don't have all the details to hand, but most of them are burned into my memory anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had 4 'dwarves', who were:<br/>\n<b>Turnip:</b> the deformed village idiot, who couldn't tell a lie at the weekends and was befriending a milkmaid who worked on the farm.<br/>\n<b>Bug:</b> who could control any insects except bees and who had to speak through a spider; he was in love with the woman who tended the flower garden.<br/>\n<b>Diadora:</b> an outcast for her attempted theft of the crown, she could turn invisible, right up to the point where she stole anything; she was friends with the girl who ran the bakery and with the blacksmith.<br/>\n<b>Ferret:</b> the rat-catcher who was immune to any poison except bee stings and could only wash the horrible smell away with sewage water.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story began with a panning shot across the Enchanted Forest, from which we could hear the beautiful sining of Snow White; as we closed in on her, a bird alighted on her finger, singing in harmony with her... so she bit it's head off and ate it greedily. As an outcast in the woods, she wanted to educate the Townsfolk by showing them real fear &amp; panic, so that her father the King would be deposed and she could take her rightful place on the throne.<br/>\nShe spoke to her minions one by one and gave out their first set of orders:<br/>\n<b>Turnip</b> was sent to burn the garden down, as it was attracting pests that were irritating Snow White.<br/>\n<b>Bug</b> was told to abduct the blacksmith, whose fine work was making her father's knights too strong.<br/>\n<b>Diadora</b> had some orders but these faded into insiginifcance compared to the problems she created for herself<br/>\nand <b>Ferret</b> had to unleash a plague of rats on the town crops, so that the people would starve and unrest would spread.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was lots of good re-incorporation and crossing-over of scenes, such as when <b>Turnip</b> went to see his lady friend the milkmaid, so that he could steal a bucket of milk to help him burn down the garden (!), but as he headed that way, <b>Bug</b> paid a visit to the gardener with a bunch of flowers he had stolen from Snow White's secret plot and she was so fascinated by the rare blooms that she insisted that he take her to where he had picked them! <b>Bug</b> won the roll, so 'pretended' to forget where he'd picked them and he and the gardener went for a long &amp; winding walk in the woods: when she returned, of course, <b>Turnip</b> had completed his deed, so the gardener blamed <b>Bug</b>, as his strategy had clearly been to get her out of the way while the deed was done!<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, a Comedy of Errors was set in motion by <b>Diadora</b>, who attempted to steal some cakes from the bakery and was spotted by her friend, who asked her to go to the farm and fetch some honey; luckily, smoke from the burning garden was blowing over and making the bees drowsy, but Diadora was caught by the farmer. She promised the farmer she would put in a good word for him with the baker, so she returned to town to do that, but the baker told her to go back to the farmer and tell him to come to the bakery himself with a bunch of flowers, so that she would recognise him. <b>Diadora's</b> player was being very free with the <i>Sincerity</i> die, hence why she ended up with so many side-quests!<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, <b>Turnip</b> was on a collision course with destiny by this point: having completed his first orders, he was next told to poison the food in the bakery, using the toxin found in the flowers that grew in Snow White's secret plot... by this time, <b>Bug</b> had picked all the flowers, so <b>Turnip</b> strolled into town with them and who should he pass but the baker? I actually had the player of <b>Turnip</b> bent over in laughter/shock as he cottoned on to how thoroughly I had stitched him up just by using the player's own creations. It worked out well for him, anyway, as he got to gain some <i>Love</i> with the baker.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went for a shortened version of the endgame (time is always a precious commodity at conventions) so that once anyone had stood up to the Master, they could all have a go at killing her, so they co-operated on a plan where <b>Diadora</b> stole an apple from the King's orchard, <b>Ferret</b> posioned it and <b>Bug</b> presented it to Snow White. They had a nasty moment when Snow White cut it in half and asked <b>Bug</b> to share it with her, but in the end, the bells rang out and the kingdom was saved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Ferret</b> married the baker and became a famour tourist attraction, offering children rids around the town on his hump: as he put it "Its a medieval theme park with one ride."<br/>\n<b>Bug</b> survived his brush with poisoning and went on to live happily with the gardener,<br/>\nPoor sad <b>Diadora</b> never really got over her guilt, even after she married the king, who eventually tired of her as he had tired of so many previous wives and she was bumped off.<br/>\n<b>Ferret</b> though was able to use his knowledge of poisons to save the farmer's mother from a dreadful sickness (which Ferret had caused when he accidentally poisoned the well water) and he inherited the farm!<br/>\n<br/>\nMLWM is one of my favourite games to run (I have an evil streak in me: this lets me express it without actually maiming anyone) and makes for a brilliant con-game. Everyone gets to put on strange accents and act things out if they feel like it: I had Ferret's player down on her knees in front of me a couple of times (she was miming licking my shoes!) and eveplayers tend to get into their parts with real gusto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310664/#Comment_310664" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T14:07:25+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  2:07PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fantastic. <br><br>Paul                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
