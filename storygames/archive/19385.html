It is pretty great! Just the sort of OSR thing I've always wanted!!!<br/><br/>But I have a question regarding Deft characters. Their special slot ability feels really... hollow. I'm not sure what it does. The example states that a monk attuned to his staff might parry arrows or throw it. How is that special? If the monk wasn't parrying the arrows, it would still be an attack roll. Does it mean that he may automatically parries those arrows without a roll? I mean, he can only do it once per day so that seems okay.<br/><br/>Is that what the deft character's ability is about? Auto-winning certain actions? Or can the per-day use let him do something he wouldn't normally but only once per day? How does this relate to pets? For instance, you can only use your wolf companion to bite someone once per day?<br/><br/>It feels like there is lots of good potential... but the once-per-day limitation coupled with the ability's ambiguity is making me doubt the deft character's usefulness. Especially compared to a Strong character whose specials can be used more often and rarely without cost.<br/><br/>One more question. I'm not 100% familiar with how the OGL works. Could I copy the Whitehack's text and mutate it into my own thing without much issue?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431636/#Comment_431636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-25T23:48:44+00:00" title="April 25, 2014 11:48PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One more question.

The short answer, though, is that you look at the book's product identity &amp; open content definition to see which parts of the product are licensed openly. For those parts (which often include almost all of the book) the case is indeed that you can copy and mutate. <i>However</i>, to do this under the OGL you have to license your new work under OGL as well. This is all explained in the OGL license text.<br/><br/>In general, depending on what you're doing, I tend to recommend not using OGL - and especially, particularly don't use it if you don't know anything about copyright and trademark to begin with. Often the trade-off of rights and responsibilities is not in your favour. It's a complex issue mired in legal uncertainties, heavily dependent on your jurisdiction, though, so I wouldn't wish anyone to take advice they get from random strangers on a web forum too seriously. The best general advice I can give is that if you can, it's almost certainly better to contact the publisher and ask them if they're cool with your re-publishing plans - if they are, they can just give you the go-ahead to do whatever it is you're planning to do, with no need to mix OGL or other legal uncertainties into the matter.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431641/#Comment_431641" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T02:04:44+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  2:04AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is that what the deft character's ability is about?

If you want to use the text I also suggest contacting the author Christian directly. <br/><br/>I can address the Deft question, but I can't give you an answer, since the answer what the limits for what Deft characters can do with their attunements must be negotiated by each group of players, and is best answered by how it's used in play. There's a temptation as GM to codify the Deft ability or miracle costs for Wise characters before the game even starts, but that removes one of the beautiful aspects of Whitehack, that a lot of rulings are created together by the whole group. It's still a good idea to think about the rulings beforehand and come into the session with an idea of a framework, so I can tell you what my group has done. I want to be clear that this is not how it has to be done!<br/><br/>Deft characters can attune themselves to a specific person, object, or animal. The person is usually a mentor, but can be anyone inspiring that is skilled in the same area. The person doesn't have to be present for the Deft character to use their attunement; the player can say "I run across the rope just like master Bolger taught me". I suggest using specific objects rather than the generic "I can use any rope". Instead, the rope was perhaps a gift from the character's father. If the rope is lost you can either let the character attune themselves to any new object, or you can make them quest to find the fabled elven rope of Nollaig. An attuned animal would probably get some higher-than-normal level of communication with the Deft character, and could even be controlled by the player when on scouting missions, if you like that. Deft characters get two attunements from the start, one active and one inactive. We mark the inactive slots in parenthesis on the character sheet.<br/><br/>There are many different levels on how mechanically the Deft attunements are handled. My idea is that if it's something anyone can do with a dice roll, a Deft character can do it without a roll, once per day of course. If it's something outside of the ordinary, where other people wouldn't even get a roll, the Deft character can attempt it with a normal roll. If they want to do something that's pure color, they succeed automatically.<br/><br/>An example from my game was a Deft halfling adventurer (class species vocation) that was attuned to his sling. I let him bounce a sling stone on the wall around a corner to hit an approaching skeleton with a normal attack roll. Another character wouldn't even get a roll and would fail automatically. The same character was attuned to his rope. He considered using the rope in another fight to snare an opponent, and since I would have let anyone try that with an attack roll I would've let him succeed automatically. The once-per-day limit makes it less likely that this will be abused over and over. They can auto-snare someone once a day, but then they can't use the rope for anything else spectacular that day.<br/><br/>Same thing with parrying arrows. If it's purely color to establish how bad-ass the character is, I'll let them succeed automatically. If it's a tense fight situation they may have to make a save or a dexterity roll. Again, since it's once a day the risk for abuse is low. It is supposed to give a definite edge to the Deft character, so it's no fun if it's too limited.<br/><br/>I haven't had an attuned animal in the game yet. Or rather, we had an attuned dog last session, but true to our habits we forgot about it when we entered the dungeon. I would have let the dog attack multiple times a day, like a normal hireling, but it could only be used for something spectacular once a day. That could be leaping to catch a ring before it falls down a well, or to sniff out the most virtuous man in town, or something like that. It would really be the player suggesting things and me leading the discussion on benefits and drawbacks to allowing it.<br/><br/>It's usually best to let the player do what they suggest, since it's usually something cool, but then have a discussion between sessions if you think it didn't set a good precedence. It's always easy to decide later that it was a once-in-a-lifetime thing to let the dog attack five guards with one attack roll, and that it can't be used that way reliably in the future.You can also decide that it was that specific elven rope of Nollaig that could be used to snare people in combat. The next Deft character with an attuned rope may not get to do it.<br/><br/>If you look at how open-ended the three classes are I would put them, from least to most: Strong, Wise, Deft. Strong characters are perfect for people who want to have clear picture of what their character can or can't do. Note that they don't even have inactive slots, so the combat option they pick is the one they get from the start. The Wise is in the middle because of the HP costs for their miracles. They are as open-ended as the Deft when it comes to deciding what they want to accomplish, but the HP cost "codifies" their ability more. When the Deft uses their attunements it sets a precedent, but it will be open for re-negotiation each time it's used. The Deft have combat abilities if their vocation is relevant to the situation, which also opens up for negotiation. When can, for example, the duelist use their ability? Only in formal duels with one opponent, in a fight with a troll, always?<br/><br/>It is important to embrace the intentional vagueness of certain parts of the rules as something unique and positive. It enables the group to create their own game as they play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431650/#Comment_431650" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T06:56:56+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  6:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jonas Ferry. That was a far more succinct answer then I thought I'd get! I have a much clearer picture now. I certainly wouldn't want to codify the deft character's ability but a soft structure or a little more guidance wouldn't have hurt. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Read and understand the OGL (as well as basics of copyright and trademark law for your own jurisdiction) if you're going to use it.</blockquote>Reading the OGL page at the end of the book... it says the name Whitehack, the trade dress, the White Curse setting and adventures are all Product Identity.<br/><br/>I'm not terribly interested in publishing anything. I want a PDF for my tablet and an altered version of the Whitehack text to fit my personal tastes. I thought maybe I would share my results with others but if it turns out to be a big legal thing... then keeping the stuff I made for personal use shouldn't be an issue, I assume.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431661/#Comment_431661" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T09:46:48+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  9:46AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can do whatever you want with it as long as you don't publish the thing, legally speaking. (Distributing it selectively to your friends is not publishing; those old "you are allowed to copy this particular page for your own use" declarations common to rpg books are over-reaching legalese that shouldn't be taken to mean that the publisher actually could stop you from doing just that. Or I don't know, I guess there could be some jurisdiction somewhere where a publisher can limit you from copying a page from a book for your friend.)<br/><br/>Regarding publishing your alterations, you can only use those Product Identity elements with separate permission from the owner. So assuming that the rest of it is free content, you can republish those parts if you include the OGL in your republication, and follow its instructions (such as copy the copyright statement from the Whitehack in its entirety into your republicated version).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
