In the meantime, a few of the city's citizens start transforming and exhibiting weird, special powers (i.e., they get D&amp;D races and classes). It's a setting that looks at transformation, community, and survival. My test campaign is set in Oxford, England, in the Fall of 1605.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Cast</b><br/><br/>A month ago, we met and made up characters. It was just me, Daniel Levine, Tom Cadorette, and Craig. Last night, Tom brought two of his friends, Jody and Brian. Both are serious 4E gearheads and I'm told Jody is an ENnies Judge. Cool.<br/><br/>So, the characters... I hope the players will forgive me and correct me if I misrepresent them, as I'm largely doing this from memory.<br/><br/>Daniel has a small menagerie of PCs he created. He was going to play his peasant-girl-turned-warden, but changed his mind at the last minute. For the first game, he chose <a href="http://transit.legendary.org/index.php/Joachim_del_Azores" rel="nofollow">Joachim</a>. Joachim is a Portuguese marrano (crypto-Jew) who is pretending to be a Catholic pretending to be an Anglican so the English don't burn him at the stake. It's complicated, but it works. After the metrocalypse event, Joachim found himself being tattooed by the burning holy light. He awoke a deva and found he had the power to unleash G-d's terrible fury on his foes. He's adopted a role of guardian of the Bodleian Library, which had about 3000 books at that time. (Joachim is a <i>deva invoker</i>.)<br/><br/>Tom created Nicholas, a very cynical atheist. He's a smart man, so he pretended to be devout and such, but he couldn't help but debate with the theology professors when he was a student. After the metrocalypse, his sharp tongue now threw powerful barbs that actually injured people. Worse, he had been transformed into the visage of a devil to punish him for his sins. Nicholas has been trading with the native kobold tribes. He gives them small Oxfordian treasures and they give him food and other supplies. (Nicholas is a <i>tiefling bard</i>.)<br/><br/>Craig plays The Spaniard. He has a real name, but it's long and complicated and Spanish, and we dubbed him "The Spaniard" before he chose his name, and the nickname stuck. The son of wealthy, but mostly unimportant nobles, the Spaniard learned guerrilla warfare techniques in Spain and was employed as a spy and infilitrator by the Spanish diplomatic delegation to England. He's a womanizer and swashbuckler with a dark edge. Catholic, too. After the metrocalypse, he found himself only a little changed. His appearance had grown slightly fey (but it only made him better looking, I'm sure) and he felt his infiltration skills were far sharper than before. He is also trading with the kobolds, and he might have a friendly rivalry with Nicholas. (The Spaniard is a <i>half-elf rogue</i>.)<br/><br/>Jody statted up Shawn. He was a stone mason in his past life -- the actual profession, not the secret society (but I'm trying to convince him to change that). Also, I believe he's a Church of E type (the only one in the group). After the metrocalpse transformation, Shawn grew to enormous size and his body became covered with fine stonework. His fighting skills improved drastically, too. Shawn lent a hand to Daniel to help protect the Bodleian Library with muscle and masonry. (Shawn is a <i>goliath fighter</i>.)<br/><br/>Brian is playing Devon, another secret Jew who had to fake being a good Anglican to avoid getting burned at the stake. Her deceit required her to study Anglicanism in great detail. After the metrocalypse, Devon discovered she had the power to change her form in drastic ways. She immediately decided to pretend to be a male priest of the Church of England. Devon is keeping up this masquerade, but finds she can wield the holy power of the Cross. Devon has a vested interest in protecting the volumes in the Library--and learning as much as she can to keep up her lies. (Devon is a <i>shifter cleric</i>.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208332/#Comment_208332" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T12:58:41+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 12:58PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Beginnings: Protecting the Bodleian Library</b><br/><br/>So, first an apology to my players. I kept telling them that the library was in Christ Church Cathedral, but it's not. I checked today. The Bodleian Library, which housed around 3000 books by the start of the 18th Century, was actually in the University Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, on High Street. St. Mary's turns out to be pretty cool, since the former was established in Anglo Saxon times and would be around 600 years old by 1605 (though the oldest remaining part -- the tower -- was built in 1280), and not the gigantic monster of a building and courtyard that the Cathedral is.<br/><br/>Anyway, the group sort of organized themselves around the Library, so I staged the first encounter there. Joachim and Devon both served in the Library, mostly guarding the treasures (including books) and monks there. Nicholas and the Spaniard had a reason to be there: Joachim would trade smaller artifacts from the church for the stuff they needed, and Nicholas and the Spaniard were the go-betweens who traded with the kobold tribes. Shawn was there to help with guard duty and masonry tasks.<br/><br/>One night, a raiding party of strange, small, impish-looking creatures crashed through a stained glass window with a battering ram. I drew out the halls of the area around the Library and noted doors, windows, bookshelves, rolling wooden ladders, and some statues. The raiding party really consisted of "reskinned" goblins: 1 goblin hexer (controller), 2 goblin skullcrushers (brutes), and 8 goblin cutters (minions). Devon got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time -- alone in the hall with the minions -- and got swarmed. He had 10-15 points of damage in the first round and declined to take his opportunity attack against the careless imp combatants because he (Brian) didn't imagine Devon-the-unarmed-priest going to fisticuffs. Another minion ran crazed through a door into a smaller antechamber and attacked Nicholas.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Spaniard was sneaking into the long hallway from the other end. He tried to hide behind a statue as he approached the raiding party. Unfortunately, the imp leader cast a hex on him. The fibers of the carpet grew and writhed like snakes and wrapped around the rogue's ankles, rooting him to the floor (and threatening to cut him badly with 12 damage if he moved).<br/><br/>Joachim burst in and heaved a ball of angry holy light at one of the minions, frying it.<br/><br/>The heroes seemed stunned by what happened next. The two imp brutes charged in and, instead of hammering on them, avoid them and grabbed one of the large and very expensive statues in the hall, and then tried to carry it out of the Library! Joachim blasted one of them and slammed the brute back against the wall. The brutes gave up on stealing for now and started attacking people.<br/><br/>At some point, Nicholas used one of his new powers to blind the imp leader. According to the rules, a blind creature can attack by guessing the square an enemy is in and then attacking at a -5 penalty. Well, Nicholas hadn't moved since using the power, so the hexer targeted his last known location and I rolled very well. The leader dug a handful of sand out of a bag and blew on it. Wind spirits carried the grit thirty feet and blinded Nicholas with it. An eye for an eye.<br/><br/>Shawn was cornered by three of the imp cutters, but luckily there was a door to his back. He slid into temporary safety and started fighting back. He held up his cross and glowing light burned cross-shaped char marks into the foreheads of his foes, killing them! At one point, he pointed his cross like a weapon and a beam of holy light punched a hole right through an imp's torso, like a laser might.<br/><br/>To fight the hexer and his two brute bodyguards, Joachim summoned his anger. His body flashed with light and his shadow fell on the ground then animated as a creature of holy fire. This angel of fire fought the brutes for a short time before they destroyed it.<br/><br/>The heroes were taking a fair amount of damage. The minions could drop 4 damage on a hit -- 5 if they could flank -- and the brutes' axes regularly hit for 12 or so. The hexer could hit for 5-6 damage or blind or pin someone down with his curses. The cleric and bard had to heal themselves and others a couple times.<br/><br/>After a brief spat of fighting, the last remaining minion decided to flee for his life. The leader fell, then one of the brutes shortly after. The remaining brute started to run, but Joachim shouted him down (a really good Intimidation roll). The skullcrusher dropped his axe and came back like a scared puppy. They tried to talk to him but no one could speak his language, which had no Earthly origin. After some frustrating attempts at sign language communication and some debate about what to do with the captive, the group decided to just kill him. Joachim led the brute outside and slit his throat.<br/><br/>They spent some time after that cleaning up the library. In the days after that, Shawn shored up the windows and some of the doors with stone walls. The Library is more defensible now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208333/#Comment_208333" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T12:58:58+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 12:58PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Travel: Encounters in the Streets</b><br/><br/>The Spaniard had met some Englishmen in the city. They talked of a growing community of other people who were huddling together in the safety of numbers. The Spaniard received an invitation to stop by the Bear Inn, talk to the Mayor, and join their community.<br/><br/>The group decided to go meet these people. It was not a long trip, purely measured by distance, but the roads are now clogged with jungle trees and underbrush and filled with monstrous things. Joachim decided to stay back and guard the Library (probably because Daniel wasn't feeling well). On the way, a bunch of them noticed a shadow pass over them. Nicholas perceived that the shadow was dragon shaped. He looked up and saw a ginormous fucking dragon, dark green with long veins of angry red. As he flew, contrails of smoke streamed out of nose and down over his serpentine neck and wide wings. Tom decided that Nicholas should stand in a clearing and gape for a better look...<br/><br/>Wondering if my florid description of a very, very dangerous and huge dragon was too subtle for Tom, I asked him if he was sure, and he said yes. I didn't want a total party kill on the first night because of one player, so I went a little easy on the group, but I think (and hope) it scared them a little. I had them make Stealth checks to hide in the forest as the dragon swooped down a blasted the with huge waves of fire. The Spaniard rolled well; everyone else failed. Since Craig had stated that he wanted the Spaniard to hang back about 20 feet and watch the dragon attack, I gave him 1d10 damage. The others got 2d10 damage. There was lots of wincing around the table, because it hurt a lot and they knew it wasn't over. They started running for their lives. The Spaniard went his own way. The other three stuck together, making a juicy target. I let Devon make an Athletics check to lead the group to safety. After a couple failures, and 1d10 more damage each time, they managed to get a decent roll. The dragon botched his Perception check, and the group huddled in an abandoned stone building till the dragon got bored and went back to Oxford Castle, where it had taken up residence.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Bear Inn: Meeting the Mayor</b><br/><br/>Oxford's mayor, Richard Bryan, operated a safe house in his tavern, the Bear Inn. I had learned the name of Oxford's mayor in 1605 and had learned that he was a brewer and continued to operate the Bear Inn on Alfred Street, so I just had to use this. He had a growing community of about 100 people who lived in the block of buildings near the Inn. By banding together, they were able to fight off threats. I let the players know that these seemed to be normal, untransformed people, and that statwise they were minions (1 hit point each).<br/><br/>I reminded them that many of the PCs look normal or mostly normal, but some distinctly did not. The Spaniard has slightly elfin features. Shawn is 7'-8' tall and has stony growths on his skin. Joachim looks like some kind of dark-skinned angel, with Hebraic writing on his face. And, of course, Nicholas looks like a freaking devil. Only Devon looked like a completely normal person. I told Tom that people's reaction to Nicholas usually involved pointing, screaming, and fleeing. Nicholas decided to go along anyway and try to talk and reason his way in.<br/><br/>The Bear Inn was guarded by two halberdiers who were terrified of Nicholas' appearance. Devon and the Spaniard tried to persuade them to relax and let them all in, but they wouldn't budge. I had called for a Diplomacy check (DC 25) and they'd rolled well but had come up a couple point short. Nicholas decided to try to talk to them himself. I gave him an additional -5 penalty because of his appearance, but he used one of his encounter powers to sway their friendship. Doing that, and by rolling incredibly well, Nicholas managed to beguile and talk his way past the guards, who followed him in and left the front door unguarded. Shawn stood guard outside, perhaps sensing that his giant size might make things uncomfortable in the crowded tavern.<br/><br/>The inn was a simple affair. Three stories with rooms upstairs, and a crowded room full of tables on the main floor and a simple tap room in the back. The people in the tavern screamed when the devilish Nicholas entered, of course. The three adventurers spent some time convincing the people that he wasn't going to take them all to Hell. Eventually, Mayor Richard Bryan came out of the tap room. Some more Diplomacy checks got Bryan to trust them. Devon being a priest definitely helped smooth matters over.<br/><br/>The Mayor asked them about the Library and suggested that they use the books for kindling, since the jungle wood was proving a poor source of firewood. This appalled the heroes. They learned a bit more about the Mayor's community. Bryan invited the heroes to join his group. Ultimately, I think they'll decline, but we'll see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208334/#Comment_208334" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T12:59:08+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 12:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Lessons Learned</b><br/><br/>That's about where we left things until the next game.<br/><br/>The game session could be divided into five sections: setup, combat in the library, role-play in the library, hazards of the streets, and role-play with the Mayor. The library combat and the Mayor parlay were planned encounters. I ad-libbed the rest.<br/><br/>We'd started pretty late. Tom (who drove Jody and Brian) got lost in College Park. Daniel had work issues. Once we finished gnoshing some pizza and meeting the new folks, it was 8 PM, an hour past the scheduled start time. It took me a few minutes to get my books and whatnot organized around me, but I had prepped encounters and found the pogs I needed and put them aside. We spent 15-30 minutes talking about how to get everyone together as a group, and came up with the Bodleian Library connection.<br/><br/>The combat encounter was fun, I think, but it took about 75 minutes to run five rounds of combat. I could have been a little faster on calling out initiative order. I may hand that off to a player next time, since there's no reason for the DM to track that crap. Most of the players took some time to figure out what they wanted to do. 4E presents a handful of options to characters where 3E often only gave a player one useful option -- this is a wonderful change in terms of being tactically interesting, but it often means thinking about stuff takes up game time. Also, 4E gives every player a standard action, a move action, and a minor action during his turn; in 3E, a player had to choose to move or do something like attack and less to do made things quicker. I think the players will get quicker as they master their characters' power lists.<br/><br/>I could have sped up the combat a bit by knowing my monsters better and by printing out a reference card for each of the three monster types. A fair bit of my time was spent finding the right creature on the two Monster Manual pages in front of me.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching the group role-play without me. It felt like real D&amp;D, not a series of flavorless tactical encounters, as many people have called 4E. There wasn't a ton of this kind of role-playing though. I think it will pick up as players get more comfortable with their characters and have more <i>stuff</i> to role-play about. I will continue to lead them a little with questions about morality and how they feel about issues. There's a lot of fodder here for great fun.<br/><br/>The street encounter could have been better. It was all DM-fiat, really. I'd decided long ago that a huge red dragon had moved into Oxford Castle. Partly I did this to keep the players from making the most defensible place in the city their base right away. Partly, though, I just thought it was cool and great atmosphere to have this giant death monster flying around to remind them that the city was terribly dangerous. I did not expect Tom to have his character stand in the middle of a clearing and gawk at it. When he did, the only logical thing to do was attack, but I had painted myself into a corner: I also did not want a TPK on the first game night, especially if the encounter wasn't balanced by the books. A 6th level encounter would be really tough, but fair. A 15th level encounter would not be fun or fair, though one can argue that "fair" also includes playing the world as a real, living place, and that the character had asked for it. There's a world of GNS theory in this, but I'm not gonna go there right now.<br/><br/>In the end, I decided to treat the encounter as a giant hazard and series of tough skill checks. The players rolled crappy at first and got burned up badly. I think that scared the crap out of them. As described above, eventually the dice evened out and they escaped. Because Craig had chosen to have the Spaniard go off alone, I threatened him with a wandering monster roll, which didn't go in his favor. I was going to have some kind of nasty creature attack him, but it was getting late and I wanted to get to the meaty role-playing encounter, so I told Craig that I owed him one. Heh.<br/><br/>The encounter at the Bear Inn went well and served its purpose. Mainly, I wanted to showcase that the characters (especially Nicholas) were freaks to the rest of the Oxfordians. They also met the Mayor and were introduced to his backward, conservative ways. Over time, his conservatism will be more of a source of conflict in the game.<br/><br/>Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves, though there were complaints about not getting enough done (with concessions made to the fact that we started an hour late). Overall, it went very well. I'm looking forward to the next game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
