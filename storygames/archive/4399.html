We take turns trying to one-up each other, coming up with more Cool things - maybe like an auction. Whenever some maxes out the Cool Stuff, they get a Token and we move on. Whatever.<br/><br/>This breaks down in two ways:<br/>(1) Over-Escalation. You say "he jumps into his car", and then I say, "THE CAR TRANSFORMS INTO A DIESEL-POWERED MECHA AND DEFEATS THE REBEL ARMY", then, well, we're done already. I was selfish, and I get the token.<br/>(2) Lame stuff. You say "he jumps into his car", and then I say "The car is actually a black hole in space!!", then I just escalated things past the point of cool, into <i>not cool</i>. The scene is clearly done (because I broke it), and I get the token.<br/><br/><b>Better!</b><br/><br/>So the same kind of mechanism, EXCEPT: someone says "Enough!", and the penultimate Cool person (NOT the last person) is the one that gets the reward. With hope, this rewards people who create Cool content while gently discouraging (1) and (2).<br/><br/>(If we're all consensually and socially trying to get the most Cool Stuff of our game, we'll focus on that, and not merely trying to win that damn Token, of course. The Token is more just a codified way to keep us giving each other feedback and not just maximizing but also *moderating* our inputs to make everyone the most happy.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99289/#Comment_99289" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T14:06:24+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  2:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or you could have a "whoa, back up" ritual phrase which meant that the last contribution was too over the top and it's someone else's turn.

They tend to price a good at the level of the person who is least accurate in their assessment of its worth.  That makes sense in the contact of "narrativist" games where each player's assessment is the very point of the game, i.e. by bidding up ridiculously high in a moral conflict, you are making that moral statement that "narrativist" play requires.  Well and good. It doesn't make much sense in collaborative games where you must aim for an aggregate of people's contributions rather than reward the outliers - even the "second place" outlier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99603/#Comment_99603" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T16:27:44+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  4:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To continue talking about the mechanical approach, though: what if every one-ups adds a token to the pot.

So the "inverse triangular" is my (slightly jerky) shorthand for the reverse.  It's the same relationship you get when you have to spend "the current level" in XP to raise a skill or something.<br/><br/>To do the calculations really easily, imagine if each "turn" in Dev's auction, you put a penny down.

Dev, this seems similar to how another game functions, only in reverse, and is similar to what Judson is talking about. The game in question is one I ran into at UW Madison at a place called the Essen House, called "Boot About." It's a drinking game where the idea is that a glass boot of beer (a couple of litres, I think), is passed around a table to the left. Each player drinks as much as he likes (first pinging the glass ceremonially). The player to the right of the player who finishes the boot in one take, pays for the next boot. <br/>\n<br/>\nVery simple. But what it means is that each player has to play conservatively, until the boot gets down to the point where they think that:<br/>\nA) They might be able to finish it off, and<br/>\nB) if they don't then they think that the player on their right may be able to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, in case it's not obvious, this game can get people incredibly drunk in very short order. Even born Wisconsonites living at the UW (who drink more than anyone on the planet, easy). Play at your own risk. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust had to mention it as a similar sort of mechanic to what you're talking about. I think this sort of natural guesstimate limitation activity is a powerful way to keep folks on track toward something. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
