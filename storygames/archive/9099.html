System, that sort of thing). Originally D&amp;D was inspired by wargames, but I think that card games could be equally as inspiring. Thinking of CCGs in terms of RPGs brings to mind high levels of fiddly rules at first, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that way. I know some games use cards (In a Wicked Age's Oracles come to mind, but that reminds me more of a tarot deck than a CCG).  I think that D&amp;D 4e sort of moved in the direction of CCGs with the way its powers work. Hell, some people even make cards with their powers on them. Still though, it plays more like a war-game than a CCG.<br/><br/>Anyways, I was wondering what people thought about the relationship between CCGs and RPGs. What lessons could be learned from CCGs? Has anyone made (or is making) any games inspired by CCGs? <br/><br/>Personally, I think that the playing of cards representing characters or events, with more powerful or significant things being played as the game progresses to be a dynamic just waiting to be exploited by an RPG, but I'm interested in hearing what Storygames thoughts on the subject might be. Not sure if many of you guys are current or former CCG players, but feel free to chime in anyways if you have anything you want to add.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201205/#Comment_201205" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T01:31:27+00:00" title="April  8, 2009  1:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the advantage in card-based games is that they can have relatively simple main rules, but then the cards can have most of the 'real' rules on them.  The cards cover all the exceptions, the special cases, it's the common rule-book phrase "unless you have a card that says otherwise".<br/><br/>The lesson you probably don't want to take is that of having to learn what all the cards are, so you know what can counter the cards you have.  This effect is inevitable, but minimizing it will help new players from getting annoyed by it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201232/#Comment_201232" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T07:26:11+00:00" title="April  8, 2009  7:26AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2009 7:26AM by merb101.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though not a CCG, the still-in-development <b>Dungeoneer RPG</b> is a role-playing game based on a card/miniatures game and it keeps the use of cards as its main mechanic. <br/><br/><a href="http://dungeoneering.blogspot.com/2009/02/dungeoneer-rpg-mock-up.html" rel="nofollow">Here is a mock-up of the game from the designer's blog.</a><br/><br/>ME<br/><br/>edited to fix link                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201234/#Comment_201234" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T07:46:51+00:00" title="April  8, 2009  7:46AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>What lessons could be learned from CCGs?</blockquote>\nMultiple resources.

For me, the big things to take away are the way the cards are templated in order to communicate the rules and facilitate easy understanding when seeing a new card, and how the game is able to work regardless of the level at which it is being played.  Whether it is people at a kitchen table or a pro tournament with tens of thousands of dollars on the line, the game doesn't fall apart, despite the thousands of cards printed and their countless interactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201245/#Comment_201245" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T08:43:37+00:00" title="April  8, 2009  8:43AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2009 8:45AM by Tristan.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been toying with the idea of substituting a character sheet for cards.

That is, I can tailor my deck to my liking, but I'm still limited by what cards happen to be in my hand at any particular time.  Perhaps this feeling could be factored into an RPG somehow, without using an actual deck of cards.  You create a character from a set of abilities or aspects, and then your roll (or otherwise randomize) to see which aspects are available to you for a particular scene?

Although I could see power creep either coming in naturally or as an advancement mechanic of sorts. <br/><br/>This can be a problem in CCGs though. Better cards make you want to buy new ones. It's worse in some games than others. Magic is an OK example, especially as of late (although they do a much better job of stopping this than the majority of CCGs I've played), but many other card games suffer greatly (for example, in the first set of yu-gi-oh, a standard monster might have 1500 attack points. In a later set, it's the same exact card except that now its 1900. Thing is, in yu-gi-oh? The higher number always wins, and there is no random element. You can see why this is a problem.)<br/><br/>I think that the emergence of new strategies and invalidation of some old ones is part of the fun though. That would, be something I would consider a feature, although I could see how you'd think it was a bug.<br/><br/>Also, mageknight? I played a whole lot of that game but I didn't feel that bad of a power creep.

The very first set had what remain some of the most powerful cards ever, because Richard Garfield underestimated the game's popularity.  Magic R&amp;D has done a great job exploring horizontal design space and not just printing cards that are strictly better than what has come before.  At the same time, the way people play the game has evolved, and that has changed the value of certain cards and strategies.  The thriving Vintage and Legacy formats in Magic go to show that it's not just people who got in on the ground floor that are able to compete, even against the classically \u201cbest\u201d cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201418/#Comment_201418" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T09:37:54+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  9:37AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Anyone remember<a href="http://ruyeyama.best.vwh.net/arcadia/atwh-rpt.html" rel="nofollow">Arcadia: The Wyld Hunt</a>?

I was going to mention it, but never got around to posting.  Anywho, it wasn't quite an RPG, as everything was card based, but it did have a fairly neat system.  I only ever bought a few packs, but it's one of those things that I'd probably splurge on if I ever found a discount box of cards.  I'd probably never get around to playing it though. :P<br/><br/>I wish this thread had existed three months ago when I tossed two boxes (one character, one story) of Arcadia cards in the recycling during a bookshelf-clean. I would've sent them to you for the cost of postage!

They are -never- going to sell, and at least then they'll be off your shelf. And I'll buy *rummage rummage* this Vampire hardback, so it won't be -entirely- free"), so it would've been good to perpetuate the cycle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201425/#Comment_201425" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T10:12:55+00:00" title="April  9, 2009 10:12AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>...*snip*...</blockquote>\nDang!

That would, be something I would consider a feature, although I could see how you'd think it was a bug.</blockquote>\nYea, I'm just bringing up what I think are some defining characteristics of CCGs.  Emergence of new strategies is good, except when it makes whole sets of old cards useless.\n<blockquote>Also, mageknight? I played a whole lot of that game but I didn't feel that bad of a power creep. Weird.</blockquote>\nMaybe it was just the particular faction I was playing.  But within 3-6 months of the game coming out there was a strictly better version of one of my main units.  I was mostly annoyed because I liked the game, but just wanted to play with what I had, yet I came to be at a disadvantage to anyone who came into the game later than me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201491/#Comment_201491" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T21:25:31+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  9:25PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arcadia: the Wyld Hunt was a fun little CCG, but it failed partly because nobody bought all that much of it. You actually <i>could</i> just pick up a handful of packs, choose the cards you liked, and play... possibly without making any further purchases. The card combos that you're playing might not be optimal but they'll be <i>playable</i>, and there was no tournament-based motivation to build killer characters.<br/><br/>Compare to games like M:tG or VTES, both very long-lived, in which you build large decks of cards, and will probably need to buy a lot of cards to get combinations that even work, let alone are optimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201502/#Comment_201502" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T07:16:04+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  7:16AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have three shoeboxes crammed with Magic cards a friend of mine gave me while cleaning out his garage.
