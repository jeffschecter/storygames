It's a great game.  If I didn't love it, I wouldn't have written this big long thing about how I play it.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful game, but, like so many wonderful things, it's not without its problems.  Word on the street is that a third version is in the works; I look forward to it.  This document addresses the second version.<br/><br/>You may find it useful to have a copy of the rules on hand as you read this.  I'll be assuming that you're familiar with the game text as written.  Some knowledge of GNS/"The Big Model" wouldn't hurt.  And a familiarity with the IIEE (Intention - Initiation - Execution - Effect) model would be useful.<br/><br/><br/>You can safely assume that if I've skipped over a part of Primetime Adventures here that it's because I find it perfect the way it is.  That includes everything about pitching a show, Screen Presence, Fan Mail, along with a lot of other stuff.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Protagonist's Issue</b><br/><br/>Skipping over everything that works takes us right to Protagonists in general, and The Issue in specific, starting on page 12.<br/><br/>"A protagonist's issue is his or her most defining characteristic." -- pg 12<br/><br/>No.  No, no, no, no.  No.<br/><br/>Forget that entirely.  <br/><br/>Okay, so.  What is an Issue?  What makes a good Issue?<br/><br/>A good Issue is one that the character is ambivalent over.  It's something he has strong and mutually-exclusive feelings about.<br/><br/>Some examples, as expressed in-character:<br/><br/>"I want to drink less, but it's the only thing that makes life bearable."<br/><br/>"I don't like violence, but sometimes it seems like the only answer."<br/><br/>"I love her, but our relationship puts her in danger."<br/><br/>There's a common pattern here:  I want X, and I also want Y, but I can't have both X and Y.<br/><br/>The way the Issue is expressed and explored in a scene, an episode, and a series is straightforward: push the character into choosing between X and Y.  Make them live with the consequences.  Repeat.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Protagonist's Traits</b><br/><br/>Now that you've got Issue nailed down, what about Traits?  Refer to pages 14-16 in the game text, if you like.<br/><br/>One way to think about Traits is by how they relate to the Issue.  Often, a character will have one Trait that's mostly related to one side of the Issue and another Trait which is strongly related to the other.  They're often, but not always, of the same type (either both Edges or both Connections.)<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/><br/>Issue:  "I want to succeed at work, but that doesn't leave much time for me to be a good father"<br/>  First Trait:  "My daughter" (Connection)<br/>  Second Trait:  "My boss" (Connection)<br/><br/>Issue: "I want to drink less, but it's the only thing that makes life bearable."<br/>  First Trait:  "Trauma Surgeon" (Edge)<br/>  Second Trait:  "War Veteran" (Edge)<br/><br/>Issue: "I don't like violence, but sometimes it seems like the only answer."<br/>  First Trait:  "Priest" (Edge)<br/>  Second Trait:  "My vampire son" (Connection)<br/><br/><br/><b>The Third Trait</b><br/><br/>This leaves us with one more Trait to define, and it is often fairly neutral with respect to either side of the dilemma.  It can be a reflection and tie-in to the theme of the series.  Examples here include "Superhero", "Ninja", "Witch", "My faithful sidekick", etc.<br/><br/>It's this "third Trait" which is often recognizeable as "the protagonist's defining characteristic."  He's "that secret spy guy" or "that guy with the talking car".  You can't really use a character's Issue in the same way -- "Hey, it's that guy who is sometimes hard at work but sometimes he's at home."<br/><br/><br/>(continued...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343515/#Comment_343515" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T14:06:29+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  2:06PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued...)<br/><br/><br/><b>Anatomy of a Scene</b><br/><br/>This starts on page 26 of the game text.<br/><br/>In terms of authority and who does what, here's what happens (or should happen) with a scene:<br/><br/><br/>1.  A player (or initially, the producer) makes a request for a scene to the producer.  The player specifies the Focus, the Agenda, and the Location.  The thing I want to talk about here is Agenda.<br/><br/>"The agenda is a general description of what happens in the scene."  Yes, indeed, this is so.<br/><br/>"[The agenda] should explain what the likely conflict is."<br/><br/>No.  No, no, no, no.  No.<br/><br/>The Agenda is strictly a plot-level tool.  "The doctors talk about what the disease might be" or "The detectives look around for clues" or "Jim and Sarah are getting married."<br/><br/>In investigative or mystery sorts of shows, the Agenda often revolves around investigating, finding clues, solving mysteries, etc.<br/><br/>Note that it's very often the case that all the protagonists in a scene share the same Agenda -- they all want to find the clue, solve the mystery, etc.  That's fine.<br/><br/>Once the scene is played through, near the end, we generally get a Fulfillment of the Agenda.  "The doctors decide to start a particular treatment and run a particular set of tests", "the detectives send some stuff off to a lab and follow a clue to a new location", etc.  The steps from Agenda to Fulfillment to new Agenda comprise the plot.<br/><br/>The Conflict is almost entirely divorced from the Agenda.  Don't confuse them.<br/><br/><br/>2.  The producer, based on the request, establishes the scene.  Probably briefly, but not necessarily so.<br/><br/><br/>3.  The players start playing their protagonists.  This could involve a wide variety of stances and techniques.<br/><br/><br/>4.  The first tricky part:  the potential for conflict is recognized.  This is probably, although not always, the character present with the highest Screen Presence finding something related to his Issue.  Note well:  this occurs *before* IIEE -- we are not even into Intent yet.  (This is just before Step 1 (pg 28) in the steps described in the PtA text.)<br/><br/><br/>5. "Stakes", which just means: how are the characters' Issues being expressed in this particular scene?  <br/><br/><br/>An example might be useful here:<br/><br/>Example scene from "Police Dudes":<br/>  Agenda: Biff and Angelo are investigating the murder scene of crime boss.<br/>  Established:  Dead body, blood everywhere.  Stacks of money on a table.<br/><br/>  Conflict for Biff:  Biff's Issue is Corruption and Greed -- "I want to be a good cop, but I really need the money."  The player recognizes this as an opportunity to press this Issue, and Biff has the higher screen presence.<br/>  Biff's crisis is:  "I should really just leave that money there and not take it... but I want to take it and pay for my mother's cancer treatments."<br/> <br/>  Conflict for Angelo:  Angelo's Issue is Trust -- "I want to trust my partner, but I want to avoid being betrayed again."<br/>  Angelo's crisis is:  "I should really trust Biff not to steal that money... but I want to keep an eye on him in case he's corrupt."<br/><br/><br/>With this approach, it can sometimes be a bit tricky to determine just which side of the Issue represents the protagonist 'winning'.  In general, we can think of it as what he wishes he would do, or what he thinks he should do.  Note that this is not the same as what we, the players, might wish or think he should do.  It's how he completes the statement "Right now, I should really..." in that moment.<br/><br/>Also note how all the Conflict here is unrelated to the Agenda.<br/><br/>These are Steps 1 and 2 from the PtA book, page 28.<br/><br/>"Action":  The text talks about how the protagonist is trying to get the stakes.  Don't do that yet.<br/><br/><br/>6.  Going to the cards.  Steps 3, 4, and 5 from the text, pages 29 and 30.  Most people understand this part, more or less.<br/><br/><br/>7.  Now things get tricky again.  This is Step 6 from the PtA book.  Through the cards, we now know how everyone came down with respect to their Issue, and we also know who "won narration".<br/><br/>So what actually happens now?  Let's start with what Fortune has done for us.<br/><br/>What the cards *actually* determined was nothing more or less than Intent, from our old friend IIEE.  *Everything* else -- Initiation, Execution, and Effect -- are up to the discretion of the person who won narrative authority.<br/><br/>Which still doesn't tell us what the players actually do.  There's a number of different approaches which have been observed:<br/><br/>1.  The Storyboard Approach:  The person who won narration authority tells the other players how the rest of the scene went, and the other players sit there and listen.  Then they move on to the next scene.<br/><br/>2.  The Act-It-Out Approach:  The person who won narration authority provides some broad hints to the other players about what happened.  The other players take those hints and resume play, similar to what they were doing before the recognition of conflict.  The player with narration authority may occasionally edit the other players in real time.<br/><br/>A person's preference for one approach or the other seems to be largely a matter of taste.  One mechanical advantage that the Act-It-Out Approach has is that it tends to offer a greater opportunity for the awarding of fanmail.<br/><br/>To return to our example:<br/>  The producer, Biff's player, and Angelo's player draw cards.  Possibly some other players kick in some fanmail.<br/>  The hands of the players are compared to the producer.  Let's say Biff loses (or, well, "loses") and Angelo "wins".  And someone wins narration authority; it's not terribly important who, for this example.<br/>  So we know that Biff's Intention is to steal the money, and Angelo's Intention is to trust Biff not to steal the money.<br/>  That's all we know.  The narrative authority has final approval on the details of Initiation, Execution, and Effect -- whether or not Biff even gets a chance to steal the money, how he steals the money, how much money he steals, if any.  Similarly,  the details of how Angelo exhibits his trust in Biff are also up to the narrative authority.  Does Angelo catch Biff stealing the money?  Maybe, maybe not.<br/><br/><br/>8.  No, we're not done yet.  We still haven't Fulfilled the Agenda.  <br/><br/>Fulfillment typically comes from:<br/><br/>A.  Whoever won narration rights, who makes it up out of whole cloth.<br/>B.  Whoever won narration rights, who asks, or is told, by the producer what the Fulfillment is or should be.<br/>C.  The producer provides it directly.<br/><br/>Note that in the special case where the producer wins narration rights, A and B collapse.  If scenes seem to run a lot better when the producer wins narration rights, this may be the reason.<br/><br/>At first blush, it may be tempting to object that B and C are nothing more than our old nemesis of railroading.  I would suggest this is not the case -- in the worst case, the producer providing Fulfillment is no more railroady than the producer providing Agenda.  In the best case, it is not railroading because it is not related to conflict -- the conflict, being Issue-based, is independent of Agenda and Fulfillment.<br/><br/>Failing to provide Fulfillment gives a very characteristic lurching, problematic quality to the plot.  It also tends to lead players to a desire to get the Agenda into the conflict so that there's some sense of plot movement.<br/><br/>It's probably better for the structure of the narrative to reveal the Fulfillment to the narration authority winner as soon as possible.  This allows the requisite plot to be woven into the Execution and Effect of the characters, rather than simply tacked on to the end of the scene.<br/><br/>To wrap up our example:  the producer tells the narration authority that there's a clue which leads them to a Chinatown restaurant.  That is incorporated into the narrative:  When Biff picks up (and takes) one of the bundles of cash, he notices that it's just a real bill on each end covering a stack of sliced-up paper.  Sliced-up Chinese menus, actually.  And off they go to the next scene...<br/><br/><br/><b>Interludes</b><br/><br/>Here's what PtA says about scenes:  "Most scenes should involve conflict."  So it's not technically a strict requirement for a scene.  Even so, I'd like to introduce a bit of terminology:<br/><br/>* Interlude Scene: A scene with no conflict.  Often shortened to "interlude".<br/>* Conflict Scene: A scene with conflict.  Often shortened to "scene".<br/><br/>Alright, that might be a bit confusing, but I think it makes sense in practice.  So we have episodes, which consist of interludes and scenes.<br/><br/>Interludes don't get much attention in PtA as written, but I think they can serve a handy purpose.<br/><br/>Interludes actually have the same requirements as all scenes: they have a focus (either protagonist or plot), an agenda, and a location.<br/><br/>So, if Interludes don't have conflict, what do they actually do?  They can have several purposes, depending on whether they are protagonist-focused or plot-focused.<br/><br/>A protagonist-focused interlude provides for one or both of:  Trait foreshadowing and establishment, or Fanmail collection.<br/><br/>Trait-foreshadowing scenes help provide some narrative integrity.  If an episode is going to make heavy use of some character's trait, like Retired Spy, it can be handy to have a scene that does nothing but remind the audience that he's a Retired Spy.  It can sometimes be jarring if he just starts using all these funky abilities in the middle of an episode.<br/><br/>Fanmail collection, or fanservice, is a ploy to make a character more engaging for the audience.  Is your hot college student taking a shower for no good reason?  This is the reason.  It's not all prurient, though -- a character just walking through a city, or sitting on a train, or sitting at a piano while quietly plinking away -- all these scenes can be for fanmail collection.<br/><br/>Plot-focused interludes generally relate to the agendas of future scenes or the fulfillment of recently-past scenes.  If a scene doesn't have any protagonists in it, it's almost certainly a plot-focused interlude.<br/><br/>Agenda interludes often don't have any protagonists, and they often occur at or near the beginning of an episode.  If an episode's plot is going to be about the protagonists solving a murder, then this is where we see that murder take place.  It establishes a starting point for a later conflict scene to have an Agenda like "The protagonists examine the murder scene for clues."<br/><br/>Fulfillment interludes are a trick that can be used intentionally or out of necessity.  Sometimes, for various reasons, a scene will end with the Agenda unfulfilled.  "Hey, did we actually manage to find any clues at that murder scene?"  This can be a quick fix for that -- "You get a call on your cellphone.  They found a receipt from a bar downtown on the victim."  This can also be set up intentionally.<br/><br/>I have two reasons for mentioning interludes at all:  for one, they are a feature of actual television shows, and thus deserve a place in the game.  Secondly, using them can improve the gameplay experience.  Some scenes don't have and don't need a conflict, and that's just fine.<br/><br/><br/><b>In Conclusion</b><br/><br/>Well, there you have it -- some notes, tricks, hacks, and drifts for Primetime Adventures.

I need a <b>lot </b>more help from the text to get me playing the way the author probably plays it with his groups.  <br/><br/>Your explanations help somewhat, or maybe they just highlight the bits that are problematic for me and my group.<br/><br/>The game says  <i>what </i>to do, or what <i>should </i>happen, but leaves you hanging with the <i>how</i>.<br/><br/>I think the main problem is trying to pace the game just like a tightly written TV show, where every scene and evry line has a purpose.  TV shows arent written in a few hours, they are drafted, redited and rewritten, but when your at the table playing an RPG you dont have that time and you constantly have to think 'meta' to try to get the right pacing... whats the agenda for the scene, wheres the conflict, etc...

It makes it a "Will I, won't I?" premise and I think questions tend to provide much more momentum to a game than statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe separation of Conflicts out of the scene-framing model might be splitting hairs though: if you say there's a pile of money on the table with all this blood around it, you are, to an extent, "explaining what the likely conflict is." It would be deeply strange and un-televsion-like if the conflict following that framing ignored those elements and was <i>only</i> concerned with whether the two lead characters' on-again, off-again romance could make any progress. Perhaps a better phrasing of the book's guidance would be that "[the agenda] <i>colours or informs</i> what the likely conflict is."  Regardless, it's still an intriguing analysis of how conflict scenes play out in PTA.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I like interludes: I want my drama to have cutaways to what the bad guys are doing, montages showing the characters preparing for what's to come or just exposition scenes where they remind us what's going and and hint at what might happen next.

Other people have tackled it elsewhere better than I can.<br/><br/>It may, however, be worth pointing out that a common character arc is:  The character himself begins by not realizing that his Issue is, well, much of an issue, because he doesn't see X and Y as mutually-exclusive, or believes that switching between them will be effective, or some other rational.  As the arc progresses and we see the character struggling with the Issue, he (often) eventually comes to see how problematic his Issue really is.  He then faces a difficult decision: which side of the dilemma to embrace, and which side to reject?  Then he has to turn his decision into a reality, which is rarely easy (and, technically, may constitute a new Issue for him.)  There are two main ways of resolving this particular character arc: on one hand, the character could succeed, and see a real change in himself and his life.  On the other hand, the character may come to realize that, for various reasons, he cannot or should not turn away from one or the other or both sides of the dilemma, and must continue to struggle along with it the best he can -- returning, in essence, to the status quo.<br/><br/><br/>I don't know -- is that accurate?

I think I might know what you're talking about here, Dave.  But I'll preface this by saying it's probably beyond the scope of what I want this document to be, so this is strictly an aside.<br/><br/>I think the question before us is:  should the players know they're playing Primetime Adventures?<br/><br/>If they do know they're playing Primetime Adventures -- in the sense of understanding the system -- then they know what Issue is supposed to do.  They're not going to be surprised by the Issue being problematic for the characters.<br/><br/>If they don't know they're playing Primetime Adventures -- or if they're just nominally-aware with no real understanding -- then they might not know what Issue is supposed to do.  They might well be surprised by the Issue being problematic for the characters.<br/><br/>In terms of the rules-as-written source text of the game, I think it's not particularly coy about what Issue is, and there's probably some expectation that the players are going into the game understanding what Issue is going to do and how it works.<br/><br/>Is the choice between these two approaches purely a matter of personal preference?  Perhaps.  I will say that I've found the second approach nearly impossible to achieve in any satisfying way.<br/><br/><br/>That's the general basis for what's going on here.  Very specifically to Primetime Adventures and Issue, I'll say this:<br/><br/>'Surprise', as a concept and emotion, has virtually nothing to do with fundamental addressing of Issue: not for the audience nor the authors, and not for the players nor the characters.  When it shows up, it shows up in the details of addressing Issue.<br/><br/>I'll return to one of my example Issues:  "I want to succeed at work, but that doesn't leave much time for me to be a good father"<br/><br/>There's nothing surprising there, for anyone.  Very very early on, in the pilot, perhaps, we may have this guy accepting a promotion and not realizing just how much time it'll take away from parenting.  So, alright, there might be a slight surprise there, but it's resolved very quickly.  And the usual way for this to play out is for at least one supporting character, and maybe all of them, to keep warning this guy that this is going to be an Issue.<br/><br/>All that being said, no one knows, at the outset, how this will play out.  We don't know if this guy will keep his promotion, or keep his job, or keep his family together.  He might get fired.  He might quit.  He might get divorced.  Heck, his whole family might even *die*, mid-season.  All those sorts of things can be legitimately surprising developments.<br/><br/>But there's also a completely illegitimate surprise.  I'll mention it only as a warning, that others might avoid it.  The surprise of "Wow, I thought it was going to be impossible for me to juggle my work and my family... but hey!  Surprise!  Turns out it's not that big of a deal."  That's just terrible all around, and I trust I need not linger on this any further.<br/><br/><br/>Now, it may well be that I've picked a poor example.  I'd be really interested to see an example of this done right -- of a good solid Issue where there really is surprise for someone involved.  <br/><br/><br/>Not sure if I quite got what you were getting to, Dave, but hopefully that's a start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344046/#Comment_344046" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T14:34:17+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  2:34PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2011 3:38PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me.  <br/><br/>I think I actually wandered a bit off-topic with my last few notes.

This probably belongs right in the front of this document.<br/><br/><br/><b>Pitching the Cast</b><br/><br/>I suggest introducing a new step between making the pitch and having the players work up their characters:  Pitching the Cast.  This is really more of an extension of the Pitch process rather than an entirely new step on its own.<br/><br/>The idea here is that the players, having received a tentative nod from the Producer towards their Pitch, then start pitching characters for the cast.  This, as before, is a brainstorming process.  The characters suggested are not necessarily player-characters, and are not really property of the player who suggests them.  The Producer has a similar role here insofar as approving some characters and rejecting others.<br/><br/>Among the advantages to using this process:<br/><br/>*  Every once in a while, a strong Pitch will be approved, but the cast of characters is just sort of flat, with no one that any player really wants to play.  This gives everyone a chance to catch that, and go back to the drawing board in the search for a better Pitch.<br/><br/>*  It gives the Producer and the rest of the players a good opportunity to really firm up the tone, genre, and expectations for the show.  When someone pitches "a plucky young girl who occasionally helps out the team with her freakishly-advanced computer skills" then we learn a lot from the Producer (and the other players) either accepting that, or rejecting her, as a valid character.  Is a main character being deeply addicted to drugs too grim for this show?  Is the President of the United States well beyond the scope of our episodes?  It really helps everyone get onto the same page.<br/><br/>*  The players get a wider range of characters to choose from, and hence are more likely to get a really interesting character.  Interestingly, once the cast starts to form up, the players might shift their ideas substantially about what sort of character they want.  It may well be that they find themselves a lot less interested in Batman, Spider-man, and Superman, and much more interested in Commissioner Gordon, Aunt May, and Jimmy Olsen.<br/><br/>*  The Producer ends up with a whole stable of characters to use.  Like closet space, you always end up needing more characters than you first think.  A long-running series like The Simpsons has a truly epic roster of characters.  You probably don't need quite that many, but having a good handful to start with makes the Producer's job a lot easier.<br/><br/><br/>As I've already alluded to, once everyone is happy with the number of characters generated and the established tone of the series, they should proceed along to the "character generation" steps detailed in the PtA text.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344235/#Comment_344235" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T09:49:29+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  9:49AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a genius extended Pitch step Roger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344245/#Comment_344245" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T11:16:10+00:00" title="September 28, 2011 11:16AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought that was how the book already said to do it?

Yes, it may be bad drama, and certainly it would be bad TV, but I've observed many times that players of PTA often want to kick at the wheels of drama.  PTA has a very strong do-it-yourself vibe, it many times attracts people who are dissatisfied with TV storytelling or feel the outlines of drama are too artificial.  (Roleplaying in general attracts these people as well.)  So I think an answer to the issue of family vs. work that's "it's easier than I thought under circumstances X, Y and Z" is a legitimate answer that shouldn't be avoided if that's where the players want to go with it.<br/><br/>In such a circumstance, it is better to think of that character as a supporting character (whatever their Screen Presence) - as their Issue is resolved without dramatic choice, just with an exploration of circumstance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344249/#Comment_344249" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T11:42:51+00:00" title="September 28, 2011 11:42AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a good point, Jason.  And it marks out an important omission on my part:  I haven't talked about my target audience yet.<br/><br/><br/>Unlike a lot of 'hacks' books, this isn't primarily for the player or group who is already having a really positive experience with PtA, and who is looking to squeeze a bit more out of it.  I mean, hey, they should still feel free to peruse it and steal anything that they think looks useful.  But they can freely ignore anything that seems shaky.<br/><br/>The primary audience is those people who have tried to play PtA 'by the book' and who have had severe problems with it.  Where the rules have given players enough rope to hang themselves with, I've tried to add additional constraints and guidance.  Yes, that pitfall-ridden quagmire over there is still an interesting area to explore -- but let's get you some experience running in the flowering meadows, first.<br/><br/><br/>That also applies to what a lot of what David has been saying too, although I hadn't realized it.  It helps explain why I've had this strange sensation of "Okay I totally agree with this guy and what he's saying... so why am I advocating the opposite?"

I've tried multiple methods and nothing's perfect.<br/><br/>About preplanned story arcs: One thought I've had is to use Game of Thrones as an example.  Yes, it looks like Sansa is going to marry Jeoffrey and Bran is going to have awesome adventures as castle climbing boy, but things don't work out that way.  You see that all the time in TV series, where an expectation is set up, then subverted.  The boy gets the girl to go out with him, but it ends badly and they're further apart than when they started.How to do that in PTA?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344537/#Comment_344537" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T12:37:38+00:00" title="September 30, 2011 12:37PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Subvert expectations via good counter-stakes!<br/><br/>Roger, I'm curious about whether, in your Step 8, you'd consider mentioning other possibilities, like "high card narrator takes suggestions from the whole table".  Or perhaps that violates your desire to accord with the rules as written?  I have always found PtA most fun when counter-stakes were set <i>before</i> the card draw.  I've been told that disincentivizes playing to win narration, which made sense to me, but I don't think it applies any more than in "ask the producer" which you do list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344670/#Comment_344670" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T21:28:46+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  9:28PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Danny,<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to say about fulfilling Agenda.  It's sort of PtA's encumbrance-tracking -- usually about the best you can do is make sure it doesn't get in the way of the important stuff.  But if you have a more specific problem, let's hear it.<br/><br/>Game of Thrones is sort of an interesting example.  For the most part, I think the characters don't have Issues per se.  It's not like Ned Stark is ever going to not do whatever his duty requires.  There are a few exceptions; I can imagine a PtA series up on The Wall, for example.<br/><br/>Generally, sure, you can subvert expectations.  You can have House figure out the disease in the first scene, or never figure it out and then the patient dies.  The two buddy cops can investigate a murder and then never figure out who did it.  It's not technically difficult, if that's really what you want to do.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344672/#Comment_344672" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T21:51:49+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  9:51PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, David.  Just to recap for everyone, Step 8 is when the Agenda is fulfilled.  So, yeah, it can definitely work to solicit suggestions from the table.  "Hey gang, what's the next disease that the House team should incorrectly guess?  Leprosy?  Hysterical pregnancy?  Tragic oxygen allergy?  All good suggestions."  But it's purely Colour, of course -- there's no chance they'll figure it out for reals in the early scenes, nor fail to figure it out near the final scene.<br/><br/>That kinda superficially looks like "stakes", but I prefer to keep that term closer in relevance to the various Issues.<br/><br/>Hopefully that answers your question.  I should probably mention suggestions as a subtype of resolving Step 8, so thanks for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344696/#Comment_344696" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-02T11:59:02+00:00" title="October  2, 2011 11:59AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, when I played with suggestions, the intent wasn't just color that was merely, uh, colorful; it was for situation-fodder.
