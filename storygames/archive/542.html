I'm scheduled to run a couple of one-shot LARP demos in may and june, and I'm curious.                </div>

                            Seems to me the only big issue would be everyone remembering the phrases. <br/><br/>If you could manage that, it ought to be fine.<br/><br/>Maybe you would need to reduce the number a bit? I'm not sure which ones should (or even could) be removed, however.<br/><br/>It seems like a really promising way to go for a LARP mechanic.                        </div>

<p>I dunno.</p>
<p>From what I understand, larps are traditionally large and messy, right?</p>
<p>Polaris's conflict phrases are large and messy too:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>El Nasl falls down the well.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p><em>But only if</em> Rukbat and Nair's relationship is broken apart by betrayal on both sides.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>How much of this can a game support at one time? The amount of information you can produce in a single conflict is huge, and you'd be badly burdened by trying to communicate this to discontinuous groups of people.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> Another way to put this is, the conflict rules are specifically calibrated to work for the conflict of two equals who have authority over several subordinates. When you start putting too many people on even ground, I think it would probably go to hell.</p>

                            Although LARPs are large and messy, usually conflicts are (in my experience) only between two people of maybe two small groups.<br/><br/>You might need to limit what can be established in conflict, such as to areas that each character has control over (I guess this would be your stats?)<br/><br/>E.g. If George is the king, maybe he can say "But only if the nation goes to war." If he is a street urchin, he'd have to say "But only if you get knifed in the gut" instead.                        </div>

<p>I just stuck this up on my journal; I'll copy it here.</p>
<p>To initiate a conflict, you open with the words "How about...", in character. And then there are bargaining phrases you use, say, a dozen of them. A bargain is sealed with the phrase "Why don't we find out?" or cancelled with "Never going to happen", followed by playing out the scene.</p>
<p>So, I step up to you...</p>
<p>"<em>How about</em> I beat your ass into the ground, drag you off to see the boss."<br/>
(I've just picked a fight, and told you how I want it to end).</p>
<p>"<em>I expect</em> if you tried that, you'd be one hurting boy for the rest of the night; easy for anyone to kick around."<br/>
(You've told me the cost to me to get the result I want - I have to play hurt for the night, and lose fights easily).</p>
<p>"<em>Never going to happen.</em> Why don't you just come along and see the boss peaceably?<br/>
(I've negated the deal, and simply asked the other to come along peacably).</p>
<p>See any potential?</p>

                            I think so. I'm wary of having a dozen or so phrases - I think the ideal would be:<br/><br/>1. Initiate conflict ("How about...")<br/>2. Accept what you have ("That's right" or something like that?)<br/>3. Accept with additional rider ("But only if..." - I think this works better than "I expect that...")<br/>4. Throw everything away completely ("Never going to happen"), which allows you to initiate a new conflict, of course.<br/><br/>That keeps it simple. Of course, you may not want it that simple... it depends a lot on what each character has in the way of stats. My own experience has been in low impact LARPs, in which the system I just outlined might well work. More complexity in the phrases would probably need to be reflected in character stats.<br/><br/>That system also has no cost associated with rejecting a conflict, which is likely to be required. Maybe each character has a limited number of total rejections they can claim? Perhaps start with two or three and gain a new one each time you give (just accept the other terms) in a conflict?                        </div>

                            The inherent downside of rejection is that if you regularly reject things, you get cut out of the loop - people just don't get into conflict with you.<br/>
<br/>
That's a pretty negative chain, though.  Needing to get / spend rejections might work better, in that it would provide currency for the game.                        </div>

                            Keep in mind the restrictions of narration in larp.  The thing that makes larp different from tabletop is that other players aren't necessarily going to hear what happens in the narrated conflict.  I've seen a few parlor larps deal with this by having everyone freeze and pay attention when a conflict or combat happens, but it's tricky.  <br/>
<br/>
So you need to restrict what can be narrated, or you'll have trouble conveying what happened to all the other players.  Larp narration should usually be limited to only things which directly affect the two people in conflict.  <br/>
<br/>
The other issue is time.  If not everything stops for the conflict, then you've got other stuff going on without know how this resolves.  Thus, I think it's very important that the conflict resolve quickly.                        </div>

                            Another problem is any negotiation that involves a future state of the game. "But only if you die in the baron's arms" doesn't work well if you go looking for the Baron only to find he has been deposed or killed. You can't play with time in LARP the way you can in Polaris.                        </div>
