I think there might be a distinction between in-setting-consequences and in-story consequences. An example would help:<br/><br/>Suppose you're doing Aeon-Flux/Mr.Bill setup where the setting reboots at the end of each scene. Let's say you had a really sad scene last time, and a player wants the next scene to be a happy story. In one sense, this is a "lasting consequence" - the fact that the scene was sad last time had the "consequence" of having a happier scene this time. There might be no in-setting consequences (Aeon Flux is alive instead of dead, the super bio-death weapon released at the end of the last scene no longer exists, etc.) but there are in-story consequences (We had a sad scene, so it's time to do something more upbeat) Another example of in-story but not in-setting would be in the first scene we revealed the hero was so afraid of heights that she lost her grip while climbing and fell to her death; in a second scene we reveal the hero loves another Character Bob. Motivated by the first two scenes, a player might propose In the third scene we might explore whether she would risk coming up to a cliff to save Bob. (is her fear stronger than her love?) Story consequences (the details of the first scenes influence where the group decide to take the story in future scenes), even with no setting consequences (setting resets after every scene)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111650/#Comment_111650" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T12:19:18+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 12:19PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't expect "consequence" to be such a touchy-feely term, but I'm glad it turned out that way, because that idea is full of some awesome, William.<br/><br/>I've noted the gist of it down in my notebook for Know Thyself.  To muddy the water with the terms I'd use here (as "consequence" is being used for several different things, making the meaning unclear), I'd call your idea a "tonal impact" in a "thread of stories," rather than what I was referring to before -- a "factual impact" in a single story.<br/><br/>The reason I don't use "setting" here is because the problem I'm unpacking is devoid of setting.  There is a meta-setting of "this is what your mind is going through as you travel through time," but then a scene's setting is constructed over again every time there's a new scene.  It's different from what you're talking about, where you're definitely re-using established elements over and over and, uh, I may and may not be.<br/><br/>To step back to the original premise for a moment:\n<blockquote>A game requires by assumption that there be lasting consequences.</blockquote>\nIt begins to sound like, for some definition of "consequence," this is true.  I will avoid the "the game impacts ourselves because we react to it" element and stick strictly to some variant of "consequence in narrative, whether mechanical or not," because that's not what I'm trying to unpack (and I'm unsure if that's unavoidable anyway -- but it's a different cow).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111675/#Comment_111675" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T13:05:57+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  1:05PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another concept I was thinking of but not sure what kind of consequence it is, or even if it was one, was players learning about a "setting" or "characters".<br/><br/>For example, think of Aeon Flux again, and the point of each scene is to explore/create different aspects of Aeon's character by putting her through different situations, and then resetting after each scene. The character, in the fiction, isn't changing, but player's understanding of the character is changing.<br/><br/>Why would you do this? Well in a "normal" game, you have a kind of Heisenberg Uncertainty principal going on, where every scene you do to learn about the character also changes the character. For example, there's a difference between:<br/><br/>A:<br/>Scene 1: Character's Family is killed<br/>Scene 2: Character's Dog is killed<br/><br/>and <br/><br/>B:<br/>Scene 1: Character's Dog is killed<br/>Scene 2: Character's Family is killed<br/><br/>What happens in the first scene would, in a "normal" game, change what happens in the second scene. A normal game can only give you the experiences A1 followed by A2 or B1 followed by B2, but never both. But maybe as a player you want to experience A1 and B1. So you want resets. Sometimes you don't want to know how a character changes... sometimes you want to know who a character is, right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112020/#Comment_112020" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T11:39:43+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 11:39AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you're trying to kill a cow which moos something like this:<br/>"A game must have events which leads to lasting results, which in turn become events that promote further results."<br/>-or-<br/>"Events in a game must have persistence and must causally impact future events."<br/><br/>That might be the Armored Cow of Doom--can we call the very definition of a term ("game") a sacred cow?<br/><br/>(Head starting to ache... veins popping... eyes roving wildly....)<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112031/#Comment_112031" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T12:14:46+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 12:14PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's exactly the cow I'm trying to evaluate, and while I don't believe that the definition of a game is involved, I suspect the habits of a good game are after this discussion and my own experimenting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112055/#Comment_112055" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T12:51:53+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 12:51PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, put another way, "the habit of building a coherent narrative to drive a good game is involved."<br/><br/>I figure, if you lose causality in the narrative, you get incoherent stories of the Aeon Flux, Mr. Bill, Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers variety.

This is separate from the Aeon Flux-style, where everything, including the mindstates of all characters, is rebooted.  (That is, if I understand that correctly.)<br/><br/>Now, one could say "dude, Ryan, that mindstate is proof of lasting consequence!" except that, in play, I have found that in my game the complete new information tends to override the old, because as play progresses the players are focused on the here-and-now, so while perhaps the character is dealing with this shit, the player is only barely sharing that mindstate while being bombarded with the newly introduced game elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112129/#Comment_112129" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T14:47:46+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  2:47PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well, I interpreted the definition as no "lasting" consequences, and I've been implicitly thinking of "lasting" as "past the current scene" or about "15 minutes of play"<br/><br/>However, there is another, related kinda of cow:<br/><br/>"Decisions in how to play a game should be based off 1) internal logical consequence of the narrative 2) needs of a "good story" 3) random elements, and (1) should always play at least some part."<br/><br/>In other words, there's a cow that says it's "wrong" for any given player to completely and utterly disregard internal logical consequence when altering elements of the game's sharedImaginedSpace/Narrative/PickFavoriteJargon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112132/#Comment_112132" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T14:55:59+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  2:55PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I actually find an Aeon-Flux style idea kinda interesting for exploring a Canon character in a fanfiction like way. That is, suppose I have my favorite canon character that I want to play. But if I play her in a sufficiently long campaign, the campaign events will change her, so she'll no longer be the "same" character, the one I wanted to play. Once that happens, I might want to "reboot" the character so I can go back to playing my favorite character. Same thing might happen with the setting. I might start off with my favorite setting, but the setting changes with time, until it is no longer my favorite setting. So a reboot is in order.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the scheme might help me explore material I might otherwise avoid. I might be interested in how the character faces death, without then being forced to retire the character if she dies in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
