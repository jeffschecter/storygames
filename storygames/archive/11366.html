The "addictive escape behaviors" makes sense, and "fantasy roleplaying" is pretty much the name of the game, but gambling?

They don't understand what the game is, but they hear vague reports of gangs and gambling and dangerous power dynamics. Given that their primary responsibility is to prevent that sort of stuff, it's easiest to just ban it.<br/><br/>The way to resolve that would be gamer prison outreach - going to prisons to run and promote games in a way that made prison officials less wary.<br/><br/>But there's lot's of demands for our charitable efforts. Even if we restrict it to gaming-related efforts, there's at-risk kids and low-income kids and recovering military vets, all of whom could use some charitable gaming outreach.

I could see <i>Amber</i> taking off like a shot among prisoners denied access to splatbooks and such, because at that point play becomes little more than standing around talking.

There's probably some really interesting potential edge cases.</blockquote>\nI participated in process drama based on a similar Japanese folk tale as the Mountain Witch Rpg, created and facilitated by <a href="http://www.chester.ac.uk/departments/education/staff/allan-owens" rel="nofollow">Allan Owens</a>, as a part of my drama education studies. Owens mentioned that he uses that particular process drama as a part of applied drama workshops he runs at youth (or was it female) prisons in England. <br/><br/>Process drama has lots in common with JeepForm, but with more emphasis on creative and performance groupwork. The important decision points in the story are also often highlighted by first grounding and exploring different viewpoints and then using some technique to put the participants in the center of the decision-making process. So, like role-playing, but with different techniques to allow larger groups to provide creative input and viewpoints (in forms of stagings of parts of the story etc.) and participate in important decision points together.<br/><br/>To drift further apart from the topic (sorry!) me and my friend run a workshop of using role-playing techniques last week in experiential education in a national experiential (outdoor) education seminar. We heard a lot of inspiring stories and ideas, including some about exploring bullying in schools through role-playing.<br/><br/>Our focus was in using role-playing games to explore different social problems, situations and different kinds of social roles in a safe non-serious setting. This is something I'd like to explore more. The first thing to do is to play more games with these kinds of intentions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253507/#Comment_253507" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T12:54:08+00:00" title="January 28, 2010 12:54PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://thebookpolice.blogspot.com/2010/01/why-prison-d-ban-makes-sense.html" rel="nofollow">An interesting blog entry</a> from someone who appears to be involved in prison outreach.<br/><br/>(My thanks to a poster over at NerdNYC.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
