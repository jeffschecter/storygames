I thought that was an interesting thing to think about.  I like Flyover a lot, but it wasn't obvious why it clicks with me more than similar playsets (Main Street, Tales From Suburbia, and Last Frontier all seem kinda similar).  Here's what I wrote over there:<br/>\n<blockquote>Short answer: because Marcy Lowell is such a bitch.<br/><br/>Longer answer: I've actually never played Main Street, but I have played Tales from Suburbia. And it was a good game. But those playsets felt a little bit more generic. Flyover has a little more material in there to spur on the imagination. The flyover playset has little narrative threads that run through the various elements, that let you take them and build things. So Marcy Lowell shows up in a lot of games of Flyover, and she's always terrible in beautiful, awful ways. And the airport is always involved in smuggling or drug dealing or something. Or the Mexican drug dealers and the tear stained letter written in badly broken Spanish...<br/><br/>Flyover also gives you a small town setting. Everyone knows each other, at least a little. The small town setting means that there's plenty of isolated spots and abandoned run down barns to hide your meth labs in. But it's not the crazy isolation of The Ice (another great playset), so you can still go into town and have a shootout in the community health center or whatever. I can picture Flyover country in my head and spin out cool specific details real quickly and easily without them feeling like I'm just using stock, generic settings.<br/><br/>Of course, Flyover is also the first playset that I played, so maybe it's a mental reaction to the discovery of something new. It's also the playset I've played the most (five or six times at least) which may also relate to my liking it.<br/><br/>Flyover has never failed to give me a great setup and an entertaining game.</blockquote>\nSo the question is... Which is your favorite playset?  What makes it a better playset than all others?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397186/#Comment_397186" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-12T06:53:44+00:00" title="November 12, 2012  6:53AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Flyover is also my favorite playset, for many of the same reasons.

I've played too much to make a decision, it would seem. I've demoed it or played it at every con I've attended since its release (and at one con, pre-release). I'm not entirely sure which I've played more than once; and I'm not sure which I'd choose if given total free rein.<br/><br/>*Probably* <i>Vegas, Baby!</i> or <i>Lucky Strike</i>, because they are so instantly comprehensible to most folks. Everyone's seen a Rat Pack movie or any one of a host of modern caper/mob movies; and everyone's seen war films or M*A*S*H (inaccurate mental concepts that are at least internally consistent are sufficient for my play!). And <i>The Ice</i> has this sort of splendid isolation (without being, like, one-cabin-style isolation) that I think helps create a sort of austerity in play--but maybe I've just seen The Thing too often and use it to inform my mental models instead of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mcmurdo+station&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch" rel="nofollow">more-accurate sources like actual photos</a>.<br/><br/>[Aside: I think <i>Nice Southern Town</i> is my least favorite, because I'm southern and, at larger cons, I play with non-southerners. It can get... insulting? petty? stereotyical?... pretty quick.

I actually think that this is how roleplaying games should be written. But I also think it's important to see what the playsets really are. In my point of view: coulisses. And that's why I think the playsets work. Because they can be "locked in" to the game structure without any hassle.<br/><br/>Lets talk about structures. All games has structures. The most common one is game mechanics, which are procedures that you follow. Fiasco has a game play structure: a procedure for how you advance the game. If you were going to start the game with the tilt, the game would have a different structure and probably render a totally different game.<br/><br/>Now, if I like the structure of the game - especially a game play structure as in Fiasco - it doesn't really matter what kind of setting I'm playing in. I know that I will have a good time (if we also consider that I'm accompanied with good participants, of course).<br/><br/>So what does the playbooks do? Are they totally pointless? No, because what they do is to plant a thought into the participants' minds - a common theme that changes how they interpret the elements in the game. We have this in other games as well. In Apocalypse World, when you create fronts, you decide which scarcity that you will use which will colour the entire session. A drooling monster is treated really differently in a game master's mind depending if the scarcity is hunger, envy or decay.<br/><br/>That's why I say that you can play Japanese school girls as a theme in all the playsets and it will work with 95% of all the <i>results in the</i> tables. The tables will decide if it's going to be social realism, drugs or supernatural elements, but they will still be about Japanese school girls.<br/><br/>[edit] added "as a theme" in the above paragraph.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397630/#Comment_397630" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T14:10:46+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  2:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's why I say that you can play Japanese school girls in all the playsets and it will work with 95% of all the <i>results in the</i> tables.

But that's no different than saying "Hey, let's play D&amp;D/VtM except everyone's a Japanese school girl." That's basically a drift of theme or a hack of the setting.<br/><br/>[...

If the playset doesn't matter, than playing with this playset will be no better than playing "Japanese school girls" with some other playset. My hypothesis is that you'd discover the opposite, over repeated runs of the experiment.<br/><br/>I think saying that "<i>it is possible</i> to play Japanese school girls with any playset" is not at all the same as saying "playsets don't matter".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
