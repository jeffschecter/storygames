You'd think with the billions of dollars that industry rakes in, some coin might slip between the booth babes and the coke parties into the hands of researchers who have somehow managed <i>not</i> to cover both their eyes and ears at the same time while screaming "LALALA" so as to block out the world around them.<br/><br/><a href="http://gamestudies.org/0701/articles/simons" rel="nofollow">But no.</a>\n<blockquote>[...]but rather because to an external observer it often becomes obvious that the courses of action open to the player are scripted into the design of the game. Michael Mateas, for instance, notices:<br/><br/>By watching many players interact with the system, the observer has begun to discern the devices that control the plot in the face of player interaction. This observer will conclude that the player has no true agency, that <b>the player is not able to form any intentions within the dramatic world that actually matter</b>. But the first-time player within the world is experiencing agency. The designer of the dramatic world could conclude - because they are designing the world for the player, not for the observer - that <b>as long as the player experiences a true sense of interactive freedom (that is agency) transformation as variety is not an important design consideration</b> (Mateas, 2004).<br/><br/>The trick of the trade of game design is indeed to <b>make the player believe she is in control</b>. Moreover, as Lisbeth Klastrup argues, performances by players in interaction with each other and virtual gameworlds give rise to \u201ctellable events,\u201d \u201cwhich would retrospectively make good stories\u201d (Klastrup, 2003).</blockquote>\n(emphasis mine) So the primary measure of worth in a game is player immersion, and "the trick of the trade in game design" is illusionism?

In a nutshell, our conclusion was that the more options given us in the guise of sandbox play, the less immersed we are, and the less "real" the world becomes. Videogaming's attempt to broaden its' horizons have, I believe, effectively limited it as a storytelling mechanism.<br/><br/>My last D&amp;D experience ended abruptly with the DM/storywriter suddenly deciding that Neverwinter Nights 2 was a far superior experience than tabletop, because he could keep the players on rails and wouldn't have to be in the same room with everyone who played. I (and everyone else) told him that freeflowing play and drinking beer together were two of our main reasons for showing up; his story was a close third, but not our primary motivation. I think experiences like these are becoming more and more common.<br/><br/>Videogames are linear stories, in my eyes; any sidetracking involved would be akin to a voluntary subplot, a side-story which, like those in comic books, may be skipped if it's deemed appropriate. Approaching them from a cinematic perspective, they are remarkably open-ended. Approaching from a roleplaying perspective, they are irrepairably crippled by the natural limitations of computer gaming, i.e. nonimprovisational play. Mass Effect demonstrates this pretty well, and I think which observational stance reviewers have taken has drastically affected their overall views on the game, and proceeding games like it.<br/><br/>As a cinema buff, I look forward to games with driving narratives and powerful stories. As a roleplaying, I'm thinking roleplaying's going to be my primary outlet for improvisational/collaborative storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143756/#Comment_143756" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T13:21:24+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  1:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the issue I have is that really, you can't expect the same things of video game design as you can from game design inspired by the Big Model.<br/><br/>you're conflating tabletop game design with video game design even though they very clearly are different things altogether. Calling game researchers ignorant because they don't try and adapt a different field's efforts to their own simply isn't true. I mean, if you want emergent storytelling in video games, play the Sims or Civilization or other games where you have a god view. It's just absurd to expect the same narrative freedom when playing a game someone hundreds of miles designed entirely in advance, without ever having met you.<br/><br/>P.S.

Since our budgets are finite, there's only so much freedom we can give the player. So the illusion of freedom is generally the best that we can do (if we want to turn a profit and keep our jobs).<br/><br/>Of course, linearity is not a binary condition; it's a range. On the one hand, you've got tightly scripted games like Half-Life 2, and on the other, you've got open-ended exploration like Morrowind (which I've been playing off-and-on for about five years, with a total of over 400 hours logged thus far). You can't say that video game narrative is linear, because you haven't defined your terms. You can say that game X is more linear than game Y, or that game Z is relatively non-linear for a first-person shooter.<br/><br/>It's also important to remember that the study of games doesn't really have much to do with the process of video game development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143766/#Comment_143766" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T13:54:28+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  1:54PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're not at all ignorant of the limitations they place into games, and would gladly (I think) give players such agency.

Certainly those of us who believe in free will would be inclined to disagree, however I believe that this is part of the willing suspension of disbelief that any good piece of storytelling will engender. When I play a video game, any video game, <em>of course</em> I know that I can't literally do anything, but if I can be lead to forget that fact in the heat of the moment, and the game responds appropriately to all the things I actually want to do, then the developers have done a superior job.<br/><br/>Mateas &amp; Klastrup are both talking specifically about videogames here, and those quotes are both ~5 years old at this point. I'm sure if you emailed them and asked about non-electronic rpgs or storygames in particular, they wouldn't say anything of the sort.<br/><br/><strong>Re: Storytron</strong> Chris Crawford will not revolutionize gaming.

I'm using the word 'stories' to mean some information that may apply to real life at some point (before anyone points out it's about fantasy dwarves, I'll say Aesops fables were about talking animals - they still contained life lessons).<br/><br/>I think your spot on about them focusing on illusionism. But hell, that's been table top RPG's supposed 'cutting edge' as well for quite some time. Don't be too harsh on them for doing what overall table top RPG design is only just slightly starting to avoid.<br/><br/>Back on dwarf fortress, I think there are two key factors:<br/>1. The player is out to achieve something himself - a relatively stable dwarf fortress (they may also have a themed fortress in mind, but there's no point to that if it's not stable and zombie elephants kill everyone and destroy it).<br/>2. The dwarves run on their own simple AI scripts (as designed by the author). Most of the stories I've heard in dwarf fortress come from when a dwarf went bonkers and did something - and it turned out quite interesting.<br/><br/>I think these AI routines represent the author, in a way, as if you were playing with him (certainly his desire for dwarves to go bonkers fairly often seems fully represented). I think this allows the hybridisation of how he'd like things and how you the player would like things. This is how I see the fundimental of alot of table top - it's the hybridisation of ideas and events.<br/><br/>Or to put it more simply, having characters which you can influence but not directly control (and which have quite strong personalities of their own), was a great idea on his part and should be further explored. Actually, the sims is like that a bit as well, isn't it (never played the sims, myself).<br/><br/><br/>BTW, Iachek - that's the lamp store guy in nethack, right?

Half-Life, for example, is a game where providing greater control of narrative to the player would be an entirely unnecessary complication - the gameplay revolves around shooting stuff and figuring out levels, with an unfolding linear story being icing on the cake. The adventure game genre (frequently excluding interactive fiction - I'm thinking games like Monkey Island) focuses on solving puzzles while experiencing a carefully crafted storyline, as if you were reading a book where you have to solve a Sudoku puzzle to get to the next chapter. Giving the player control over that story would contradict all the work which went into crafting it. Similarly with JRPGs such as Final Fantasy and Xenogears/Xenosaga, with the puzzle being a turn-based tactical combat sequence.<br/><br/>None of the games I just mentioned tries to trick the player into believing they have agency. Half-Life is a shooter and makes no apologies for it. Monkey Island is a puzzle solving game. JRPGs have adopted a more and more tightly focused storyline over the years, with my latest experience - Final Fantasy Crisis Core - being exactly nothing other than a string of auto-balanced combat sequences with occasional cinematic cutscenes.<br/><br/>What disturbed me about the passage I quoted was the notion of "tricking" the player into believing they had control of the game's narrative, that GTA4's missions were dynamically generated based on your relative rep with the various gangs or that TES4: Oblivion's NPCs actually were equipped with some sort of true AI rather than elaborate scripts (don't quote Turing at me - there <i>is</i> a difference).<br/><br/>In particular, what disturbed me was that it was phrased as a general goal of all storytelling video-games, "the trick of the trade", when it's clearly just smoke and mirrors - and clumsy, awkward ones at that. It becomes painfully obvious, if not immediately then on a second play-through or when discussed with friends, that any choice will yield the same result. Compare, if you will, to a GM who runs the same con scenario year after year and it always turns out the same - how will you feel when discussing it with another player, hearing that all options yield the same result? Realizing you were tricked into believing you had agency, when in actuality you were played like a fiddle, is terrible - in whichever medium.<br/><br/>Here's where I would hope that academics - you know, people who think and write about this stuff for a living - would have learned something from other types of games, like ours, where the idea of an illusionist, railroading GM (by whichever name you call them and by whichever theory you subscribe to) is nearly universally loathed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143868/#Comment_143868" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T05:30:01+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  5:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 5:37AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again... what would you have them do? Set aside the financial incentives that cause the status quo for a moment, and let's say that they believed that making a better mousetrap would generate even more revenue than current models (or they're just doing it out of the goodness of their hearts). And they wanted to try to do what you're asking. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have tried, and nobody has been able to come close. It's not a matter of the limitations of memory, any "scripting" is going to come off as scripting, no matter how elaborate. The true limitation there is simply the time involved. You can only script a game at a certain rate, even if you have an unlimited budget. Which, of course, nobody has. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a technological limitation. Nobody has yet created the sort of AI that replicates the ability of a GM to facilitate play, yet at the same time allow for the player to take play in a direction of their choosing. Storytron represents, if it's successful (and it may well not be by many definitions), one small step in the direction in question. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it isn't the sort of technology that you can obtain simply by throwing money at the problem. The Manhattan Project was expensive, surely, but the limitations on the work come down to the power of the minds that could be assembled and brought to bear, only certain of them being key to the whole thing. The other folks paid may have been smart, and a neccessary component of putting it all together, just as a CRPG design team is composed of many team players each doing their part. But what sets one apart from another, and what's required to make a leap forward in technology, is vision. And very few people in the world have vision. You can't pay a person to have vision. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then... Chris Crawford has vision, and is following it. But he may not succeed. It often takes generations of visionaries working on each other's small advancements, before we really see a change in technologies. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo don't hold your breath. Even if we had unlimited budgets, and unlimited computing power for the player, we still wouldn't know how to make the sort of game that you're asking for. We've also known for decades that Fusion power will, when it is available, revolutionize the world in terms of providing cheap energy. That knowledge hasn't hastened the day of it's arrival. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoney in that direction doesn't hurt, of course... we might find more visionaries, or at least make the existing ones have less concerns about their mortgages. But just like the money sunk into Fusion research, there's no proof anywhere that it will eventually be successful, nor anyone who can accurately predict when it will arrive. And until we can know those things, there's no way we can expect this technology to come any sooner. <br/>\n<br/>\nWishing it were here will not make it so. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. if I had to choose between two technologies that I'd like to see, Fusion and "Real Gaming AI" I'd choose fusion. I'm not so greedy that I'd want to deny the rest of the world the prosperity that fusion will bring about. And, besides, when we're all able to fly to see each other in person for next to nothing, we can all just tabletop together. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be closer than you think: http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1364/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143883/#Comment_143883" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T06:10:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  6:10AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 6:41AM by Rafael.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Realizing you were tricked into believing you had agency, when in actuality you were played like a fiddle, is terrible - in whichever medium.</blockquote>\nWell, you've just described every linear shooter (such as Half-Life 2 or Halo 3) that I've ever played. These games offer very little agency (your choice usually comes down to selecting between a few weapons, or choosing to wait a few minutes before moving through the door in front of you), but they use elements like fake doors and dead-end corridors to give you the impression that there's a world around you. If you study the top-down maps, however, you'll see that these games are completely linear and devoid of options. You have to go here, then you have to open this door, then you have to fight this particular character in order to progress. And that's fine, provided that it's handled with finesse. This isn't as much fun in a tabletop game, mostly because the production-value elements (sound, visuals) are sorely lacking by comparison. And, of coures, because in a tabletop game, part of the appeal is the ability to do anything, go anywhere. In a video game, the presence of a helicopter requires a lot of work from artists, programmers, designers, testers, and producers. In a tabletop game, the presence of a helicopter requires nothing but a few words spoken by one of the participants. Tabletop games afford a considerably greater level of freedom.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Here's where I would hope that academics - you know, people who think and write about this stuff for a living - would have learned something from other types of games, like ours, where the idea of an illusionist, railroading GM (by whichever name you call them and by whichever theory you subscribe to) is nearly universally loathed.</blockquote>\nAnother thing to consider is that it's pretty well-known that certain video games are tightly scripted and completely linear (Halo 3 and GRAW, for example). Fans of such games don't care, and the millions of copies sold are testament to this fact. Other games, like Morrowind and (to a considerably lesser extent) GTA4 offer the player more latitude. Sales are good on both sides of the equation. So it's not as though video game enthusiasts are tired of illusionism and railroading (despite being aware of the other possibilities that are out there).<br/><br/>EDIT: Shameless plug. In my book, <i>The Game Writing Handbook</i>, I define these two narrative approaches as logocentric (developer-authored) and mythocentric (player-authored). This is primarily because, as I noted earlier, linearity isn't a binary condition, and thus terms like 'linear' and 'nonlinear' can be somewhat misleading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143932/#Comment_143932" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:30:40+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 12:20PM by lachek.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, what I am <i>not</i> saying is that developers should drop what they're doing and work on true AI.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm not talking about <i>developers</i> at all.<br/><br/>The particular soapbox me and my bad French grammar is on right now pertains strictly to video game thinkers who refuse to look beyond their own immediate field.

Again, I come back to "willing suspension of disbelief," with regards to agency. If a game can make me feel, in the moment, like it would have respected any of my choices, then that is good design. It doesn't matter to me whether this is because the game cleverly distracted me from unsupported choices, or whether it actually did somehow make any choice meaningful. Moreover, the former case shows an excellent mastery of craft (at least, present craft).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>What I'm hearing in the article I quoted is a case for Turingesque game reality as an ultimate goal for all storytelling games</blockquote>\nI think "ultimate" is taking things a bit out of proportion, as I seriously doubt either of those academics believes that.

It's the willingness that is the key.  If the designer touts a game as supporting player choice and then cleverly fools the player while not really supporting choice.

If a game can make me feel, in the moment, like it would have respected any of my choices, then that is good design.</blockquote>\nCompetent design, sure. In the same sense a con man can be competent at his craft. I can admire a con man for being competent, even if I'm the target - as I can admire competent illusionism, be it performed by a street magician, a level designer or by a GM.<br/><br/>But I cannot agree that the craft itself is an admirable one, and that its perfection is a worthy goal of game design, video- or otherwise. Particularly, I cannot agree with the assumption that competent illusionism is the <i>only</i> - or even the <i>best</i> - way of telling an engaging story, in any medium.<br/><br/>It all comes down to the social contract between participants. When the street performer shoves a pack of cards in your face, you know he is going to pull a trick on you, so you instinctively suspend your disbelief in order to experience the wonder of the performance. If the agreement in your gaming group is that everyone waits for the GM to present acceptable options before acting, you can suspend your disbelief and admire the scenery as you experience the narrative delivered to you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>If the designer touts a game as supporting player choice and then cleverly fools the player while not really supporting choice, then the player wasn't willing. He/she was manipulated unwillingly.</blockquote>\nQFT. "The trick of the trade of game design is indeed to <i>make the player believe</i> she is in control".<br/><br/>This approach <i>could</i> constitute a breach of the social contract between video game developer and video game player. We don't know if it's Illusionism or Participationism, since it depends on the assumptions on the individual player. I do know there are video game players who feel cheated when discovering that exploring the range of options presented by a given game yields the exact same result. I also know there are video game players who discover this and shrug it off. I have even seen individual players react differently to different games. But to reiterate, when the illusion shatters it's never a positive experience - players just have different degrees of negative reactions.<br/><br/>The point is, a narrative can be delivered through the medium of a game without using either technique, as role-playing games as well as assorted video games (mostly simulation-types) have shown. Such narratives tend to be more subjective and intense, at the expense of the fidelity of the message and the ability to deliver it using traditional means. So yeah, maybe my gripes can be summed up by Chris':\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lemon</cite>many of the big names rode in from traditional media studies (and thus spend too much of their time trying to connect traditional narrative theories to their new subjects).</blockquote>\nYeah, good point. I guess <i>recognizing a narrative when it kicks you in the ass</i> isn't a prerequisite to commenting on narratives in video games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144035/#Comment_144035" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T14:17:13+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  2:17PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very interested at seeing what emergent qualities Spore has in this regard.  W.W. has indicated that he's specifically not interested in putting any kind of scripting or story into the game, which would be consistent with his other efforts, and so most of the story will reside in our individual imaginations.  But given that the creatures of the world will act and react based on what bits they've been built out of, and those bits (presumeably) will be tied / available / limited by what the creatures have done in prior play, it should be a great initial example of how to build some basic responsiveness to characters in a game without reliance on scripting.<br/><br/>Granted each bit is scripted...(when near X food source, grab it with claw bit; when near preditor run with feet bit; when cornered stab with tail bit)...but with a fairly broad combination of different bits it will be interesting to see how the creatures actually react.<br/><br/>Further with the ability to have your world and universe populated with creatures played in other people's games you can have a much greater variety of "playtested" combinations.<br/><br/>I suspect given the tremendous delays that the game won't wind up being nearly as ambitious as first imagined...and indeed I believe they've already nixxed some of the "evolution" aspects of creature development in favor of an easier (but less impressive) "unlock and build" model...but it should still be a great starting point for future generations of design.<br/><br/>One can easily imagine "wierd space creatures" being replaced with "NPCs" and "claw bits, foot bits, and tail bits" being replaced with "personality, friend, and loyalty bits" a generation or two from now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144039/#Comment_144039" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T14:40:58+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  2:40PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 2:43PM by lachek.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>(don't quote Turing at me - there <i>is</i> a difference).</blockquote>\nThere is?

The original Ghost Recon (2000) was very heavily dependent on artificial intelligence and changing game states. This results in a user-driven experience; three players can play through the same mission and have radically different experiences (mythocentric narrative).<br/><br/>The latest, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 (2007), is more linear and far more scripted. This results in a more developer-driven experience; three players can play through the same mission and have near-identical experiences (logocentric narrative).<br/><br/>I didn't work on either game, but I worked on several games in between (including Ghost Recon 2, Ghost Recon 2: Summit Strike, and Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter). Observing the transition from mythocentric design to logocentric design was very educational.<br/><br/>Resident Evil (1996) took place in a labyrinthine mansion. Though you had to find keys and items in order to progress, the sheer size of the area and the number of doors made it possible for players to have radically different user experiences while playing. Resident Evil 4 (2005) was far more linear, presenting the player with a number of stages that had to be navigated from one end to the other, like a standard FPS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144047/#Comment_144047" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T14:59:28+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  2:59PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite><br/>It's not like someone hands a game designer thirty million dollars and says, hey, got any ideas for a cool game?

Often, parameters are established by management long before anyone is attached to the project. It's decided in advance that this will be a sequel, or a movie tie-in, and that it will include features X and Y. Then, a development team is attached to the project and work begins on the concept. Even then, there can be substantial input from the management team (including both the developer and the publisher) and the marketing team.<br/><br/>The exact process varies wildly from studio to studio, of course.

Even if the game doesn't charge for server connections (like WoW), solid multiplayer will increase box sales significantly, and extend the life of the product, making expansions more profitable. And Spore is quite famous for being "massively single player," in that a massive variety of entities get created by players and absorbed automatically onto central servers where they are then automatically shared out to other players algorithmically determined to be of similar taste.<br/><br/>The Sims fan community lacks Spore's automation, but actually functions much the same way through a very active network of fansites.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that the solutions any of these games can be universally applied, though.

I'm of a very strong opinion that the vast majority of MMOs do <i>not</i> use players in place of AI, but rather use the "massive" aspect as an excuse to charge a monthly fee for what amounts to a dressed up Diablo-style single- or small-group-multiplayer dungeon crawl game.<br/><br/>And in such games, yeah, hell is other people.<br/><br/>But a few developers actually gets that if they're producing a "massive" title, it's better to play to that medium's strength than try to compensate for the problems it causes. Look at games like Eve Online and A Tale In The Desert for prime examples. No shards, no instancing, no periodic world resets, no crazy nerfbat-swinging, no constant demand for more and more and more content via patches and expansions. Play consist largely of the manipulation of emergent patterns themselves produced by the players.<br/><br/>Yeah, they're quite unique games, and obviously not as financially successful as WoW, EQ2, that lot. But it's design which takes its medium into consideration, which I think serve as a better measure of objective quality than quarterly profits do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144096/#Comment_144096" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T21:23:33+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  9:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>It's a technological limitation.

I don't think Matheas or Klastrup are saying anything earth shattering by pointing this out. Keep in mind that when they were writing those words, "sandbox games" were still new enough that people (including yours truly) felt clever when we pointed out that "you can't really do <em>anything</em>." We also still thought digital watches were a really neat idea once. It's quite understandable for an academic to then try to resolve the player sensation of "I can do anything in this game" that you often saw reported in gamer forums and reviews, with the obvious mathematical reality that with limited development time and space on the disc, no you really can't.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>This fits well with the notion that the eight-figure budgets is what's holding innovation back in the first place.</blockquote>\nWell, it's probably not literally the money. It's the additional voices that typically come with that kind of cash. Design by committee has always had this sort of problem. An independently wealthy person making their own games alone probably has about as much of a chance of innovating as anybody else. Plus in the specific example of Bioware/Atari, working for a publicly traded company can end up creating the type of deadlines that result in the cutting of corners and the minimization of risk. There's not a professional developer out there who doesn't have a story about a brilliant idea that got cut for time reasons.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't think of any other ways to restate my opinions on the topic of this thread, so I'm gonna go ship <a href="http://www.deadspacegame.com" rel="nofollow">my game</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144107/#Comment_144107" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T01:03:08+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:03AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 1:18AM by Rafael.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Rafael: Not sure what you mean?

I believe that they're a reflection of thought in someone else's line of work -- that line of work being the study of games (not the development of games).<br/><br/>As a game designer, I <b><i>don't</i></b> feel that avenues of thought are cut off by creativity. They're cut off by practical considerations -- such as money, time, and orders from above. You make the game that you're hired to make. And I'm not complaining about it, either. It's like working in the movie business. I may have a terrific idea for a horror movie, but if I'm hired to do the special effects for the latest version of Hostel, then I'll do the best job that I can within the project's parameters.<br/><br/>My ideas are just that -- ideas. Until I've got a few million to burn, I can't very well expect the industry to stop everything and make the kind of game that I dream about.<br/><br/>As for game studies, that's an entirely different field, and it is my observation that very few game designers are involved in the academic study of games. During my eight years in the industry, I've only read a handful of articles on the subject of game studies. Instead, I usually read books and articles about the process of game development, written by other game designers (or producers, or creative directors, or what-have-you). I read about other developers' experiences, good and bad, and I learn from their work in the field.<br/><br/>You've probably heard this one before, but -- the difference between theory and practice is that in theory, they're the same, but in practice, they're different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144108/#Comment_144108" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T01:03:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:03AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>Anyway, I can't think of any other ways to restate my opinions on the topic of this thread, so I'm gonna go ship<a href="http://www.deadspacegame.com" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">my game</a>.</blockquote>\nOh, damn, you're working on that?

What they say is, "Given that we can't at the moment do better, the best we can do is illusionism." I read a paper only last week that said precisely this (and I'm now not able to remember where the hell I read it). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if nobody else is saying this, Greg Costickyan is saying it. And he's speaking directly to not only the game designers, but to the ludologists themselves, as he is perhaps the original ludologist. I have no idea how powerful his voice is in ludology or computer design, but it's been clamoring for the new technology for a long time, claiming that games like My Life With Master can show us the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I mean really, if you said to a ludologist, "It would be better if player agency caused real changes in play, and we'd still get a good story" you think that the ludologist would disagree? Really? No, at worst you'd get a patronizing, "That's impossible, so we do the next best thing." But I think most would say, "We're looking forward to that day as well." <br/>\n<br/>\nAre we getting to the point where we're both going to have to go reading and cite papers? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike

I've played Morrowind several times, with several different characters, and in each case, the narrative has been completely different -- different characters, different outcomes. For example, joining one of the three faction houses in Morrowind automatically means that the other two become your enemy, and you can't join them. Each has its own story, complete with characters, goals, missions, and ultimately ascension to power. This story affects the other quests, should you choose to pursue those, as one of the houses is at war with one of the guilds, and another house is allied with one of the guilds, and so on.<br/><br/>What this means is that Morrowind and Oblivion are embedded with hundreds of hours of <i>meaningful</i> play experiences, because there are multiple stories included with each game. I've played Morrowind for over 400 hours, and I've never beaten the game's main quest (nor do I plan to anytime soon). Oblivion is a smaller game, both in terms of real estate and features, because of the demands of next-gen development (presumably), but it still features more meaningful narrative freedom than anything else out there. I stress the word meaningful, because it's not a mere change in game state -- there's actual narrative built into the game in terms of voice acting, text-on-screen, journal entries, clues, icons on your map, and so on. The developers have also loaded both games with dozens of mini-stories that aren't based on affiliations with factions -- in Morrowind, you may become an abolitionist who frees slaves from captivity, earning the hatred of slavers while becoming the champion of a secret organization resembling the Underground Railroad.<br/><br/>The thing to keep in mind about open-ended games is that some, like the GTA series, feature <i>one</i> storyline, which must be completed in order to "conclude" the game. Though there are numerous side-missions and pursuits, there are no narrative alternatives. If you're playing the primary storyline, and you can't beat a particular mission, you can't go join another criminal organization and be a part of their team instead -- you're stuck with one storyline and one group of characters, so the fun things that you do aren't meaningful play, in terms of advancing an actual in-game narrative. If you decide to steal a cab and make a living driving people around the city in your cab, no one will ever talk to you about driving cabs as you're walking around the city. You'll never get a message telling you that the head of the cab company wants to promote you. In short, there's no meaningful response to the interaction.<br/><br/>Therefore, Morrowind and Oblivion occupy a very specific niche.<br/><br/>Whoooooo!

I couldn't agree more. <br/><br/>That's one of the reasons I'm still playing Morrowind. It's exceedingly strange -- floating citadels, bizarre architecture, weird monsters (Kagouti? Guar? Netch?). I love it dearly for those reasons. Also, you can fly (well, levitate) and create bizarre enchanted items (without all the restrictions imposed by Oblivion's item-creation system) and -- this is the real kicker -- there's no real adjustment made for your level. <br/><br/>In Morrowind, if you're low-level, and you enter a Daedric temple, you are smoked in seconds. Some demon runs up and crushes you flatter than a week-old beer, so go ahead and reload from your last save. Then, you come back after you've gone up a few levels, and it's suddenly a fair fight. The exhilaration! The pride you take in vanquishing this once-unbeatable foe! But in Oblivion, everything scales to your level, so the challenge remains static throughout the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144224/#Comment_144224" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T13:00:58+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 1:01PM by fnord3125.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>This fits well with the notion that the eight-figure budgets is what's holding innovation back in the first place.</blockquote>\nWell yeah, didn't someone mention that as costs increase the willingness to take risks goes down?<br/>A perfect real world example is the contemporary interactive fiction community.  No one is trying to sell those games anymore.  There are no more commercial companies producing text adventures.  But the people making them for free are doign some really interesting, cool stuff with the medium.  And frequently it's stuff they are willing to try precisely because it isn't a commercial venture.  When you're spending a lot of time worrying about whether or not the game is going to bring in lots of paying customers you're going to tend to be conservative.<br/><br/>Not needing to worry about customers because <b>no one will ever buy your game</b> has got to be extremely liberating from a creative standpoint.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144226/#Comment_144226" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T13:04:50+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:04PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh and as an addendum, i'm guessing it also helps a lot when you don't need customers because you can produce your game fairly easily for free.  but, ya know... whatever.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144232/#Comment_144232" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T13:27:13+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 1:48PM by lachek.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>No, I mean really, if you said to a ludologist, "It would be better if player agency caused real changes in play, and we'd still get a good story" you think that the ludologist would disagree?

But I think most would say, "We're looking forward to that day as well."</blockquote>\nMike, I'm not making points on technology. I'm making points on the social contract between developer and player, of broadening the definition of "narrative" outside of "linear pre-written plotline", and recognizing that narrative can exist and be enjoyed without immersion. These are all lessons we have learned from reading, playing and talking about independently produced RPGs over the last 5-10 years. In fact, one of the milestones which addressed all of these was <i>your own game</i>.<br/><br/>There is a social contract between the developer and the player. It is not the same social contract for every game and every player, so it is impossible to define the boundaries of the individual social contracts. It is, however, possible to consider the range of those social contracts, and what breaching them might do to the relationship between the player and the game, and the player and the developer. My point here is that "mak[ing] the player believe she is in control" when she is not <i>can</i> constitute a major violation of many of those social contracts, at the point of reveal (which, as stated, usually occurs during a replay or with players who engage in game state exploration). Further, the reveal is <i>never</i> a positive one, in my experience - the best you can get is a shrug. In my opinion, this warrants rethinking the idea that mastery of illusionism is a goal in (pragmatic) game design.<br/><br/>What other techniques can you use, with today's technology? To restate what I mentioned above, what is wrong with just making the social contract explicit - <i>tell me</i> when I need to get back on track. Arcade style racing games will flash big red letters saying WRONG WAY when you're off course. It doesn't shatter my enjoyment of the game for it to remind me that, no, it's not an audience-murdering simulator, it's a racer. Similarly, FFCC has an elaborate story, and it doesn't allow me to try to make my own - it's like, "hey, kill those monsters so we can get on with the story, okay?".<br/><br/>Narratives do not all consist of linear plotlines and they do not need to be enjoyed objectively to be valid. The Sims makes stories in a perfectly non-linear way with plenty of meaningful choices made by the player. The Sims doesn't deliver those narratives in a consistent, reproducible, or even objective way, of course. What role-playing games have taught me is that not only are those things not all that important for the enjoyment of a narrative, but as a designer it's possible to tweak the game system in such a way as to make certain thematic points come up more frequently than others. For example, The Sims is more likely to produce stories about suburban white America and its challenges - falling in love, getting a good job, paying bills, juggling kids, achieving your life's aspirations (in Sims 2) - than stories about urban black America and its challenges.<br/><br/>With some careful thought, using current technology, there is no reason one could not create a video game which delivers a powerful thematic narrative with reasonable reliability, just by manipulating the system. It just wouldn't follow the movie making or novel writing paradigm in terms of what went into the design of its story and "mechanics". Perhaps it would share similarities with LARP design. Storytron seems to be aiming for something like that - introduce a bunch of Actors, give them carefully constructed motivations and occasional trigger points, then let the player loose to explore, push and prod the structure.<br/><br/>Finally, you and I both know it's possible to enjoy a narrative without being immersed in it. Are you immersed in the role of mayor when you play Sim City? No? Can you still enjoy the story of your city and make interesting choices? Sure!<br/><br/>So why do we have to "trick" players into losing themselves in the perceived reality of the game? Is it really worth threatening the social contract you have with the player for that tiny speck of suspension of disbelief a fake door in HL2 can provide? Yes, in role-playing games we frequently describe elements which exist only for colour too, and it can make the game more engaging. But to make the claim that developers ought to aspire to trick players into believing manipulating those colour elements amount to advancing the story by utilizing illusionist techniques, and that this represents <i>the only functional way of conveying a narrative in a video game</i> using today's technology... well, that's what caused me to write this post to begin with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144237/#Comment_144237" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T13:35:00+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:35PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another point of view to consider (since I haven't muddied the waters enough already): big-budget developers can also push the envelope because they know they've got a sure thing. <br/><br/>If you're working on a triple-A game with a huge fan base, and you can pretty much count on turning a significant profit, you can afford to take some risks that a middle-of-the-road developer would probably avoid.

Indeed, once you complete the game, it begins to feel VERY empty. Once you've finished all the guild quests, there's maybe a handful of side quests you can complete but nothing truly interactive.<br/><br/>My favorite moments in Oblivion have been in the sense of treating it like an anthill, not the mediocre dungeon crawling or the admittedly bad fantasy writing. Glitching to the top of Silgrad Tower and seeing the entire world before me was probably my second favorite moment. My second favorite moment was manipulating the simplistic "AI" into an anarchist rebellion by getting max disposition with everyone and attacking a guard. Both of these were in the post-questing game, where I had run out of anything distracting to do.<br/><br/>While in Morrowind, you are afforded more freedom to choose your path by limiting your freedom to choose EVERY path at the same time, it still doesn't approach what I felt was the excellent execution of games like Fallout 1/2 and surprisingly, Arcanum.<br/><br/>While the number of quests wasn't quite as limitless in either instance, I felt the quality of them, and the freedom to choose a path without the option to take every path was much better executed.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, this is getting into a diatribe that basically amounts to: my tastes are different than yours. Also, they're apparently out of touch with popular gamers, as Oblivion was financially successful while Arcanum was a total failure.<br/><br/>In response to discussion of Dwarf Fortress:<br/>I haven't ever been able to play for more than 5 minutes, because I can't understand what passes for an interface.

It's like trying to understand an obscure fantasy heartbreaker that decided to go the route of being far too complex for mortals, which is all the more heartbreaking because the core of it looks brilliant, from what I've heard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144457/#Comment_144457" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T11:10:38+00:00" title="May 16, 2008 11:10AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Besides...

Britney Spears sells millions of CDs, while musicians of integrity (such as Behemoth) get by with a few thousand sales per release. It's the world we live in.<br/><br/>Just to restate my earlier point: I prefer Morrowind to Oblivion. In short, Oblivion was just like Morrowind, only with better graphics and half the features.<br/><br/>As for Arcanum and Fallout, I've heard of them, but I never got into PC games.

And so pretty much there's a mysterious portal, yawn, and you go through it, mega-yawn, and...you're in a room with a dude who informs you that you're entering the realms of Sheogorath the Mad. And then the opposite wall TURNS INTO A GIANT CLOUD OF PURPLE BUTTERFLIES and you're set upon with a skyline and plantlife and world that basically is what I imagine Oblivion would be if a Lovecraftian bad guy won.  It's frickin' amazing. And everyone who lives there is completely barking mad.

I still play IF's now and then and I do find I am still (sometimes) able to invest and feel like my choices are meaningful, even though I know for a fact every choice I can make is mapped out. So I wonder if I am just good at deluding myself or if <i>meaningful choice is measured by something other/more than affecting outcome</i>. <br/><br/>Someone above said that videogames are linear. I'm not sure if I'm reading the statement correctly, but I think I disagree. I would point out that games can have multiple endings programmed in. They don't have to be linear in the sense that all roads lead to point Z. A game can be programmed so as to end at either X, Y, or Z, all of which might be radically different, and player choice affects which path the game takes. Though I will admit that all this is still linear, just in a more complex way than I took the original statement mean.<br/><br/>Sometimes we make choices in our real lives that are HIGHLY meaningful and yet we know the exact outcome is preprogrammed. My boss might present me with an unsavory ultimatum and I might "take a stand" knowing I will be fired. In other words, I am faced with a fork in the road and I know what the result will be on either side. I choose how I want to "win" that game by deciding if winning means keeping my job or winning means maintaining my ethics. That is an interesting choice and, once I make it, a meaningful one. It doesn't matter that all possibilities are programmed. <br/><br/>[For some reason the quote from Tale of Two Cities is running in my head in which the gentleman facing the guillotine says, "It is a far, far better thing I do ..."]<br/><br/>Also, sometimes the plot of the game just doesn't matter. It's the journey that counts. My kids play Pokemon on their Nintendo DS's and I have played enough to understand what I like and dislike about the game. It's amazing how much of their emotional investment in the game is driven by things like which Pokemon they have in their "party" (the six they carry around with them all the time). Beating Team Galactic or whatever, is secondary to other pursuits in the game. Exploring, collecting, pimping out Pokeballs, building a home fort below ground and putting cool furniture in it, etc. There's a lot of choosing going on there and if it weren't meaningful they would have quit playing the game long ago. It's meaningful to them. <br/><br/>So. I guess I'm saying that programmed choices and linear plots don't completely eradicate the possibility for meaningful or interesting choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268693/#Comment_268693" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T14:06:09+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  2:06PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much of this thread is worth rereading in light of this <a href="http://dieubussy.blogspot.com/2009/07/into-night-with-jason-rohrer-and-chris.html" rel="nofollow">talk between Chris Crawford and Jason Rohrer</a>.
