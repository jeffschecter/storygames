The Stair is notorious for danger, especially when you've failed... And I want to use/enjoy the Fiasco rules for both the open style of scene creation  and  the inherent  "melodrama"  it suggests,  that is perfect for teenage angsty adventure.<br/>As for campaign inspirations to consider (with Fiasco alterations):   <br/>Hogwarts, NewMutants/X-menAcademy,  Buffy's HS years,  Smallville HS years.  <br/>And even movies like TAPS  or  Full Metal Jacket!!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Any suggestions??<br/>Thanks!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391216/#Comment_391216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T11:27:14+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 11:27AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The worst games of Fiasco I've had have been because people lose sight of "the plan" or don't pay any attention to making "a plan."<br/>You have a distinct advantage, in that you can set what "the plan" should be before you even start playing.<br/><br/>So pick a thing that happened Freshman Year, something big and important that each character has an agenda for.  Make sure everyone sets their first two scenes before that thing, roll the Tilt, and have the last two scenes be "trying to cover up the mess that was" the thing.<br/><br/>It should keep focus, keep the gonzo down, and really smooth the character creation process out.<br/><br/>Sounds like a fun project!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391220/#Comment_391220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T11:58:12+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 11:58AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Changes needed, off the top of my head:<br/>* Not random setup--no way to "make My Guy" with a random setup. Can "make Some Guy" though, if that's what y'all are into (i.e., highly constrained creativity).<br/>* Tilt and Aftermath makes no sense in "character generation" (unless you want every character to have some kind of borked up history.. and the old Traveler character generation outcome of a dead PC before playing it!).<br/>* Elements--OK, maybe Location; maybe Object (especially for "Gear Guy"). But Need? MAYBE could NOT resolve the Need, to make something like a BW Belief. But without the mechanical support to "ping" the Need in the game you eventually play... it's just backstory. Also, do you want Needs bound to couples (i.e., each is tied to a specific Relationship, as they are by default in Fiasco)?<br/><br/>Honestly... I love Fiasco. For what it DOES: complete story arcs with typically debilitating (or outright lethal) outcomes for most participants. If I wanted to "bolt on" some of its qualities to character generation for another game, I'd just look at Relationship mapping and, perhaps, a DitV-like Initiation scene and/or Microscope-like background creation. Save Fiasco for "lonely fun" of storyboarding fiction (as many folks seem to be doing with it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391228/#Comment_391228" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T12:50:17+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 12:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See also page 46 of the <i>Fiasco Companion</i> for advice on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
