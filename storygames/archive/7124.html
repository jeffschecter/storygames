So, here it is:<br/><br/>First, you need an fitting setting to do this. Good features are: <br/> - there are some overall ethics / rule system which the PCs know (more or less). <br/>     e.g.: chivalry, law and order, the Mafia code<br/> - there are some enclosed places / communities / locations where NPCs live in social relationships<br/>     e.g.: a space station, a monastary, China town<br/> - the PCs are in a position where they have to care about the well-being of these places / people, <br/>   and they have options to decide stuff<br/>     e.g.: Knights of the King, agents of the inquisition, some Jedis in the Old Republic<br/> - quite handy, but optional: some hidden power that either profits of breaking the law, or punishes it<br/>     e.g.: the Force (never underestimate the power of the dark side!), the police (if the law is the Mafia code),<br/>     or Murphy's Law.<br/><br/>Secondly, define the steps of sin progression so they fit for your setting.<br/>e.g. for Star Wars: "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering." (Yoda)<br/>There is a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17107.0" rel="nofollow">comprehensive list</a> of Dogs in other settings at the Forge forum.<br/><br/>And finally, proceed like in the town creation process.<br/><br/>I ran several workshops on conventions called: 'What we can learn from Dogs in the Vineyard" (for playing other games). We discussed the GM hints and the town creation process, and created a story sketch in a setting chosen by the participants. Once it was a medieval fantasy setting, once a Star Wars, and once we discussed the PCs begin Mafia members who should try to get a quarter of their city back on track.<br/><br/>And I use the town creation process for myself, when I have less than 30 minutes to prepare for masterin.<br/>It worked perfectly on Engel, Mage, and Star Trek (LARP). Next time I'll use it with Pendragon (Arthurian stories).<br/><br/>I ran one those setting four times, with different players (in Engel). The most amazing thing for me is that the players always surprise me as a GM on how they interpret the situation. And by the "follow the players lead to what's important"-hint, this always leads to a significantly different story.<br/>This is why I like it so much.<br/><br/>Daniela                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158445/#Comment_158445" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T17:25:25+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  5:25PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniela</cite>Secondly, define the steps of sin progression so they fit for your setting.</blockquote>\nThis one is the huge leap for me. The Star Wars example is a good one, but how many other source materials have a clear sin progression? Usually it is more a web of nastiness.<br/><br/>And I agree this must be done, this is the plot part of the situation generator...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniela" title="Daniela"><img alt="Daniela" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniela">Daniela</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158499/#Comment_158499" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T02:04:30+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  2:04AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley, even if the source material has a web of nastiness instead of a clear progression, the only thing you need to apply the town creation process is one ordered path through the web where things get worse. This path does not have to be the only one, nor globally exist in your setting.<br/><br/>So, if you're playing Mage, the Tradition PCs can find this one chantry where things slowly degenerated from a lively Tradition oriented society to be Nephandus (based on a sin progression pretty similar to Dogs, including Demons). And later in the campaign, the PCs find a Technocratic construct that got quite liberal in the last years (based on a sin progression within the Technocratic ethics, something like Own Ideas lead to Free Thinking lead to Free Interpretation of Orders lead to Subversion lead to Rebellion). And with the right influence, the PCs might get this construct on their side.<br/><br/>I think, the core factor of sin progression and the plots created by the process is "Things get worse if you do not act". <br/>Typically, its the NPCs who did not act - or even didn't realize the problem yet, and its the PCs who find out about the situation, are responsible and have the position to act.<br/><br/>Is there a specific setting you are interested in where we could try to find an equivalent to sin progression?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/warren" title="warren"><img alt="warren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/GoPlayMario.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/warren">warren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158504/#Comment_158504" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T02:51:15+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  2:51AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would also recommend <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16326.0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> on the Forge about adapting Dogs to other settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158506/#Comment_158506" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T03:38:55+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  3:38AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u201eSin Progression\u201c is just a short hand for \u201eWhat could possibly go wrong now to make things worse?\u201c \u2013 as Daniela pointed out, it doesn't need to be as static as in dogs; it just needs to be clear regarding the subject society.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158693/#Comment_158693" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T17:32:47+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  5:32PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2008 5:33PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.amagi-games.com/2008/06/broken-places.html" rel="nofollow">Broken Places</a> is a situation-builder (with fillable PDF) I wrote that was <i>totally</i> inspired by Dogs.
