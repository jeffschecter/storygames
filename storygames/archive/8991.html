In other words, you don't have to set it up so that Key can fire. Let them Fire it and see how they want that Key to affect their life. I mean, one use of Key of Masochist is to combine it with Key of Bloodlust to essentially double your XPs for getting into a fight. another use might be to play a Passive-Aggessive character who gets in arguments for Harm just to prove a point. These are very different Character concepts that use the same Key.<br/>\n2) If you are inspired by the Key, throw it out there. Just don't expect the player to bite. And watch their reaction closely. Are they biting because they think they have to because the SG put it out there or because it's XPs or because its what their character would do or?<br/>\n<br/>\n  As an example, I had a player who made an Elf. I threw a well-thought-out love interest at her and she didn't even vaguely react and when I tried to put a little more emphasis on it, she made sure that her character stayed out of those scenes. So, I dropped it. Ironically, other players kept asking about that character, but I just said she was somewhere else, lol.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198700/#Comment_198700" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T08:38:07+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  8:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This Key is my secret sin. Whenever a player takes it, I ignore it completely. As far as I see that Key has nothing to say about life, society or sexual perversions, so it's sort of empty of meaning. I guess it's sort of a good generic Key that allows a player to be proactive and get his xp himself, but as the Story Guide I don't have anything to do with it. Similar to the Key of Bloodlust in many ways, although the latter at least involves some concrete in-game action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198701/#Comment_198701" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T08:42:21+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  8:42AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd try hard to put the character in situations where getting hurt is a very poor choice.  From a player's perspective this is similar to Key of Doom, where you're going to be throwing yourself into conflicts with abandon, because what the hell?  <br/><br/>Getting hurt is bad when it happens in front of people you care about, are protecting from harm, want to impress with your badassery, or will themselves be harmed by seeing you mauled.  It's bad when the injury will prevent some other activity that is important to you, like swimming for your life.  So engineering situations where the player can make the choice about activating the Key or not is where the fun is, I guess.  It isn't my favorite Key.  It feels very self-indulgent and inwardly-focused.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198708/#Comment_198708" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T09:29:31+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  9:29AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2009 9:31AM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inwardly focused? Its a key about getting beaten bloody, not about your secret pain! Bah upon thee Morningstar! <br/><br/>That said, the rest of what Jason said is pretty good. Taking damage is a dangerous thing, doing it for fun is a thing that's likely to get you mangled. <br/><br/>I've seen this key used in game twice -- once in each of the classic ways that Dave points out. One was a guy that was totally Wolverine like, an atavistic character who the player loved to have those kind of bloody, drawn out fights with where blood and guts are everywhere and at the end the character wins, standing over the brutalized body of the foe, but dripping gore himself. The other was a Zaru slave girl who'd sold herself into bondage in order to get closer to the Ammenite prince that she was "in love" with. (Notably the character didn't have the Key of Love or any such -- she had like the Key of Masochism, the Key of The Outcast and the Key of the Mission: To Make the Prince Mine. She was, obviously, an exploration of dysfunctional and abusive relationships.) <br/><br/>In both cases the most common thing to do for me to ping their key was to have a situation in which they knew something important and/or bad was coming up soon and that going into it bleeding might cost them something they valued. The second most common thing was to play status games around it. <br/><br/>Examples that I dimly remember include the Zaru girl getting into a snit-fight with the Prince while she knew that her arch-nemesis was waiting  outside to come comfort the prince if she didn't get him to forgive her. So she's in a situation where she can try to win the conflict, try to get injured and get XP, but in which doing both is going to be very, very difficult. (As it was she ended up crushed and sent away, took the 5 xp and hired another PC to kill the rival.) <br/><br/>The other one was with the Wolverine dude (I cannot remember his name to save my life...), who had an ally character with whom he had a rivalry. They never took a Key about it, that I remember, but they were always one upping each other. And every time they'd get in a fight and boyo started hitting his KoM, I'd do my very best to make the other guy hit hard in the fight but not get visibly damaged. Then at the end of the fight, he'd be there pristine and unruffled to mock the bleeding, gouged PC mercilessly. "Certainly, sir-ah, we both defeated four of the cads... but only one of us shall be making dinner with the mademoiselle tonight." That kind of shit.<br/><br/>Edit: I just remembered another thing -- I don't think we actually did it, but we once thought about renaming the key "Key of the Impulsive Hero" or something like that for a character of a player who traditionally played cautiously and wanted to kick himself in the pants to do things that might get his character hurt. He hoped that by having a reward for something that he had a really hard time with happening, he'd let it happen more often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198724/#Comment_198724" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T10:23:28+00:00" title="March 25, 2009 10:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br/><br/>The final comment from Brand is what I think this players is going for--his character is kind of a daredevil, unafraid to take a beating, and the player sees him as often getting into trouble and coming out defeated or bloody.<br/><br/>I'm wondering particularly whether I should adjust the way I set stakes as a Story Guide--I suppose that setting Harm levels at 4, 5, or 6 makes it more tempting for the player to a) engage in those conflicts or checks, and b) less interested in buying bonus dice.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure exactly to what level to do this...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198725/#Comment_198725" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T10:23:30+00:00" title="March 25, 2009 10:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2009 6:44AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I AM OFFENDED BRAND<br/><br/>I guess I meant that it is a lazy "do something for me" Key that is purely reactive.
