Why is that? The effect of this is that it makes it just *slightly* more likely during Crime Resolution that it turns out that the Victim faked the crime (or committed suicide, etc.). If the Crime Grid was seeded with the Suspect's name, it would make it just *slightly* more likely during Crime Resolution that the initial hypothesis turns out to have been true all along. <br/><br/>That being the case, it seems that designating one of the starting characters as the Suspect has no mechanical effect on the game. It only serves to draw the Investigator's attention to that character at the start of play. You could, it seems to me, go through the whole game without it ever being mechanically possible that the Suspect committed the Crime! <br/><br/>Anyone have any idea why this is? Seth, do you read this board? <br/><br/>- N                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464057/#Comment_464057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T01:31:44+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  1:31AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That seems like it makes sense.

There's only one thing that we know: the person *coming to the investigator* is involved. The Suspect isn't even necessarily involved. He could just be a patsy that the Victim/"victim" is using to take the blame. Or, you know, not.<br/><br/>So, you're actually correct that the only purpose of the Suspect is to draw the investigator's attention at the beginning of play. That entire rules subset exists simply to get things moving."<br/><br/>Cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464247/#Comment_464247" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-23T01:22:57+00:00" title="June 23, 2017  1:22AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
