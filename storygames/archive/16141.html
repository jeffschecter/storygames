I also don't think I'd split up the goals, beliefs, and instincts, and I probably wouldn't put them in as principles (i.e. things that guide moment-to-moment play) since I only really worry about that stuff during mission creation. For me, MG is about creating a mission that will be interesting and will be a challenge, and then being a fan of the players if and when they overcome it. My take on the player's turn is that I'm almost completely hands-off as a GM, I just call for rolls when the fiction demands it, setting the Obs that the rules demand, and playing the NPCs as "realistically" as possible given what I know about their personalities, etc. I don't intentionally inject new fiction during the player's turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368112/#Comment_368112" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T09:52:23+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  9:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 9:53AM by Teataine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not exactly principles, but...<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/>*Give the patrol a dangerous, urgent or serious mission or an innocent one that turns out to be one of the above.<br/>*Present obstacles, offer solutions.<br/>*Play nature, animals, weasels and other mice passionately.<br/>*Make the players' characters heroes by giving them chances to fight for what they believe.<br/>*Challenge their Beliefs, and give them opportunities to bring their Instincts and Traits into play.<br/>*Drive play towards a safe spot or conclusion of the mission.<br/><br/>On their turn:<br/>*Sit back, let them do what they want.<br/>*Portray the NPCs with gusto.<br/>*Manage rolls where needed.<br/>*Wrap up when they're done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368124/#Comment_368124" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T11:21:58+00:00" title="March 16, 2012 11:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Gregor -- I like "Challenge their beliefs" rather than "Thwart their beliefs."<br/><br/>I'd also add these to the GM turn:<ul>\n<li>Be the gatekeeper to the fiction, ensure that all tests are adequately fictionalized.

Completely agreed on the importance of writing a good mission ahead of time that challenges beliefs and instincts.<br/><br/>I would just add that along with being gatekeeper to the fiction, you are also gate keeper to the mechanics. It's important to remind players of how to gain checks, how to properly spend persona, tax their nature and so forth.<br/><br/>Along those lines, during the GM turn, enforce the rule (through the fiction) for spending checks on player turn actions.

(p. 46, 55)<br/>  Transform the players' guardmice characters into heroes, by challenging the players with obstacles set in their path (p. 8)<br/>* Keep with the mood of Mouse Guard as a whole (p. 14)<br/>* Create missions that develop organically from the situation of the patrol (p. 57) [The ** ones below are mission creation guidelines]<br/>** Challenge the patrol with weather, wilderness, animals, and mice (p. 61, 64)<br/>** Pick two hazards as known problems and keep the other two hazards in reserve (p. 61)<br/>** Challenge beliefs (p. 44, 55, 62)<br/>** Put the player in situations that trigger his instinct (p. 48, 55, 63)<br/>** Play goals against beliefs (p. 63)<br/>** Threaten relationships (p. 63)<br/>* If you're playing a session that will represent a whole season, use your twists to create long term problems (especially in players' turn) (p. 72, 75)<br/>* Put the character in situations where the reputation of the Guard is at stake (p. 44)<br/>* Don't repeat the same situation twice. (p. 91)<br/>* If you're feeling generous, give the player what he was after but give him a condition (p. 92 ) [I read that as: a twist should be your default and the condition a fallback. Agree?]<br/>* Arbitrate the use of wises (p. 92)<br/>* As the action in the game builds to a head, call for a conflict (p. 96)<br/>* When everyone is excited and shouting, stop the action and ask everyone to be quiet. Then go around the table asking each player what they are doing and why (p. 132)<br/>* Present a rich, colorful, and consistent world to the players through vivid descriptions and by bringing to life engaging characters, by imagining their belief, goal and instinct and keeping that in mind as you play them. (p. 133)<br/><br/>On the players turn:<br/><br/>* If you're playing a session that will represent a whole season, use your twists to create long term problems (especially in players' turn) (p. 72, 75)<br/>* Prompt the players with the rules (p. 76)<br/>* Play the Relationships and Characters (p.76)<br/>* If the players engage each other, use a character to play into the situation. (p. 76)<br/>* Offer advice on the rules (p. 77)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368263/#Comment_368263" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T13:35:27+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  1:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, circle icons!<br/><br/>It's cool to see them all listed out like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368438/#Comment_368438" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T07:23:41+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  7:23AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is an excellent list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
