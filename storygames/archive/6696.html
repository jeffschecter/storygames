I don't think this is a straw man. I've never had a problem with the idea of lonely fun. In fact, I want to design some games that support it. <br/><br/>As I posted elsewhere, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6662" rel="nofollow">I'm starting a D&amp;D 4E campaign soon</a>. Like, our first game is a week from now. And I'm trying hard to wait for player input before designing a setting. I want the setting to be a collaborative product of all the players.<br/><br/>I am chomping at the fucking bit. I literally cannot wait for next Saturday. I am excited about this game. I find myself re-reading the rules, making characters I will never play, thinking about setting stuff but not writing it down, buying supplies to make cool 1" miniature tokens, and everything but playing and designing the setting.<br/><br/>If I could play now, I'd be fine. But I can play only once a month with these guys. <br/><br/>If I could work on the setting or the next encounter or something, I'd be fine. But I am making myself wait for the input of my friends before going down that path, so I have like nothing to do. It's maddening. Once we start, I'll have prep work but 4e seems to reduce that to a couple hours. I'll fill the additional hours between games stealing cool art off the web and making more mini tokens. <br/><br/>I understand why GMs spend hours and hours fleshing out the moon systems of their settings and detailing the 19 generations of royalty who came before in the Kingdom of Prilosec. Because they're <i>going crazy waiting to play again</i>. Because the game is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fun</span> and they want the experience to continue.<br/><br/>Of course, if playing the game is vastly less fun than prepping for it, you could argue that there's a problem, and I wouldn't disagree if the players don't enjoy the playing. If everyone is having fun playing, and prep is even more fun, that sounds like a good game to me.<br/><br/>And in D&amp;D, player prep can be loads of fun, too. Memorizing monsters and spells makes you better at the game, and makes your character more effective, and therefore when you Step On Up, you can do it really well, and that's awesome, so that kind of lonely fun for players is cool, too.<br/><br/>By the way, making up my human cleric of Avandra at 1st level took me 30 minutes, minus equipment. About 15 minutes of that was me trying to find the rule that told me how many powers I got. Now that I know that the "leveling up" section applies to 1st level, too, I won't skim it. A skilled player should be able to put together a full character in 15-30 minutes, including gear.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148434/#Comment_148434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T13:46:20+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  1:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, word.

At least, that's what I thought it meant. Or some variation.<br/><br/>IOW, I don't see lonely fun as prepping for a real game. Lonely fun is what is done when real gaming isn't happening, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: I'm currently, in breaks between marathon Tenra Bansho translation and editing binges, designing new PC races for an upcoming 4e game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148442/#Comment_148442" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T14:14:33+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  2:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figure, a designer who wants to engage players all the time should consider ways to engage them between game sessions.

That's the "lonely fun" that I don't dig on.
