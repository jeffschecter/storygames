We've hit on a theme that the population expresses affection by demonstrating anger. For example, after a successful deal with a market trader, the trader yells at you and tells you to get out of his store. It doesn't mean anything, it's just how things are done.<br/><br/>Later, Tris' character is hitting on this girl. He's an outsider, she's a native of the planet. It's going well, and she's interested, so she yells abuse at him.<br/><br/>He apologises and backs off. She assumes he's not interested (if he was, he would have yelled back).<br/><br/>They meet the next morning. He smiles and apologises. She smiles and apologises too (she's less interested now).<br/><br/>This goes on a while. He becomes sick of it. He demands to know what's going on. She is irritable. He is irritable too. He yells at her. She kisses him.<br/><br/>I really like this world.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175236/#Comment_175236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T18:03:34+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  6:03PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.)

One day he was at one of their socials and an elderly man started insulting him and running him down. He was aware of the way that Greek culture worked so he started doing the same back again. When my friend had thoroughly dressed him down, the Greek guy slapped him on the back and said, "You're a good fellow.
