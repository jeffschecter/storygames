Because Lord knows the world needs another Fantasy RPG game (it does, honest!). In danger of shortselling myself I'll admit I didn't really bring a whole lot new to the table in terms of wholly original or unique mechanics, but I had a lot of fun figuring out an optimum blend of what I did use. For those in the system designy know I guess you could call it a Prime-Time Adventuresish Basic/Expert dressing over the Red Box Engine with a pepper-grinding of Fourth Edition. There's still a pretty strong DM/player line and the game's definitely more tactical compared to RBH but I think the spirit is Old School Make-it-up-as-you-go D&amp;D emergent story from exploration.<br/><br/>What I'm honestly proud of is the design and presentation, I was really shooting for John Harper-ish levels of immediate approachability and if it's had playtest success, I think that's largely why.<br/><br/>Check it oooooouuuutt! ----&gt; <a href="http://www.oldschoolhack.net/2011/01/basic-game/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldschoolhack.net/2011/01/basic-game/</a><br/><br/>I really wanted to give a shout-out to the Story-Games Forum because while I don't post a whole heck of a lot here I certainly have been lurking pretty consistently over the years and the enthusiasm, ideas and just generally infectious You-Can-Do-It attitude were pretty much the driving force behind turning this from a homebrew system into a distributable and pitchable game for anyone.<br/><br/>Happy to answer any design or process questions, of course.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308877/#Comment_308877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T16:12:22+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  4:12PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

This is way more fun to look at than most published games.  <br/><br/>It's about halfway to being my dream game text, which you can (a) learn how to play in a short read, and (b) quickly skim to find what you need.  The only catch for me is that "how to play" is fairly complicated, and winds up taking a fair amount of text to spell out.  The images and bullet points couldn't do it alone, alas.  Still, taking 25 pages to say what most games say in 100 is pretty special.<br/><br/>I <b>love</b> the venn diagram relating attributes to adventuring.<br/><br/>As for the game itself, it's kind of a weird read for me, combining stuff that I've been familiar with for 20 years with stuff that's brand new to me.  I'll have to actually read it carefully to really get it.

Many Magic Items didn't necessarily start out as such, but mundane stuff from quirky "set dressing" that players fixate on (often humorously) will sometimes get "promoted" to Magic Item status by coming up with some sort of interesting story as to why it might be.<br/><br/>Most of the sample magic items in the game rules were ones that were created by either me or the players in playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308936/#Comment_308936" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T08:55:50+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  8:55AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

"without armor")<br/>---\n<blockquote>If you\u2019re playing the Goblin, check the other players\u2019 class sheet equipment lists and claim stuff like they have.</blockquote>Huh? Might make sense later... but I'm already scratching my head, on page 3.<br/>---<br/>The class sheet concept is brilliant. I'd move the "Adventuring Goals" section to the character sheet, though--I think the class sheet should be for "canonical" notes, changes, advancements, tweaks, etc of the class, NOT a particular individual PC's goal. Yes, i realize only one player is ever each class... for THIS particular campaign. It would be cool to, at the end, have a sort of "customized" or 'tooled up" class sheet, to reuse for another, related campaign (or just start with a new, blank one for a new tone/tweak/tool-up).<br/>---<br/>It's just me, but I'd sort the talents by type (constant, arena, rested), the better to see what can be done often versus rarely.<br/>---<br/>Again, just me, but I'd present the rules, first, and make the class sheets backmatter or a much later chapter. It's hard to understand some of the jargon (and, thus, make an informed character selection) until one gets to the rules stuff.<br/>[I know, I know--that makes for a rules dump.

You'd never have a reason to do anything except Defend, since you'll get to attack anyhow and you get +2 AC out of it. By requiring that you take a hit, you've introduced an element of risk to the action. You can defend an ally, but it's going to cost you. It also limits the sheer power of being defensive.<br/><br/>A general comment about the rules: You use words/phrases like "usually," "should," "or so," and so on, with alarming frequency. More of the rules should be very concrete things: Freaky Big Monsters should always have a compound action, you should get to pick up to X number of powers (maybe 1 for every 5 HP of the baddie), doing these things requires that you feed the bowl precisely X awesome points, and so forth. I understand that the game is designed to play fast and loose, but you can't also have the rules be so fast and loose. Define more things and have us play fast and loose from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308957/#Comment_308957" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T10:41:18+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 10:41AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (The page 3 Goblin thing makes sense by the time I reach page 11--maybe do a cross-reference from p.3 to p.11; or just leave it out and let the player figure that out when they actually read their starting equipment list, eh?)<br/>---<br/>Awesome Points are awesome. I particularly like the way they're Fan Mail, but they're limited by the session (not "once per player, per scene" or anything so constricted) UNLESS the DM does a Classic Dick Move\xae, which get more APs for the players. Brilliant. However:<blockquote>...when he or she does that the DM should just own up to what\u2019s going on and put <span style="color: #CC0000;">a bunch more</span> Awesome Points in The Bowl from The Stack.</blockquote>Such vagueness will cause argument. I'd just pick a number like "one per player" or "five" to avoid such kerfuffle.<br/>---<br/>Clarify that EACH PC must spend 12 APs for the WHOLE PARTY to level up. You never use the word "each" and so there's ambiguity which suggests the group, combined, need only have spent 12. yes, even though you go on to unpack a corner case which makes it clear to all but the utterly dense (part of your target demographic, yo!):<blockquote>Sometimes there\u2019s one or two people lagging behind the rest of you, and you should keep in mind that <i>that\u2019s probably your fault for not rewarding them enough when they do something awesome</i>, so see what you can do to help with that.</blockquote>[Bit in italics is brilliant--hell, yeah, it's YOUR fault, you greedy, selfish prick! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ]<br/>---<br/>I'll join the chorus: The diagram on p.16 is very, very good work. Combining three different possible vectors for reference in one chart is pretty hard. Do you, perchance, do a lot of data visualization at your Real Job? If not, you should get a new job! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I am curious, however, why the attribute circles overlap but there's no associated example of that overlap. Do you intend to show that some challenges might be judgment calls as to which of two overlapping attributes apply; if so, who's judgment, the DM's or the PC's (which PC, in PVP)?<br/><br/>Just ONE editorial nit:<blockquote>lifting gates, opening doors</blockquote>...should be "bend bars, lift gates" to really pay proper homage. Move opening doors" over to "breaking things" because, well, it's basically the same thing (assuming a locked or barred door; otherwise, Brawn wouldn't matter).<br/>---<br/>Again, just me, but I'd have an "Arenas" heading on p.17, between the 1st and 2nd paragraphs.<br/>---<br/>I'd suggest you come up with three or four Neutral arena examples. If you can't think of one, maybe such an arena doesn't really exist (i.e. your other four types are an exhaustive list, viz a viz rule interactions/applicability). Or maybe it shouldn't be the "can\u2019t-figure-out-which-arena-this-is" arena but simply "an arena which offers no advantage or disadvantage to any weapon".<br/>[On that note: Do the arena have any other mechanical impacts, like requiring various attribute tests? It might be later in the rules, though....]<br/>---<br/>Cards: brilliant. Combat tracker, made as a segment of hex grid: inspired and genius.<br/>---<br/>LOVE the minion rules, how they can pile on, and how the APs can go up in the Bowl if the DM just WANTS to do 2. Heh-heh-heh....<br/>---\n<blockquote>Creatures have access to various Powers, which can either be Talents from the class sheets, something from the sidebar <span style="color: #0000CC;">on this page</span>, or....</blockquote>My addition in blue, for clarity.<br/>---<br/>Get rid of the gray type color, across the board. WAY too hard to read, and on p.18, you have meaty content that pertains to the reward cycle in it. I wouldn't even put flavor or example text in such dim type.<br/>---<br/>"Some Possible Powers" sidebar--I'd clean it up, somehow. Para.1 is a sentence with an adjective bolded; paras.2-5 are definitions in a definition list, the next para is sort of rambling, with the odd bold word; and the final para is a special rule regarding FBMs. It's just a bit of a mess, both for presentation and reference (IMHO).<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308958/#Comment_308958" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T10:42:47+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 10:42AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Good answer, Peter; thanks!

The later section about minions and monsters provides further clarity, but as I said, this should really be very clearly spelled out.<br/><br/>I think the intent for DM feeding of The Bowl is that they can pull off stuff just like the players can with Awesome Points, but the DM throws them into The Bowl. Just come out and say that directly.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of having something like a "That's Bullshit!" rule, where the players can call the DM out on some particularly egregious bullshit. If the DM owns up, add one AP per player to the bowl.<br/><br/>I would definitely add page directions when you talk about a concept earlier than you flesh it out. For example, on page 15, you say "when he or she does that the DM should just own up to what\u2019s going on and put a bunch more Awesome Points in The Bowl from The Stack." You should add a note at the end: "See page 18 for rules on feeding the bowl." I would also change "put a bunch more Awesome Points..." to say "Feed The Bowl with Awesome Points from The Stack." That way, you introduce the concept, the terminology, and the location for the specific rules. This also keeps the DM rules clearly separated from the player rules.<br/><br/>On page 17, you start with this: "So far all this talk about 'you' has been directed at the players." That should be introduced on page 1. Introduce the Basic Rules and the Player's Section, and make the DM's section clearly separate. Put a warning in there, <i>Dragon Strike</i>-style, that you're about to enter the realm of actually running the game. That'd help break up the rules logically, and also feed right into the old-school feel you're going for.<br/><br/>I would like to see rules for non-dungeon stuff. I sort of envision three "states" of the story of an adventuring party. You're either:<br/><br/>1. Around Town - this is where you rest, investigate, interact with NPC's, buy stuff, and find out about adventures<br/>2. On the Road - this is where you're traveling, roleplaying and interacting with the other PC's, and possibly encountering wilderness hazards<br/>3. In the Dungeon - this is where you've arrived at your adventuring destination and now have to delve and explore and such<br/><br/>These are really sort of broad ideas that inform the sorts of arenas that would exist at that particularly part of the story. It also helps to categorize the sorts of actions that are appropriate. I think it would really strengthen the game to have a page or two talking about how to run parts of the game that aren't just fighting at adventuring locales.

Yes, i realize only one player is ever each class... for THIS particular campaign. It would be cool to, at the end, have a sort of "customized" or 'tooled up" class sheet, to reuse for another, related campaign (or just start with a new, blank one for a new tone/tweak/tool-up).<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT:  Apparently I suck at trying to get quote tags to work!<br/>\n<br/>\nHowdy!  I claim no authorship of this game but I've talked with Kiznit quite a bit in person and on the forums about what makes it great from both a design and play standpoint.  I like having the Adventuring Goals on the class sheet rather than the character sheet for one important reason:  Sometimes you want those goals to be secret.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I've run OSH I print the class and character sheets as double sided.  The players need only flip the sheet over quickly to reference stuff on the class side if necessary but most of the time the character side stays face up.  By having the Adventuring Goal on the back side of the sheet it means that the player doesn't have to worry about other players seeing it if their goal is (for example):  Steal something from every other party member.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kiznit" title="kiznit"><img alt="kiznit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kiznit">kiznit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308966/#Comment_308966" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T11:56:12+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 11:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2011 11:56AM by kiznit.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TheWhaleShark</cite>One more question: can a player get multiple Awesome Points for one awesome thing?

I definitely like the mechanic of having The Bowl being a limited quantity at a time, and having its fullness contingent on the amount of bullshit the DM does. I love that cycle. It also sort of prevents player abuse of the system; by limiting the amount of reward, each player will be careful about rewarding other players and will gun to garner rewards themselves.<br/><br/>I just wanted to make sure that it was technically within the rules to do so.

Okie-doke. Not a big problem, anyway; just something that occurred to me before I knew about the secrecy of goals (and the implicit openness of the character sheet--not very old school of you, there!).<br/>-----<br/>Continuing...<br/><br/>Magic Items - anytime - I'd separate Always On from At Will; that's a MAJOR distinction (at least, to an old school HERO System player) which can also have repercussions both good and bad. At Will is clearly advantageous; but Always On can be a double-edged sword. Although... if none of the items has the "cursed" aspect of being stuck on, then they can be taken off at will and, this, there is no distinction. Huh. OK, never mind... move on... nothing to see here, I guess.<br/>---<br/>Charged - 1 in 10 chance to be mundane, even on the first roll. "Harsh but fair," as they say in Dork Tower. Maybe let the DM decide what the die is... err, but you only use d10s and d12s, right? Hmmm. I guess it works... I'd just have to be a slightly more generous DM with charged items, I think.<br/>---<br/>HAT OF MINISCULE CONJURATION - "Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat" ROAR!

Say so, if so; and provide SOME kind of structured means to make "balanced" items (this is a bit of a theme of my critique: don't leave things to fiat, even in an Old School game--it's not a homage to use fiat, nowadays. Even a BIT of advice about building items would help).<br/>---<br/>What does Grymtongue's flames do? Look cool and maybe (oh, really? when?) ignite things, or extra damage of some amount?<br/>---<br/>FILANDRIBUTH\u2019S STAFF OF DISHEVELMENT - So what? Makes the Arena Hazardous for the affected, until they take an action to fix their belt/pants? Gimme some mechanics, here (and everywhere it's reading like just some Color).<br/>---<br/>RING OF EVASION - (Repeating myself) What's the check to "manage to successfully put it on"?<br/>---<br/>STINKLEDINK\u2019S RAVENOUS COOKBOOK - Bite for how much damage? Automatically every round?<br/>---<br/>OK, the larger, takeaway point: The "magic weapons" section has the sort of mechanical meat I'm seeking. I want MORE of that. Generalize the item creation process. Maybe a "pick one from the Advantage List and one from the Disadvantage List" or similar. And that could allow for a very old-school scaling of magic items from crap with Minor Advantage and a couple of Minor (or Major!) Disadvantages to super artifacts with several Major Advantages but one Curse (Major Disadvantage). A "normal" magic item would be a single Major Advantage with a Minor Disadvantage.<br/><br/>And then you could has LISTS and TABLES! Roll or pick to build an appropriate item.... (IDEA!) OR spend Awesome Points--and the DM tosses APs into The Bowl for Disadvantages--when looting a corpse! (Dunjon might do them this way; I can't recall.

Charts and tables are very Old School, and they also provide a pretty clear guideline for going OOF the charts to make up your own shit (be sure to tell folks they can make up their own shit, too! I know, I know--I sound like I'm trying to satisfy several player types... I AM!).<br/><br/>Let us know when you have another draft and I'll give any additions it has a similar treatment. And I can tell you one thing for sure: you have at least one sale, if you expand upon the magic items section and get some cool art on your tokens. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309595/#Comment_309595" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T17:22:26+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  5:22PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please don't make all of the magic items "mechanical."

There should definitely be lists of suggested powers, or types of things that are considered appropriate for magic items. It doesn't have to be set in stone, but such lists provide wonderful <i>guidance</i>, which is far more important.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>[Also, the Dwarf belt IS "mechanical"--it has a very clear player requirement (though "being nice" can be subjective) under a very precise condition.]</blockquote>Perhaps we have a slightly different use of the word "mechanical" then. By that logic, the trousers are "mechanical;" the confer a specific advantage (comfort) under precise conditions (wearing the pants). However, that's not mechanical in the same way that a "+1 very heavy weapon" is "mechanical." I refer to the latter sort of "mechanical:" a clear-cut rule which does not require additional interpretation. Stuff like "spend one Awesome Point to add +2 to an ability roll" is an example of pure mechanics; there's no interpretation required there, and the rule will always be consistent.<br/><br/>Saying "you have to be nice to Dwarves" requires interpretation, negotiation, and application. It will not be used the same way every single time. This is not what I would call a "mechanical" effect; rather, it's a "narrative" effect that may invoke specific applications of the game's mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309753/#Comment_309753" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T11:34:08+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 11:34AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will say that I sometimes act like I have blinders on when there's a detailed mechanical effect attached to something, so I couldn't use it in a creative way.

I love the presentation (although a few pages were hard to skim visually: there's a lot of stuff without a clear sequence, so sometimes it's hard to find the one thing you're looking for on that page without reading through everything).<br/><br/>It's interesting how this "hack" takes Red Box Hack and then kinda reverse-hacks into an "old-school" game that's also clearly heavily inspired by "modern" dungeon crawl games (D&amp;D 4E, etc).<br/><br/>I have to say I agree with the comments about a lack of guidance in some of the mechanical choices: for example, it's very frustrating for me to read something like, "when this happens, throw a bunch of points into the Bowl". You've written this game and playtested it, right? So I want to know what kinds of quantities you throw in when it works well. Otherwise I have to figure it out by trial and error. I love when game designers explain this kind of thing: "You'll normally want to throw in two Awesome Points, but if the moment is a critical one for the character, then throw in three. On the other hand, if the fight is going poorly for the group, and it looks like no one's having fun, throw in just one." This sort of thing is helpful because: a) there is a default for when you don't know, or are playing the game for the first time, and b) someone's played the game and passed on what they've learned about how to get the mechanics to work right.<br/><br/>There's a lot of stuff like that in the text that's potentially frustrating. If I play it and it doesn't work, is it because it's a bad design or because I chose to throw in too many or too few points? I can't tell. (Remember, I'm playing for the first time, and you haven't given me any "default settings" to work with.)<br/><br/>On the entirely other hand, I agree with John Harper: one thing I love about old-school games and Red Box Hack is the purely descriptive fictional material, like Talents that just describe what they do. There is so much flavour and so many interesting fictional implications to a lot of the stuff in the original Hack that's not there in this version. For instance, a Talent like, "You can do <i>anything</i> you can do, and do it while running," gives the players room to be creative and come up with interesting uses for that Talent that "+1 to damage while taking a double-speed 'Run' action" doesn't.<br/><br/>In the same way, maybe I'm anti-old school, but I find that the classes ("Fighter", "Thief", etc) and most of the Talents just have a little less flavour and a little less special-ness than the Red Box Hack originals. I see a lot more combat-oriented Talents and a lot less of the interesting ones like Homunculus or Dream Thief. That's probably exactly what you're trying to do, but it jumps out at me as a disadvantage. <br/><br/>Along the same lines, I'm curious as to why you decided to get rid of Showing Off and "danger rolls"? Do they just not fit your vision of this game, or did you play Red Box Hack and find that they didn't work terribly well?<br/><br/>Lots of praise has been thrown your way, so my post is kind of negative, but please understand that it's only in the spirit of showing my interest and excitement in this game. Great stuff!<br/><br/><i><br/>(Also: How come I never realized before that Playbooks in Apocalypse World, and the way AW character-specific moves work, look like they're straight out of Red Box Hack? Vincent lists XXXXtreme Luge as the influence in the book, which I haven't seen. Does that game also have a bunch of Playbooks/classes, each with a list of Talents/moves, and allow you to take new moves from other Playbooks/classes as you advance? Did Red Box Hack take that concept from XXXXtreme Luge?)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309763/#Comment_309763" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T12:25:31+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 12:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2011 12:26PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also!<br/><br/>Exactly this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Whoa.

Think about it this way. You start a session with X Awesome Points to go around. The only way to get more Awesome Points in The Bowl is for the DM to screw you with some patented egregious DM bullshit. If the DM never pulls any, no more points. So, the DM can completely control the flow of Awesome Points and thus the pace of the game.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the players are all competing over the same limited pool of Awesome Points. However, they can't compete <i>too</i> hard, because everyone needs everyone else to get enough AP; additionally, because the points are awarded by other players, you are encouraged to reward each other while simultaneously gunning for your own reward as hard as possible.<br/><br/>This creates a semi-adversarial relationship with the DM (who is, after all, the guy in charge of monsters) and a competitive/cooperative mechanic among the players (which is totally awesome). The combination of these two factors color the story in a very particular way; they encourage all of the players to push each other to ridiculous heights, while the DM is constantly balancing the need to amp up the challenge with the desire to rein in his group's rate of advancement.<br/><br/>This creates a totally awesome flow of action in the game.<br/><br/>Showing Off allows you to <i>completely</i> bypass this economy, and turns the game into one of parallel play, rather than awesome collaborative play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309779/#Comment_309779" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T13:23:29+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  1:23PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed!<br/><br/>But some kind of "lateral" combat move could still be interesting.

Literally. Just me and my teenage Autistic nephew. Huh. We designed a dungeon using Tony's masterpiece together, taking turns to roll dice and spout shit about the evolving lair of the sulphur dragon.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce that was done, he created an Elf 'Jacob' whose adventuring goal was to defeat the Sulphur dragon and take all of his misbegotten treasure! "Really? a starting out adventurer with such lofty ambition. Well, O.K!' We used the Venn diagram to show potentially what stats effected the sort of narrative control you wanted in the fiction (ala Donjon), failure allowing me to complicate things drastically and adding plenty of awesome to the bowl. <br/>\n<br/>\nConversely, being one-on-one Locky stepped up and took some AP from the bowl and gave me some AP for my stack when he got to narrate some cool elf shit leaping on orc shields and sliding down stairs while pinging off nasties in the wings (Legolas anyone?) on a successful daring roll that used lots of  his own AP. He simply said 'thanks for letting do that, it was awesome!'<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, we only investigated a few 'arenas' in the dungeon (we kept calling them areas, since they were analogous to areas of the map we created), but we had a blast. It really, really, really brought back memories of old school explore the dungeon and see what's around the corner and freak out sort of roleplay from my childhood. Unfortunately Locky had to head back home (interstate), but he's looking forward to playing again soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would second the various comments that suggest being mechanically explicit about AP, damage, GM / Player responsibility etc. That would really help.  I like David's ideas on layout and format too - perhaps with a combat and a non combat example of resolution thrown in? I like the idea of magic items being buildable and mechanical. On the proviso that the player add the appropriate colour. 'Oh so you have a +1 sword? What makes it a +1 sword? What's it called? What's its shtick?'<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, brilliant game, and I'd love to run it back to back with a Dungeon World game  in the same dungeon to compare them!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310023/#Comment_310023" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T06:39:11+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  6:39AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just going to add my voice to the chorus of "great fun to read, would like to play." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kruug" title="kruug"><img alt="kruug" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kruug">kruug</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310052/#Comment_310052" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T09:10:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  9:10AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2011 9:11AM by kruug.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Noofy</cite>We designed a dungeon using Tony's masterpiece together, taking turns to roll dice and spout shit about the evolving lair of the sulphur dragon.</blockquote>\nWhat is this "Tony's masterpiece" you speak of?
