                    I am conducting a mental exercise.  Specifically, I am deconstructing such 'classic' FRPGs as Dungeons and Dragons or Tunnels and Trolls.<br/>
<br/>
One of the appealing features of these games is the ability to choose to play non-human species.  And along with that choice, obtain adjustments to specific attributes.  (Ignore, for the moment the other relative advantages and disadvantages of choosing other species and just focus on attributes.)  <br/>
<br/>
To my mind, the racial attribute adjustment makes the most sense under the scenario of random attribute generation.  If I choose to play an Ogre (naturally really strong, but also really dumb), and roll a low Strength and high intelligence at random, racial attribute adjustments bring the character back in-line (in some sense).  He may still be weak relative to Ogres, but mighty mighty compared to the pixie played by one of the other characters. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if I can assign my attributes this adjustment becomes somewhat unnecessary.  Now suppose I want to make a Pixie (who tend to be physically weak, but really intelligent).  If I want to make a 'typical' Pixie, I can merely assign fewer points to Strength and more to Intelligence; while if an brutish Pixie thug is more to my liking, I can do the opposite, perhaps with some guidance from the rest of the play group to keep things reasonable.  <br/>
<br/>
This is my perspective.  Am I missing something inherent? I recognize that specific games may make it impossible to get a 19 Int without racial adjustment, but ignore that for now.  I guess my core question is "Do you need to have random attribute generation to make validate the use of racial attribute adjustments?"<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in your thoughts and perspectives on this topic.                </div>

                            Based off of the literally thousands of threads at EN World regarding racial balance and some dozens I've seen discussing the pros and cons of specific race/class combinations, I'd have to say that even with non-random stat generation that the racial bonuses/penalties DO affect what players choose. Just check the Pimp My Blackguard thread for an example (although for a non-racial example). I believe the quote was '+2 to strength is too much to miss'.<br/><br/>Is that what you're asking for?                        </div>

                            I'm not sure exactly what you're after with this "deconstruction."  Are you looking at what creates a good/interesting FRPG, looking at why certain things have been popular, or...?<br/><br/>As for attributes, it seems like pushing back an otherwise hard limit would be just as appealing a reason to choose another "race." Like, even my super-strong barbarian human can only be STR 20, say, but if I get a Minotaur instead, I can buy him up to 30. And this certainly works without random generation. Or, as another alternative, have different costs of attribute-increase: I can raise a human's STR by 1 for 1 pt., but a Minotaur's by 2 for 1 pt.<br/><br/>Is this what you were looking for?<br/><br/>(As it happens, I was just thinking about fantasy races this morning, though in a different way. I've made a new thread.)                        </div>

                            In many fantasy games the races end up becoming templates or archetypes as much or more than "races." In D&amp;D, for example, you know pretty quick what Dwarves are good at, why Half-Orcs rock, and why Half-Elves bite. You also know what their racial abilities do, when you should use one, and what their roll in the party will be. ("Make the elf move around the room to see if there are secret doors!") <br/><br/>Linked in with that is the racial stat modifiers, which help to min-max your character to hit the maximum efficiency at the part you are playing. If you're going to be the front line warrior, then get the +2 Str because its too good to miss. If you're wanting the be the archer of doom, then that Dex bonus will rock your world. <br/><br/>All this, of course, represents a sort of gamist take on the issue. If you're trying to make your character effective and your group monstrously unstoppable, then you need to take these things into account. They give you tools to build your platform for stepping on up.<br/><br/>However, your statement of "If I want to make a 'typical' Pixie, I can merely assign fewer points to Strength and more to Intelligence" seems to be pointing out some degree of Sim agenda -- the point of the racial attributes in one kind of sim isn't to max out your character effectiveness but to make either a typal or counter-typal member of the race the "way they should be." Many games that take that element as a primary focus do not have racial attribute mods -- though they may have racial minimums and maximums. This is because in that view you aren't taking a racial type to max out your effect, but to play to a certain type. And as you can spend your points to type, there isn't a point to the bonuses. <br/><br/>Then, there are the vast numbers of games that do both at the same time. And confusion results.                        </div>

                            In some games, race doesn't modify attributes, but is an attribute of its own.<br/>
<br/>
In the Dogs/Jedi game I just started, I told the players that if they want to play a race with some special ability, just make that race a trait.  "Wookiee 2d10" says a lot about a character, but perhaps "Wookiee 2d4" says even more.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I'm not trying to negate anything said previously; Brand's quite right.                        </div>

                            Well, Heroquest doesn't go quite that far, because the keywords have traits below them that are buyable on their own; an ogre might include "Strong 2W" but a human could buy that, too.                        </div>
