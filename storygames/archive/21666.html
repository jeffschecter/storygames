Its back and features no less than 73 projects.<br/><br/>You might like to take a look at the German projects, as <b>Die Vergessenen Chroniken \u2013 Nothing Stays Forgotten</b> aims to finance the English translation of a German tabletop rpg. If you are a fan of Fate you might as well like to glance at <b>Drei Abenteuerwelten</b>, a sourcebook offering three \u201agerman\u2018 settings for Fate Core.<br/><br/>There are plenty more role-playing games. Like <b>Agents of Concordia</b> and <b>Interbellum RPG</b>. Both games offer a kind of \u201aalternate history\u2018 setting and sprinkle in a bit of fantasy. I am quite fascinated by Concordias art-deko approach and thefirst World War theme of Interbellum and will take a closer look late on.<br/>In regards to the fantasy rpg I am most fascinated and curious about <b>Scales &amp; Tales</b> and <b>ORC STABR</b>. I do like Scales box-set approach, light approach and its accessibility for kids. Whereas STABR seems to be a quite funny, little and quite minimal rpg.<br/>Amon the urban fantasy games you\u2019ll find the second edition of <b>Part-Time Gods</b> and the d6 system based <b>Necrotopia</b>. Among the superheroe games there is IS IT A PLANE!? and SuperAge.<br/>Well, and there is a peak of gm-less games. I think I\u2019ve never seen so many started in close proximity to each other. <b>Dream Askew // Dream Apart</b> starts by basically being \u201etwo games in one (Kickstarter)\u201c and I am most fascinated by the idea of a setting that\u2019s described as \u201eJewish fantasy of the shtetl\u201c. <b>Archives of the Sky</b> does offer an interesting science fiction setting and <b>BFF</b> is a game all bout friendships. Last but not least there is <b>Children of the Fall</b>, a game in which you play children who survived into a post-apocalyptic world.<br/>There are many, many more projects. Like I personally am fascinted by the <b>dJAM</b> dice and I do really like to mention the Patreon for the <b>On A Roll</b>, there are as well many cool notebooks, a drawing book and many, many more.
