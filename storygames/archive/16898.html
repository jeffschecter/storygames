On a 10+ your theorem needs 3 results and choose two options from the first list, on a 7-9 your theorem needs 5 results and choose one option from each list.: \n<ul><li>Trivial - this proof requires 1 fewer result.</li>\n<li>Proof by Construction - when proved this theorem has created something concrete, get 3 hold, when you use what this theorem has created, spend 1 hold to get +1 forward.</li>\n<li>Proof by Induction - when you have a result that sets up ground work for this theorem you can use it as a base case, instead of proving this theorem. Each base case adds +1 forward to proving this theorem.</li>\n<li>Proof by Contradiction - when you prove this theorem, describe how it turns a problem into an advantage, then converts one of your CARDs into a result.</li></ul>On a miss, your theorem needs 8 results, choose two options below:\n<ul><li>Proof by Exhaustion - your theorem needs +4 results</li>\n<li>Describe how this theorem puts you at risk - take that risk as a CARD (Complication, Antagonist, Risk, or Debt).</li>\n<li>Describe someone who is actively trying to block your theorem - the theorem takes that person's enmity as a CARD.</li>\n<li>Describe someone you are relying upon to prove your theorem - the theorem takes that debt as a CARD.</li>\n<li>Describe an unpredictable event your theorem depends on or is threatened by - the theorem takes that risk as a CARD.</li></ul>\nWhen you <b>achieve a result which could prove a theorem</b>, roll +Rigorous. On a 10+, reduce the theorem's need by two. On a 7-9, reduce the theorem's need by one, or reduce its need by two and describe a risk or complication your result could cause and add it to the theorem as a CARD. On a miss, describe how your result makes the theorem less likely after all, and add this reason to the theorem as a CARD. <br/><br/>When you <b>achieve a result which could disprove a theorem</b>, roll +Rigorous. On a 10+, apply this result to the theorem as a CARD. On a 7-9, either shake-up this theorem or the result is double edged and both you and the theorem take it as a CARD. On a miss, your attempted disproof only strengthens the theorem, reducing its need by one (to a minimum of one). <br/><br/>When you <b>apply a proven theorem to prove another theorem</b>, describe how the proved theorem helps support the unproven one, then roll +Creative. On a hit, treat the proven theorem as a result and attempt to prove the unproven theorem. On a 10+, the proven theorem is a Lemma and gains 2 hold. This hold may be spent by a mathematician to use this theorem as a result, by describing how it supports an unproven theorem. On a 7-9 this theorem generates the result as a Corollary, but may still be used again using this move. On a miss this theorem is exhausted and this move cannot be used on it again.<br/><br/>When you <b>state a conjecture</b>, briefly sketch your speculation or plan, then roll +Creative. On a hit, whenever another mathematician states or proves a theorem which fulfills this conjecture, they mark one experience. On a 10+, those mathematicians gain +1 forward on those rolls. On a miss, describe a complication with your idea, any theorem which fulfills your conjecture takes that complication as a CARD. <br/><br/>When you or your theorem <b>gains a CARD</b> or <b>is shaken-up</b>, roll +CARD [which will always be +6 minus the number of CARDs in your House, including the one just gained]. On a 10+, all is clear, for now. On a 7-9, choose one of your CARDs to rear its head. On a miss, the House of Cards falls down and all of the CARDs come due at once. If the House belonged to a theorem it has proven false. If it belongs to you then you have landed in serious trouble, lose all your cards and state a theorem to get you out of it, until you prove such a theorem you cannot prove on any other theorem. <br/><br/>At the <b>end of a conference</b>, you mark one experience for each CARD in your House. If your House is currently fallen, then you are assumed to weasel your way out of your trouble before the next conference.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385107/#Comment_385107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-14T00:19:45+00:00" title="July 14, 2012 12:19AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally not <i>actually</i> contributing to the conversation, but... wow.

This mathematician describes the setting of the conference, briefly mentioning its location (usually a city), and some things of interest in or near the conference. Then each mathematician writes down one <i>open problem</i>, a difficult situation or prize that will require an especially complex theorem to solve. The mathematicians place all of these in a pile. Then the guest of honor directs each other mathematician to select one open problem from someone else. These will be the open problems of the conference. The goal of the conference will be for the mathematicians to prove theorems solving one or more of these open problems. Theorems of this sort work a little differently:\n<ul><li>When stating a theorem that solves an open problem, add 5 to its need.</li>\n<li>When you apply a result to prove a theorem solving an open problem, on a hit, if this result was a proven theorem, reduce the need by an additional 1.</li>\n<li>When you successfully prove a theorem solving an open problem, all other stated theorems solving that problem are proven false. This does not prohibit stating a new theorem to solve the same problem.</li></ul>\nA conference is made up of a series of sessions. During each session each mathematician takes a turn, and then chooses which of the mathematicians who haven't taken a turn yet this session does so next. The last mathematician in a session chooses the first for the following session. In the very first session of the conference, the guest of honor takes the first turn.<br/><br/>The duration of the conference is determined by the conference clock, which starts at 0, and counts up to twice the number of attending mathematicians. During a conference there are a handful of <i>conference moves</i> (see below). The first time in a session that a conference move is used, the conference clock increases by 1. The clock also increases by 1 each time a theorem solving an open problem is successfully proven. When the clock equals or exceeds twice the number of attending mathematicians, the conference will end at the end of the current session.<br/><br/>When you use a conference move as the guest of honor, you get an additional +1 to your roll.<br/><br/>When you <b>present your work <i>at a conference</i></b>, roll +Elegant. On a hit, you sneak something into your presentation about one of the stated theorems, gain +1 forward to using results or theorems to prove or disprove that theorem. On a 10+ you may add one benefit to the theorem (except Trivial). On a 6-, you are instead distracted by the research you are presenting, take a CARD describing this fixation.<br/><br/>When you <b>take part in informal discussions <i>at a conference</i></b>, roll +Creative. On a hit, you relax and get some perspective on things, remove any one CARD from your House. On a 10+ you also get +1 forward. On a 6-, you are distracted by someone's idea or problem, take a CARD describing this preoccupation.<br/><br/>When you <b>badmouth a colleague <i>at a conference</i></b>, roll +Cold. On a 10+, give them a CARD describing how attendees at the conference have taken a dislike to your colleague. On a 7-9, give them the CARD, but you attract some ire from the attendees too, your House is shaken-up. On a miss, your gossiping backfires, take a CARD representing the distrust you've earned. <br/><br/>When you <b>network among attendees <i>at a conference</i></b>, roll +Hot. On a 10+, get 3 hold, on a 7-9, get 1 hold. Spend hold, one for one, to gain +1 forward when an attendee knowingly or unknowingly helps you during a move. This hold lasts for the rest of the conference. On a miss, you make an enemy instead of friends and contacts, take this enemy as a CARD.<br/><br/>During your turn:\n<ul><li>You describe what your character is doing. </li>\n<li>Always refer to other mathematicians by the character's name. </li>\n<li>Solve the open problems.</li>\n<li>Build your House of CARDs.</li>\n<li>To use a move, describe how you are doing what the move requires.</li>\n<li>You may initiate two moves during your turn. After the second move, your turn ends, and you choose whose turn it is next. This doesn't count moves that follow-up your initial move, like using results to prove theorems or handling the consequences to Houses of CARDs.</li></ul>\n - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386040/#Comment_386040" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T08:17:04+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  8:17AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Definition 1</b>: Squaring the Circle is the proven impossible task of constructing the square of the same area as a circle using only a finite number of steps with a compass and straight edge. <br/><br/><b>Definition 2</b>: Squaring the Circle is also mathematical slang for an enticingly difficult challenge, which may or may not be possible.<br/><br/><b>Theorem 1</b>: Squaring the Circle is a game which merges the genres of academic mathematics and thieves on high risk heists. <br/><i>Proof</i> :  In Squaring the Circle you choose a branch of mathematics and a type of thief, joining them together to build your mathematician. As top mathematicians you are routinely invited to various conferences all over the world. But simply exploring non-trivial consequences of the full Taniyama-Shimura conjecture isn't enough for you and your colleagues. Sometimes you want to relax by tackling seemingly impossible jobs, like stealing the crown jewels, seducing the head of the national bank, or bankrupting a vicious and powerful CEO. These are <i>open problems</i>, and you and your colleagues will work together and at odds to achieve these squarings of circles. <br/><br/><b>Theorem 2</b>: Squaring the Circle is powered by the <i>Apocalypse World</i> engine. It is built around a series of <i>moves</i>, self-contained mechanics which are linked to fictional situations. <br/><i>Proof</i> : See Vincent Baker's <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>Apocalypse World</i></a><br/><br/><b>Definition 3</b>: When dice are rolled in Squaring the Circle it is describe as "roll +X".  Always roll two six-sided dice and add them together, plus whatever stat or value is indicated by "X", in addition to any other modifiers from past moves.  If that total is 7 or higher, it is a hit. A 10 or more is especially good, while a 7-9 often produces a mixed result. Lastly, a 6 or below on the total, indicates a miss, where something bad can happen. <br/><br/><b>Aside</b>: Squaring the Circle has been designed by Mendel Schmiedekamp.<br/><br/><b>Theorem 3</b>: Squaring the Circle is played without a Master of Ceremonies. <br/><i>Proof</i> : As you play Squaring the Circle, you will state theorems which can lead to solving the open problems you have decided to attempt. To prove these theorems and thus achieve their goals, you must achieve <i>results</i>, actions in the story which support the goal of the theorem you are proving. The moves for creating theorems and proving them determine how you fair in your attempts to prove a theorem. When you encounter trouble it comes in the form of Complications, Antagonists, Risks, or Debts (CARDs). These form a House of CARDs, for both mathematicians and theorems. These Houses describe all the trouble that your mathematicians is juggling, and if they fall down all of their CARDs come due. Together theorems provide a way to achieve the seemingly impossible and Houses of CARDs provide the threat and rewards of that challenge. A game of Squaring the Circle is the interplay between these two forces with your mathematicians right in the middle. <br/><br/><b>Theorem 4</b>: To play a game of Squaring the Circle, you create mathematicians by joining a Mathematician playbook with a Thief playbook, selecting among your options on each sheet. Then choose, perhaps randomly, a guest of honor and begin your first a conference.<br/><i>Proof</i> : An Exercise for the Reader.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386385/#Comment_386385" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T20:13:31+00:00" title="August  4, 2012  8:13PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But with no Nobel Prize up for grabs, how does it end?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/juliusz" title="juliusz"><img alt="juliusz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/juliusz">juliusz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386403/#Comment_386403" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-05T06:49:18+00:00" title="August  5, 2012  6:49AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With Fields, of course.<br/><br/>I want pdf version of this one!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386458/#Comment_386458" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T09:23:30+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  9:23AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The pdf is <a href="http://www.archimedes-closet.com/artemisia/gamesgalore/SquaringCircle.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, on my <a href="http://www.archimedes-closet.com/artemisia/gamesgalore/index.html" rel="nofollow">Games Galore page</a>.<br/><br/>I, for one, don't truck with the notion that a mathematician's life is over once she or he turns 40.
