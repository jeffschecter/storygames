It seems that while its not the most wide spread trope from monster and horror inspired stuff but it is there. <br/><br/>So I made this, The Ordained. Its your basic Priest who performs exorcisms archetype, but a little more generalized as a monster hunter.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6V1QEnf-U00V1VLWE5BRmVPelE/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6V1QEnf-U00V1VLWE5BRmVPelE/view?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>I thought it would go quicker but I had a little trouble considering that many of the obvious priest like things are already sprinkled throughout in other playbooks. The Initiate and the Expert could totally be played like a priest if someone was so inclined. So I just embraced that fact and made it so that it automatically multi classes a little. Let me know if anyone plays it. This was just an exercise, and I made for my girlfriend who has cool ideas I like to implement. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Kenny                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456874/#Comment_456874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-05T00:15:13+00:00" title="October  5, 2016 12:15AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks good, and nicely differentiated from the other potentially religious hunters.

That being said decided to go ahead and make a strait Priest type anyways, and did my best to make it embody the trope.\n<blockquote><br/>That said, I'm not super sure I endorse all the picking and choosing from other playbooks.

And I take your concern to heart. I altered the text a little to say that the haven <i>is</i> a church and you get only one option (suggesting they pick protection spells would be super appropriate). Beyond that my advice is to only allow a player to take something that's not currently in play. I wouldn't recommend playing this class <i>and</i> the initiate. Unless they want to play up the distinction in an interesting way. (the same goes for expert, divine, wronged ect.)\n<blockquote><br/>You definitely do need to do some proofreading.
