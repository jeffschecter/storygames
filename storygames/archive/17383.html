Is it that rules-based play should die out?</blockquote>\nNope. For me it is that just as once the GM was seen as a necessary component to rpgs, but now we understand different ways to do the same thing. So too do we (I would say) see a solid, unchanging set of rules as a requirement to play, and don't necessarily pay attention to the connections and communications between the players as a fundamental part of what makes it all work. The game questions that, and lays out some ideas on another approach. One that borrow liberally from acting, tabletop rp (of all types), and various live play traditions (freeform and larp). <br/><br/>GMless games haven't killed GM'd games. Killing the rules in your play doesn't detract from their utility in other games. But both things question the assumption of their necessity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393909/#Comment_393909" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T10:14:47+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 10:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll reply to the comments about our intro in a day or two.

The actual vibe going on was more like people wanted to do rotating, non-group scenes ( Kinda a <i>Night in The Unlife of Character X</i>) that really didn't call for the mechanics in the book.<br/><br/>We'd probably have been a whole lot better off having something like this handy, with just plain understood permission/invitation to grab stuff like this that worked and run with it, just using the fiction-concepts from the game to wrap around the mini sessions using this kind of stuff, pulled together as appropriate.<br/><br/>On a weird personal side note, earlier this last week, I was trying to describe what essentially amounts to structured freeform techniques as applied to minis using play.

There are tons of games that get me <i>somewhat</i> excited.  I'm <i>curious</i> about just about every game I've ever heard of.  But I don't get that "must play now!" feeling.<br/><br/>Well, I got it with Play With Intent.<br/><br/>If I had the right group to do this with, it's conceivable that I would want to do this and no other roleplaying for a good long time.<br/><br/>If there's anything I can contribute to this, please let me know.  I have some organizational thoughts on the PDF, but don't know if that's helpful right now.  I also have some dialogue techniques I'm rather fond of which pertain to the flow of information about the fiction, but they were developed in a one-GM context, so might not be a perfect fit.<br/><br/>If I ever see either of you at a con, please, let's do this fantastic non-game activity.

It's supposed to be creepy, and a bit sad, with the customers slowly tasting the complexity of a mortal's life, played out through vignettes as the peson moves from a state of being idealistic and artistic and is slowly worn down by time and circumstance ( all engineered by the vintner) until a fine drink is produced.<br/><br/>It gives me ideas for tabletop extravaganza games with an emphasis in miniatures that aren't standard toy soldier battle games. Pretty much the bulk of my old [minis+] threads are touching on that idea one way or another, and Play with intent gives me some ideas on how to do that, and also some ideas on warm ups and tools to help with that, including ways to run them that are more scene based. Off hand?<br/><br/><i>Welcome Back, Drac</i>: A comedy piece set in Transylvania. Dracula returns home and everything is a mess. he just wants some peace and quiet, but the romantic hijinks of the vllagers and the schemes of new monsters and humans in the neighborhood throw all of his plans for quiet retirement into disarray.<br/><br/><i>Race for the Goblin Throne</i>: Played over the course of a year of scale time and over about three hours of real time. The Election Year Campaigning is on. Party politics, single issue voters, undecided zombie hordes, political dirty tricks, coalition building, poltical paybacks, surprise invasions by humans, and backroom deals all go into deciding who will occupy the Big Chair for the next century. Will it be those Hollywood Monsters and their human loving (ish) ways, or will the discredited GOOP ( Great Old Ones Party) regain the seat now that the stars finally seem to be right? And what about the down ticket races?<br/><br/><i>In Another October</i>: Based on Roger Zelazny's <i>A Night in the Lonesome October</i>, but with a changed setting. Eccentric figures from history and literature come to a small town with their animal companions. Some are Openers, some are Closers, and no one knows who is who. There are some surprise, unaligned, ringers in there too. Partnerships are made and everyone is seeking the tools and location info that will let their side win this time, either keeping the world as it is or changing it forever.<br/><br/><i>The Occupation</i>: The Germans have occupied your home. Do you collaborate or resist? What about those around you? Who will look out for themselves first and foremost? If you resist, how do you do it? What about the outside influences who use you as pawns, or the infighting between factions? And what about the occupiers? Could turn out a tragedy, could turn out like <i>'Allo, 'Allo</i>.<br/><br/>That kinda stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394803/#Comment_394803" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T13:42:44+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  1:42PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, alas, I'm even farther from NYC than you are.

Part of the idea is for the session to funnel in on the story of the eventually chosen victim/vintage, and people would use their own experiences with disappointments and obstructions in their own lives to inform the fiction. Hopefully done right, the vignettes develop the story of the vintage, while the personalities of the vampires blur in and out, and people switch between roles.<br/><br/>Another part of the concept is that the vampires themselves choose the particular vintage that develops through play because they too have a parallel story in their background.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394912/#Comment_394912" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T09:13:52+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  9:13AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, that sounds like a very interesting setup.
