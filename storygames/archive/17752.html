Without the artwork, they'll still be the new Sorcerer, but only in PDF and with plain covers. Stretching past the goal ($2000) means more formats, including physical books, eBooks, and a fancy edition. Various nifty things are awarded to different pledge levels, but I've tried to keep it simpler and less flashy than many Kickstarts.<br/><br/>The project isn't live yet, and I'm hoping some of you will help me refine it a bit. I still have to add Thomas' sample art, a couple more informational videos (which is why I don't have tons of text to introduce the game to newcomers), and I suppose some kewl names for the different pledge levels. I appreciate all constructive input.<br/><br/>The preview link: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/847190685/1935975693?token=2c1f9f60" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/847190685/1935975693?token=2c1f9f60</a><br/><br/>Best, Ron                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401821/#Comment_401821" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T08:04:46+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  8:04AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, your stretch goals only go to $5K.

I have very modest expectations. I can think of a couple of things, if we (you're supposed to say "we," you know, community-building) make way more than $5000, then I should probably offer much more generous terms for the fancy book, for example. I don't want to promise any of that, though, because I have a very keen sense of lurking disaster when it comes to RPG publishing, and never plan for more than one layer ahead of my current knowledge. If I were to be hit with, for example, the equivalent of the Tundra meltdown in 2003 or the Key 20 meltdown in 2007 or so, then excess funds would simply keep Adept alive. Such disasters breed especially well in the shadows of producing a new fancy book, for instance.<br/><br/>I really am doing this kickstart for the stated goals, to get me through a difficult organizational moment. It's not a front for trying to make a million bucks, and it's not the foundation of my business model going forward. My definition of success is merely meeting the goal, not some giddy hope for breaking Kickstarter records and not a desire to impress people by raking in unbelievable amounts.<br/><br/>Another way to look at it is, you can always see whether the goal has been met or exceeded, so you don't have to pledge if you don't see the point of throwing money on top of the pile. If you do go ahead and pledge after that point, I say, "Many thanks to you, for helping Adept Press through whatever disaster is lurking," and also, "You are a very nice person" ... and uh, well, then I keep all the money. I've never turned Adept profits toward anything non-Adept though, so at least you know that money goes toward new things later. Those new things include the religion games (which I think you'd really like, Chris), The People's Hero at long last, and an interesting reboot of my vicious and furious heartbreaker from twenty years ago.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly understanding what you mean by "just" giving drink recipes. I plan to post a menu publicly by the indicated date, with however many drinks people pledged for. Every recipe will include the type and brand of tequila I used to make it, 'cause that matters. Does that answer your question? (Maybe I should clarify that I will actually invent the drinks, not loot them from cocktail books or sites.)<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401825/#Comment_401825" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T08:35:28+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  8:35AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2012 8:43AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at the details, how about putting those two silhouette images side by side?  I think that would flow better and seem less hastily constructed.<br/><br/>Also, determining the specific ebook formats you'd be doing matters to those customers who care about it at all. For example, I'd be happy with EPUB, while e.g. Apple iBook would be useless for me (unless I convert it myself, of course). It's a secondary enough detail that it doesn't need to be known when the funding period begins, but there should probably be some clarity on this once you hit the first milestone or so, if the stretch goal is to do any work in encouraging people to participate in funding.<br/><br/>An important functional point is that as I understand it, Kickstarter can enforce limits on specific pledge levels. You've written out in one of the pledge levels that it's limited to 10 copies, but haven't apparently set the flag in question. I haven't used Kickstarter myself, so I don't know how the enforced limitation is done, but it's probably a good idea to use that to actually prevent people from putting in more orders for limited items.<br/><br/>Were I writing the description, I would put the main facts more clearly front and center. From the customer viewpoint the central attraction is that paying anything above $25 gets you the new books in PDF format, and there are no other formats available at this point, but if the Kickstarter goes well there'll be an opportunity to buy the books on paper later. This could be mentioned somewhere aside from the pledge level descriptions, I think.<br/><br/>Content-wise it seems that we're pretty much where you want to be, insofar as I understand the goals here. I don't imagine that it'll be difficult to hit these benchmarks, assuming that the Kickstarter is publicized at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP" title="JimLotFP"><img alt="JimLotFP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">JimLotFP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401827/#Comment_401827" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T09:30:24+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  9:30AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorcerer and Ron Edwards are names people know... probably not hitting FATE or Glorantha levels of success, but there are going to be a significant number of people who will buy into this.<br/><br/>That in mind, this whole Kickstarter seems underambitious to the point of lunacy with some misplaced priorities on top of that.

Part of what Kickstarter does is let people monetize their personal social network in the service of a creative project and you've been building up yours for over a decade. This project will likely hit $10,000 instantly and then soar upwards from there, based on your reputation and years of service to the indie games community. Being prepared for success is nearly as important as being prepared for failure. If you're not interested in fancy stretch goals, then cool, but there's definitely room for this to be a big deal. That involves more planning from the get-go, however, and being ready to roll out new rewards when the first few are breezed through.<br/><br/>If you really don't want this to be the "show Ron how much you appreciate him (and Sorcerer specifically)" Kickstarter, then it may be important to be clear about that up front and mention that any excess funding will go toward future projects (and maybe even mention what those are).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401832/#Comment_401832" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T10:08:40+00:00" title="December 27, 2012 10:08AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would agree with you, Jonathan, if this was an ordinarily formed Kickstarter. Ron's done his best to drop the ordinary customer out of the loop here, though: the guy who just wants to get a good deal on an exciting product is probably better off waiting for the smoke to clear so they can just buy the book when it's printed. That is, unless they're particular aficionados of tequila. We well might see mainly 1st-order colleagues and friends putting money into this, as the ordinary customer might not be fired up by the pledge levels available. Of course in Ron's case that's still going to be numbers that surpass his own modest expectations, if I'm any judge. I'm considering putting money into this, and I don't even drink.<br/><br/>I guess we will need a betting pool for where this Kickstarter's going to end up.

My guess is that, if I did not already know you and Sorcerer, I would be underwhelmed by the production effort and bored to tears waiting for the relevant information to arrive (which it does, but too slowly).  Depending on who you hope to reach, you might not need to bother, but if you're interested in widening the net, I'd recommend a video of 2 minutes or less, with few shots lasting over a handful of seconds, showing some physical books, some actual play, and some of Thomas's art.<br/><br/>If I were you, I'd write a bullet-point script to streamline the message, for example:<br/>10-20 seconds:<br/>- time for new Sorcerer PDFs<br/>- look, new content, all done!<br/>- help me make it look pretty!<br/>- Thomas is a badass<br/>20-40 seconds:<br/>- I'll now describe Sorcerer, and then the new content<br/>- Sorcerer is about W<br/>- the experience of playing Sorcerer is like X<br/>- the new content is Y<br/>- reading the new content will get you Z<br/>a minute or less:<br/>- here's the timetable for<br/>-- when the Kickstarter ends<br/>-- when the art is finished<br/>-- when I send you your PDF<br/>-- when I send you your hardcopy<br/>- whatever else you feel is necessary<br/>- sign off<br/><br/><b>The product info:</b><br/><br/>Why do I want your annotations?  You say you'll share what you've learned from playing it for 15 years, but I don't know whether that will be:<br/>- Using Sorcerer AP to illustrate of justify Forge or theory stuff<br/>- Entertaining AP for our reading pleasure<br/>- Ron's deep thoughts on life and art<br/>- New practical how-tos for making my Sorcerer game better<br/><br/>I can find the first 3 online, so I'd be most interested in the last one, but the format -- facing pages with annotations -- doesn't scream "handy instruction manual" to me.  So if you do think the new content makes it easier for folks to play a good game of Sorcerer, it might be worth your while to spell out <i>how</i>.<br/><br/><b>The physical books:</b><br/><br/>It's much harder for me to invest in the idea of getting a physical book without any knowledge of cost (how much will shipping be for the softcover?  how much will "at cost" be for the deluxe?).  The idea of paying now and then having to pay again later is also a major turn-off.  As a customer, I would want to see you estimate these prices and show me very clearly how paying for them will be easy.<br/><br/>(Even better would be if you included them as reward levels, but I assume you have good reasons for not doing that.)<br/><br/><b>The shot glasses:</b><br/><br/>I see no added value in you using Cafe Press (or whomever) to put generic free images on shot glasses when I could do that myself (and for less money).  Make the image Sorcerer-specific, and that's a whole different story.<br/><br/>I would recommend that you take the most iconic element from the art Thomas does for you, isolate it, reproduce it in silhouette, and put <i>that</i> on the shot glasses.  I'd bet Thomas would be happy to do that for you, actually.  Example:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://shrikedesign.com/sorcerer-denmark-demo1.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://shrikedesign.com/sorcerer-denmark-demo2.jpg"/><br/><br/>Hope this helps!

You're just opening a spigot and crossing your fingers that you won't get wet.<br/><br/>Consider this: there are a certain number of post-Forge purchasers of the <i>Sorcerer</i> book (myself included) that have never been able to get that book in PDF. For some of us (again, myself included) the PDF is all we really wanted in the first place. You might be thinking of this as "hey, I need to pay for some art". At least some portion of the public is thinking of this as "holy fucking shit, I can get <i>Sorcerer</i> on PDF now!".<br/><br/>As for the draft pitch\u2026 I've backed a couple hundred Kickstarters at this point. This one reads\u2026a little weird. But, then, so does <i>Sorcerer</i>, so that's probably not much of a detriment. I am not much of a fan of "trinket swag", so don't care about the shotglasses and such. The "if we hit a stretch goal, you get physical books for the same price" is interesting, but strange. What if I don't want the physical books? Also, lets assume everyone backs at the $25 level. Once you hit $3000 (which, seriously, will take about four hours), your labor burden suddenly goes from sending out a couple hundred e-mails with download URL to a <i>massive</i> fulfillment/shipping boondoggle, particularly if the number of backers keeps growing.<br/><br/>Also, the Fate Core kickstarter has 4,912 backers, with over a month to go. Suppose you get 25% of those backers. Do you really have 1,000 tequila recipes?<br/><br/>No comments on the video.

Confusing to say the least and very much not in the spirit of how Kickstarter works. My advice (as someone who is a kickstarter junkie) is Just set your goal at $3000 and make softbound books part of the kickstarter from the get go (of course make sure to cost this out as physical shipment is costly). With this you could have a more meaningful donation spread: $15 core book as pdf; $20 core + supplements pdf; $30 softbound core book + all pdfs. You could even do a limited 50 backer early bird special or something, like $25 for softbound core book + supplements pdf. Then use the stretch goals to create more art or additional supplements. If you really want to try and do a fancy hard bound you could make it a stretch goal and then allow people to upgrade their softbound donation level to hardbound for an extra $20 (or whatever it costs). There are a number of kickstarters that do that "upgrade to get the better version" thing. Also my advise is to ditch the app book goal as it's more complicated then useful; however, it would be nice to also have an epub version as those are easier to search.<br/><br/>Also, I'd look at the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1858774754/magicians-a-language-learning-rpg?ref=search" rel="nofollow">Magicians</a> Kickstarter which was amazingly put together. Kyle Simons did a couple interviews on how do do a successful kickstarter which I recommend as he has some really interesting and creative ideas for promotion of not just his game but cross promotion of other kickstarter games: <a href="http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/10/episode-58-kyle-simons-kickstarter.html" rel="nofollow">Mom's Basement: Kyle Simons &amp; Kickstarter</a>, <a href="http://www.geekyandgenki.com/geeky-genki-gamecast-episode-19-kyle-simons-and-the-magicians-rpg/" rel="nofollow">Geeky &amp; Genki: Kyle SImons &amp; Magicians RPG</a><br/><br/>P.S.

One is to calculate it as part of the pledge level, the other is to ask the backers to each pay a given amount on top of their pledge to account for shipping. This latter method is almost a necessity if you want to account for differing expenses in global shipping. It's also not unheard of for a project to state that shipping is simply not included in the totals, and the backers will be asked to pay for it separately later on, when it's been calculated exactly.<br/><br/>Given that one might end up doing extra payments for shipping anyway where physical products are concerned, I don't think that having physical books be a stretch goal add-on is that confusing. It just means that those who want the physical book pay their $25, plus whatever Ron states as the printing+shipping cost of the physical book. This is no more complex than having a pledge level for physical books, and then requesting extra payment for shipping. It's a bit unusual, of course, but then that seems to be the overall tone here anyway.<br/><br/>Really, the basic reason for why Ron's project seems a bit peculiar compared to ordinary Kickstarters is that there just isn't very much complexity involved here. All the pledge levels are masquerading add-ons, as the core product only comes in one flavour and everything else is non-exclusionary (that is, it makes sense for a given customer to want any combination of them). The entire thing could be expressed as a single pledge level ("$1 and up: pay at least $25 to get the PDFs") with a price list for the perks you get for larger donations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401858/#Comment_401858" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T15:47:47+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  3:47PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blinking and thinking.

I'm still going to frame it in the sense that this is a Sorcerer Kickstart, not the Sorcerer Kickstart - and hence very "this goal" oriented - but many of the recommendations are going to make this work much better. Again, I need to mull over all of it (and keep it coming if you want!), so figure about 24 hours before the preview page shows the changes.<br/><br/>JD, I apologize for my bad temper last week.<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401869/#Comment_401869" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T16:24:32+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  4:24PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2012 7:09PM by kksimons.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ron,<br/><br/>Coming at this from someone who only knows of Sorcerer and Ron Edwards by reputation alone, after listening to the video and reading the kickstarter I still have no idea what the game is or what it's about. If I were you I would make the video about Sorcerer as if you were pitching the game (as an elevator pitch, and while talking about it through up the screenshots of the pdf preview you've got up there to show people it's a thing, it's pretty, etc) and then say at the end of the video that the kickstarter is for getting it out as a better version in pdf.<br/><br/>A lot of the other stuff like the history of Sorcerer, pioneering RPG's is awesome but not really what the kickstarter is about - I'd throw it up in the introduction. Also, like others have said, don't undervalue your kickstarter! Think about some of your pledge levels as well - $150 for a consult, feedback, playtesting on a game is pretty cheap, is it something you want to limit (or make more expensive)?<br/><br/>Those reviews, actual plays, testimonials will help the project a lot - make sure you showcase them. Separate the sections with a banner graphic, even if it's simple - bold on kickstarter doesn't really stand out. The kickstarter is short, so it's not a big deal but it takes very little effort.<br/><br/>I know you want the kickstarter to be lean and mean but a little work on presentation goes a long way. If you put those images on an actual shot glass for example, have them side by side. Hotlink the WordPress and Blogspot URLs.<br/><br/>If you need help with anything put it to the community! I'm sure tons of people would be more than willing to come up with simple graphics, put the images on an actual shot class, etc. I know you want to keep it short, sweet and simple but you're already doing a kickstarter, why not take a few extra minutes to make sure it's all the more successful.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401871/#Comment_401871" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T17:17:45+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  5:17PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, throw in a pdf of S/Lay w/Me as a stretch goal and you will at least make me very happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401876/#Comment_401876" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T17:38:28+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  5:38PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/kksimons">@kksimons</a> don't undervalue your kickstarter or your time.

I don't give a shit about the cover art, but from your point of view, that's not relevant. I've plunked down $25.<br/><br/>Now, while I'm maybe willing to pay for shipping for the hard copies, I'd really rather you set up two more levels of the kickstarter, one for national shipping, one for international. First of all, that is what I'm used to from other kickstarters, and I am judging your kickstarter by the others I've supported. It's probably a safe assumption that I'm not the only one doing this. Second, I want to know how much money I'm paying. This is important for things like budgets, including budgets for other kickstarter projects and for whether I bump up my bid because you've added a cool extra. Third, I don't see how I can use Kickstarter to pay for postage in advance when I don't know what that'll be, and the thing about Kickstarter is that it makes paying <i>easy</i>. You want to make it as easy as possible for me to give you my money. (Seriously, after some disaster or other, the charity I donated to was the one that didn't make me jump through hoops. Make it easy for me to throw money at you.)<br/><br/>As for why you need extra stretch goals: Don't leave money lying on the table. Let's do a quick compare and contrast:<br/><br/>I love Jenna Moran's work, and I supported her IndieGoGo project for something like $9. All of her add ons came with that $9. I didn't need hard copy, and I had no reason to give her extra money. She didn't have a huge number of add ons, and could easily have gotten $25 out of me by adding them as things I got by pledging more. I'm not going to spend more than I have to to get what I want. There are a lot more IndieGoGo and Kickstarter projects clamoring for my wallet, and spending only $9 on hers means I can justify spending $15 on someone else's. (And that's before we get to other expenses like, oh, supporting my FLGS.)<br/><br/>Fate Core? I was panting to throw money at this. I was panting so hard I kept checking the site to see if I could do it yet, and groaning in frustration when I realized I'd miscalculated and it was a day or so early. $1 for preview of the rules. $10 for all the pdfs. $30 for hard copy of the book. This is a good set of levels -- I'm in for $30, and a friend with more of a cash flow problem is likely to find $10 because it comes with All the PDFs.<br/><br/>But, this project has gotten $20 more out of me, because, well, now there are three books worth of material. And, I get it all as PDFs, no matter what. I don't have to spend dime one more. But, for $20, I get the second book in hard copy as well as the first. Easy -- I don't have to calculate probably postage. I know what this will run me. I can pay $30 more for hard copy of the third book, and I may. It all depends on the stretch goals. And Evil Hat is very good at choosing stretch goals and pacing them. I supported the Dinocalypse novels kickstarter even though I'm not that into the concept because it got to the point where Evil Hat was offering 7 pdf novels for $25, which was just Too Much Stuff -- that doesn't take up shelf space -- for me to turn up my nose at.<br/><br/>Evil Hat is also good at crunching the numbers to make sure that offering more stuff doesn't mean the project slides from the black to the red, and that is something to be aware of, and a valid reason for going easy on the stretch goals.<br/><br/>Also, look at the Monsterhearts kickstarter. The video and the text make it very clear what the game's about. The stretch goals were well paced, right down to the final, semi-silly one that I knew probably wouldn't make it, and that was okay, given what it was.<br/><br/>Will you have a thousand backers tossing money at you far beyond your most optimistic estimate? I don't know. But, you need to be prepared for best case scenario as well as worst case. There are a couple of projects out there that I think would have gotten more money if they'd had more stretch goals. I could see the cash flow tapering off as the final stretch goal was reached and a new one was not added.<br/><br/>Now, to be fair, it may be that the folks running those projects accurately gauged what they could get folks to shell out. But, I suspect extra stretch goals would have helped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401895/#Comment_401895" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T22:59:57+00:00" title="December 27, 2012 10:59PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meg and Vincent are right.  <br/>So, for $5 I get a thank you, but no game?<br/>thank you &lt; sandwich<br/>Who is this Kickstarter for?

Part of that is because you always refused to do "dumb" PDFs (that is, electronic products which don't offer extra functionalities above the print book) but for a long time ended up selling no electronic versions at all, so that one had no choice but to get books shipped around.

Like Chris says, you can limit the number of pledgers at all tiers, or have one tier whose minimum pledge will get you the exact amount of money you want once supplies run out, or leave it open but make it clear that the only thing that happens is a fancy cover on a book they still have to buy later. Then, all The People Who Want to Shower Ron Edwards with Gold and Riches can pay for Thomas Denmark (and hey, plus whoever will do the epub etc conversions for you, if you want that too) and everybody who just wants a book can wait until it's done and just buy it normally. And you can do a second kickstarter for the fancy leather hardcover edition, yeah?<br/><br/>Just look at <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/gregstolze/created" rel="nofollow">Greg Stole's kickstarter projects</a>. He asks for X amount of money, and there's only one reward: he releases a story. When he gets funded (which is most of the time) he raises X amount, plus a wee bit more -- because once it's funded, there's no reason for people to put in more money. It looks to me like he knows how to Not Get Paid Too Much.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with fancy kickstarters full of purchase options and special toys, but (and maybe I'm reading you wrong) it kinda sounds like you'd really rather get in and get out with exactly what you want. I don't see any reason at all why you can't do that here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401912/#Comment_401912" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T06:43:56+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  6:43AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>JD, I apologize for my bad temper last week.</blockquote>\nIt's all good, happy to help.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401919/#Comment_401919" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T07:12:49+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  7:12AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2012 7:19AM by Wordman.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, do what Johnstone just said.<br/><br/>Really.<br/><br/>Your current draft is a win for consumers but, based on what you've said here, will wind up being a net loss for you (not monetarily, but effort-, labor- and stress- wise).<br/><br/>If you follow Johnstone's advice, you get what you want, consumers get\u2026 well, not exactly what they want, but exactly what is promised.

On the other hand you seem to feel obliged to fulfill the kickstarter tradition of stretch goals, big rewards, special kickstarter only offers, etc. <br/>Pick one way, doing both isn't working!<br/><br/>Here's the first way: <br/>"Hey, I'm Ron, Sorcerer PDFs are coming out in January for $x, but you can pay that same price now, upfront, to help me commission cool new art. Also a tequila recipe."<br/>You would make your goal, and have no additional commitments. That's totally cool.<br/><br/>If you want to make this a proper kickstarter, then kick it up a notch. Take the paperback off of the stretch goals, you'll reach that level crazy fast, so it's just a formality that will confuse people. The hardcover too, although that means setting a hard price for the hardcover books. Add stretch goals for other Adept Press games as PDFs (I would love me some It Was a Mutual Decision). Make the shot glasses optional- they're fun, but will annoy some people (I don't drink). I'm sure you have plenty more ideas for what to do with your company than I.<br/><br/>My point is that a Ron Edwards kickstarter could easily be HUGE.

I merely still find myself thinking entirely in the reverse of what everybody else does. To me, the goal is what I want, and the pledge rewards are what you want. Whereas apparently the KS-culture has evolved a different outlook in which the goal is what the pledgers get. I am not makin' any judgment, this is my observation and mental block, ignore as you see fit. I may have to stay with this outlook for purposes of my own sanity, and if I do, I guess I'll have to say so up-front in the presentation.<br/><br/>Johnstone, I'm with you.

It should not be a link in the footnote, it should be the first 1-2 paragraphs of you project. I assume you're looking for potential new meat into playing, not just asking only from folks who know sorcerer... With the description of Sorcerer missing, that is going to be stone-cold /baffling/ to passersby.<br/><br/>Especially as the thing starts making money, and new folks come in looking at the project. "What the F? Why is this ...thing... getting all of this money??" <br/><br/>So IMO, the most important thing would to explain to people what Sorcerer is, even simply in 3-4 sentences if not 2 paragraphs (PP1: What the game is. PP2: When it was originally released, acclaim etc).<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'd agree with others. It's your campaign! But if it was me, I'd do this:<br/><br/>* Make the PDF level be at $10 or $15<br/><br/>* As someone said, bump up the end campaign goal enough to where at least softcover/hardcover books are covered in the campaign, and make those a standard goal item at whatever price point.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402229/#Comment_402229" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T22:17:50+00:00" title="December 30, 2012 10:17PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2012 10:20PM by Ron Edwards.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So!

I think that's real good pricing. Maybe I have to make it clear that two substantial books are involved.<br/><br/>2. I finally found the (very hidden!) field for limiting specific rewards, but have not yet figured out to make links look good in the KS programming. BBC and HTML don't seem to do it. If anyone knows how, email me.<br/><br/>3. I know all about international shipping postage. It's horrible and effectively sank my previously-functional business model between 2008 and 2012. But I am conceding to what appears to be an insurmountable expectation, that if you pledge (and we reach a goal), that you get the book.<br/><br/>4. I'm simply payin' for the postage, world-wide. You pledge, and if we make the stretch goal, the books arrive - all done. (You get the PDFs too.) and that's the main reason the stretch goal is so much higher. I fully expect it to be eaten up by printing, postage, and the dungeon-load of lurking small costs.<br/><br/>Depending on how this goes, and on other stuff, I'll reserve possible Kickstart plans for the fancier versions later. It may be that ordinary business will make those possible without it anyway, which was the original plan.<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402271/#Comment_402271" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-31T11:36:07+00:00" title="December 31, 2012 11:36AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ron: You'll want to make the international shipping concerns in the KS project itself (either right away; or when it goes live, you can add an FAQ at the bottom) because you'll get asked that over and over.<br/><br/>Yeah, for links you have to use Kickstarter's "highlight a word, add a URL" thing.

I want to support this kickstarter and help get some great art on these books, but: I really want hard copies, and if the KS doesn't reach the stretch goal, then I'll have to buy hard copies after the fact.  Will I end up paying twice, or could I subtract the $25 KS-PDF expenditure from the cost of a future order of hard copies?  Rhetorical questions.<br/><br/>Simplest, I think, if there's an option to buy into the KS for $XX to receive PDFs + hard copies.  <br/>(further, if there's an "international shipping" version of that option, I'd pick that)<br/><br/>Otherwise, I might just keep out of the KS and wait til the hard copies become available to order.  And that would be unfortunate.<br/><br/>My $0.02.  Either way, looking forward to reading these.

You have to count on hitting that $10,000. Even if you don't think it's realistic, once this goes live if you've committed to it you have to plan for what happens if you hit that number.<br/><br/>Because it is then going to be a big deal and you're going to be packing 300 or 500 or 1000 parcels (www.uline.com is your friend) which will take days and days to do. If you do that, especially when you didn't plan or want such a big deal, without leaving anything for yourself (or worse yet running a deficit - you have a lot of international fans, and you can't skimp on padding), it's not going to feel very good.<br/><br/>It's already going to be a great responsibility delivering everything you take money for (even if it is just PDFs), don't make it a great burden too.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402360/#Comment_402360" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T11:12:30+00:00" title="January  1, 2013 11:12AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jim,<br/><br/>I hear you! I woke up this morning thinking, "What have I done?" and it had nothing to do with New Year's celebrating. <br/><br/>Structuring it is tricky, though. Since shipping isn't an issue unless we make the stretch goal, I don't want to make international customers pay for shipping for something they might not get. Maybe I should shrug and say "too bad."<br/><br/>Doing the code for it is confusing me too. For example, I'm backing this project: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/601893462/ehdrigohr-the-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/601893462/ehdrigohr-the-roleplaying-game</a>. If you check out the $25 pledge level, there's a little line at the bottom adding $10 for international shipping. I think that's the solution, or part of it, but I have no idea how to add that.<br/><br/>Everyone, thanks for the links formatting info. <br/><br/>So you know: I plan to go live with this quite soon.<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Julie" title="Julie"><img alt="Julie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Julie">Julie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402375/#Comment_402375" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T13:14:37+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  1:14PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instructions for adding that international shipping line are here: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creator%20questions#HowDoICharShipOnMyRewa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creator questions#HowDoICharShipOnMyRewa</a><br/><br/>I'm not sure how exactly that works, but I suspect that it does not add an extra amount to your goal, i.e., it wouldn't be $10,000 plus x amount of extra devoted to shipping, instead international pledgers would be charged more for their pledge. I think that would be a problem if you do not reach $10,000 because those pledgers would be charged shipping even if no physical item is shipped. I have not found an example where the initial pledge is for a non-shippable item that then changes to a shippable item at a later date.<br/><br/>Julie                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402385/#Comment_402385" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T14:18:03+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  2:18PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, I'm pretty sure that the extra shipping thing is just a free instruction in the text, not an enforced rule. This means that Ron can just instruct people to not pay any shipping costs until the stretch goal is reached, at which point everybody can add that to their pledge. Were it me, I'd even phrase it such that getting your complimentary paper copy of the book depends on you paying the postage, clearly and unequivocally. (That is, it's not "it would be nice if you paid a bit extra to cover postage", but rather "you can get the book on paper by pledging $X extra, so as to cover my postage expenses". ) This way there'd be no griping afterwards if somebody decides they don't want to pay more, or whatever.<br/><br/>(The recent Glorantha book Kickstarter did all this, basically, and it didn't seem that complex to me. At one point they decided to split the book they were selling into two volumes, which meant that the shipping expenses for American customers increased by $5 each, while those for international customers didn't. They just told everybody to add that amount to their pledges to cover the shipping. I presume that if you don't pay the instructed amount, they wouldn't ship your book; a sketchy thing to do when you've already sold the book itself, but I guess the implication in this kind of crowdfunding structure is that the customer is responsible for the shipping expense, even if it changes as the project evolves. After all, you could just withdraw your backing if the project changes in a bad way in the middle.)<br/><br/>In other words, Ron: add that postage information in there ($X for Americans, $Y internationally, or whatever), but also advice the backers to not mind that to begin with. Then later you might get to declare that oh thousand jubilations, we managed the stretch goal, so everybody remember to add that postage expense to your pledges. Remember that you can change your pledge amounts in Kickstarter at any point, so it's no problem for the backers to add the postage later, as long as they're following the proceedings enough to notice the request.<br/><br/>As far as I know the shipping costs are calculated as part of the total collected; I've never heard of Kickstarter supporting a "side fund" where you could put part of the contributions aside and not have them count as part of the collected total.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402394/#Comment_402394" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T15:10:59+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  3:10PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, don't eat the shipping costs.

Also, shipping costs do count towards your goal as all dollars pledged in the kickstarter contribute to your goal. <br/><br/>I'd just keep the tiers as digital myself, assuming you won't hit 10k (though I'm sure you will) to keep it simple in the beginning. Just be sure to say in that once 10k is hit, you're eligible for a printed copy if you add X amount of dollars to cover shipping costs.<br/><br/>I would just come up with a set number for domestic and international shipping in the vein of "once we hit 10k, if you are based internationally pledge an extra X dollars, if you are in the U.S. pledge an extra X dollars".

The PDF for Trollbabe is already on sale, and I want similar PDFs for all the other games available. The layout guy will trudge his way through'em after the Sorcerer work is done, beginning with the most urgent, the layout for Shahida's release in English as both book and PDF. After that, it should be pretty easy to get all the others into shape. I don't expect to do anything different for the content of any of them, no new covers or anything like that; the only exception is the addition of a play-example for S/Lay w/Me.<br/><br/>Truth is, I'd prefer if most of my commerce concerned the PDFs in the future. Shipping costs are <i>horrible</i>, among other things. I'll still keep some hard copies available for sale on-line, though.<br/><br/>As for other Kickstarts, geez, I don't know. I see it as something I'd really like to reserve for special events, and necessary ones. Some of the possibilities include (i) deluxe editions of one or more of my titles, (ii) some special event or important push for the Story Now series (Spione, Shahida, and a related work I've just begun), (iii) production of the three religion games together in a fancy form, or (iv) helping with another person's work that's related to mine, such as a Sorcerer film or anything of that sort. But for the most part, ordinary game play, design, and production are well within my means using ordinary sales profits, without need for crowdfunding. <br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402649/#Comment_402649" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T00:05:20+00:00" title="January  4, 2013 12:05AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally missed that the Trollbabe PDF was on sale again!

But due to my fumbling my way through the various Kickstart features, I didn't manage the finances of the switch to fulfillment very well. I totally had it covered, conceptually, but Kickstart can do things I didn't know about yet, so didn't utilize effectively, and some of my attempted restructuring messed up what was there (the duplicate $25 pledge is an unfixable artifact, for instance). <br/><br/>What to plan for is a bit murky. Kicktraq is fun to look at, but I am not treating it as authoritative. The KS Dashboard shows me where people come from, electronically speaking, and it's <i>incredibly</i> diverse, which is good, but again, I don't have a good way to know when the limits of the possible sources will be hit; shoot, as it stands at this moment, half of the ways people get to the page, I never even heard of. New pledges do seem to be steadily arriving, though. I'm tentatively optimistic that my fumbles will be compensated; as I said in the Update, every one does help.<br/><br/>Anyway, keep an eye out today for one or more new $50 tiers with some opportunities or possibilities of interest.<br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402903/#Comment_402903" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T08:14:58+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  8:14AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Yep...

In other words, it shows you how much money you would make by the end of your project if the speed of acquisition remained constant from now until the end of the project. There's no secret knowledge or complex prediction going on in there. Saying that the total is "currently trending towards" some high value is technically quite accurate, but a layman will then come in and think that this is some sort of prediction when it's not. I don't quite know why the trend is pushed as an indicator in Kicktraq, except that it's easy to compute and it gives you nice headlines when you can scream about how this or that project is currently trending towards 10 billion dollars.<br/><br/>The "projection" feature, on the other hand, attempts to do some more complex prediction about where a project is going to end up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402918/#Comment_402918" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T12:29:46+00:00" title="January  7, 2013 12:29PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If one looks at the Projection, one gets "Insufficient Data"; if one looks at the Trend, one gets a linear approximation (per Eero).

This project is doing something interesting. At first, after the first goal and on the way to the stretch goal, it looked S shaped, as if it was approaching a leveling off. However, now - and notice that it includes after the stretch goal - apparently the increase has been frightening linear and rather steep (just about 45 degrees) since 12 AM which started January 4 (it was curved positive a bit prior to that). The dashboard also provides data on how people come to the site, and the origins become more and more diverse as time goes on - apparently the news is spreading from venue to venue, and with each step, newcomers arrive and pledge. Which is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>As Rob mentioned as well, continued activity from the previous venues appears to be involved, which means people probably arrive from a given venue, then go back to it and talk about the Kickstart there some more.<br/><br/>I think there is absolutely no way to tell how this is going to go. It could level off at any minute, it could start a new shape, or whatever. My hope is that the current trend will occur for some time, obviously; and also that certain modifications at the approximate halfway point (in terms of days) will generate continued interest.<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402941/#Comment_402941" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T16:05:44+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  4:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The interesting thing is -- as evidenced from the past -- many KS projects only really get going once they are already successful.

about upgrading my pledge, I'm getting that "this-will-finally-explain-everything" vibe that I also got with the old Mage: the Ascension line. I appreciate the endless explanation of the explanation of the game, but I'm not sure how much I'm willing to pay for it. As I've been trying to spread the good word (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1644wf/all_the_sorcerer_books_for_25_bucks_ron_edwards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1644wf/all_the_sorcerer_books_for_25_bucks_ron_edwards/</a>), I suspect that people may think it's strange to be pledging to get a good explanation on why they should be pledging. Maybe this kickstarter is really just for us who already know about the game or even own the original books already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403002/#Comment_403002" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T06:40:12+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  6:40AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ricardo,<br/><br/>I appreciate the thought, but I hope you can see that it puts me in an impossible situation. Either I help with explanations and people say, "Oh, so you have to <i>explain </i>it," or I don't, and they wail, "But you aren't <i>helping</i>!" I guess I have to choose which way to be damned.<br/><br/>However, I really think the Kickstart is fairer than the vibe you're referencing. I don't think that offering interaction, examples, and community conversations about an innovative game is the same, which is to say, offering less-than-good content and continually promising to make it good.<br/><br/>Because it was and is innovative, Sorcerer in text is hard for many to grasp no matter how straightforward the text could be. It's evidently the case that a lot of readers have trouble with it, but then with only a little bit of conversational focus, discover that, "Oh wow, it says what you're saying, right here!" <br/><br/>I'm offering a variety of means to heighten that focus, across a lot of people at once, and a person can participate in that at what strikes me as a very reasonable cost. I'm not even requiring full price for each of them, because they stack for $10 after the first $50, and the books come along with the deal too. And if you just want the books with the new covers, then you don't need to pledge for those options at all.<br/><br/>Your final point is valid. I like the phrase I hit upon earlier in the thread: "a" Sorcerer Kickstart, not "the" Sorcerer Kickstart. It's not actually a recruitment drive, it's a fundraiser, in-and-out. It blew up on me a little when I shifted to book fulfillment, and fumbling the pledge rewards interface causes me some problems (learning as I go ...), but the basic philosophy is still the same - yes, mainly targeting the people who do know and want to enhance their enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>I appreciate your candor, and I don't want this to be a defensive post. I hope instead that it's a chance to let you see where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17752/sorcerer-upgrade-kickstart-preview-and-critique/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17752/sorcerer-upgrade-kickstart-preview-and-critique">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17752/sorcerer-upgrade-kickstart-preview-and-critique/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17752/sorcerer-upgrade-kickstart-preview-and-critique/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17752%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17752%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
