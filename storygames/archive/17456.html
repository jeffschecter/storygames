Fight with the weapons gifted to you by Nature, exploit the scenery to your advantage, shape the wood with magic, turn the tide of battle with your animal powers, destroy the Excavators and save the Great Wood!<br/><br/>The game is made for a maximum of 5 players, one of which (we call them "Storyteller") plays the Great Wood and the rest of its inhabitants. In this ARPG, it's the players who set the difficulties of their characters' missions and the amount of resources the Storyteller has to oppose them.</blockquote>\nIt is the first IndieGoGo campaign for an Italian role-playing game I\u2019ve ever known. <i>Forest Keeper</i> has been already released in Italian, and now the authors want to translate it in English.

I'm Giovanni Micolucci author of FK, this is the Italian version of the manual (Print On Demand edition):<br/><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cGhMhDRFxLM/UIvngRn89-I/AAAAAAAADKA/mvv3AROPYJM/s1600/318738_10151222266162103_167948841_n.jpg"/><br/><br/>I lets explain something more about the game itself: <br/>it's what we call an Action Roleplaying Game (ARPG), in which you play the last, furry heroes of the Great Wood, in their struggle against the Wicked Fire the "Eagle-Owl, the Rat and the Marmot".<br/><br/>You'll fight with weapons gifted to you by Nature, exploit the scenery to your advantage, shape the wood with a freeform magic, unleash your animal powers, beat the corrupted animals servants of the Wicked Fire, destroy the human<br/>Excavators... and save the Great Wood!<br/><br/>The game is made for a maximum of five players, one of which we'll call "Storyteller" (Evil Fire...). He plays the Great Wood and the rest of its inhabitants, friends or foes. <br/><br/>At the base level, the system works the following way: <br/>To do something you roll two six-sided dices, add the results together and check if the sum is equal or less than the value of the appropriate Domain: there are three, Physical, Mental or Exploration. The higher your character's skills, the more<br/>chances he has to succeed; during the game, the characters grow by accumulating forest power points, which make them stronger and more effective.<br/><br/>Roleplaying your character in Forest Keeper will be fundamental: if you don't, you'll give away precious bonuses to your opponents. The system makes all this advancements happen in real time, during sessions and even during fights.<br/>In Forest Keeper, in fact, will be on the players to decide the mission's difficulty and whether or not your buddies are playing their characters in an interesting and compelling way! <br/><br/>By choosing the amount of points you want to obtain on a successful mission, you give more or less power to the opposition in the hands of the Storyteller. He frames the scenes and narrates the setting, but has limited<br/>resources to build NPCs and hinder the animals' efforts.<br/><br/>Well, I think I highlighted the main features of Forest Keeper and of what playing it will be.<br/><br/><b>With Forest Keeper, you're supporting a group of friends making stuff other groups of friends would like, as this one and many more other games to follow... but at the same time, must say, you're helping carrying a message of care and respect<br/>for Nature, presenting itself as more and more important \u2013 still often ignored \u2013 nowadays.</b><br/><br/>"So guys, best regards from the the Eagle-Owl, the Rat and the Marmot, from the<br/>whole Great Wood... And of course from the Vas Quas Team!" (Cit. Matteo Mariani XD XD XD "Watch indiegogo video")<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/>P.s.

Together, we choose as the Mission\u2019s stake 4 Wood Power Points (Easy challenge).<br/><br/>Time is a hard master, so we decide to get immediately into the action of the combat scene (main guideline of the game, in fact)!<br/><br/>The Storyteller describes then (as a rule) the combat scenery: a wood of gnarled beech trees, a carpet of fallen leaves and colored mushrooms.<br/><br/>Here, in the mud below the leaves, wait the first three opponents, corrupted by the Wicked Fire and now his minions: the Warrior frogs Cra, Cri and Cro!<br/><br/>So, the turn order is set easily by the Initiative of each character: 1\xb0 Cra, 2\xb0 Jeronimo, 3\xb0 Cri, 4\xb0 Cro, 5\xb0 Gabrielle, 6\xb0 DDR.<br/><br/>A short explanation of the interpretation rules that concerns the combat scenes makes all the players aware of the possibilities and of the risks of a fight in FK: in short, compelling and original descriptions give you an actual bonus, while boring and obvious ones makes harder for you to beat even a weaker opponent. And then the combat begin, proving itself as very animated!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GNTsIdQiSt4/UE9Saudm_pI/AAAAAAAAC9Y/FyahlkvH_Js/s1600/Forest_Keeper_Scena3.jpg"/><br/><br/>Cra the frog attacks fist, jumping and trying to coil her tongue around the Owl Jeronimo\u2019s throat. Jeronimo\u2019s defense consists in trying a jump backwards and then spreading its wings to fly. The frog is successful though, and Jeronimo is now thrown on the ground with his neck plucked and in pain (his Animal Power Bar goes up to 1). Cra the frog thus finishes her turn for Jeronimo, who now concentrates, leaving the pain behind. He summons then the mighty Wood spirit, channeling it by the branches of a near, huge and old beech. The leaves trembles and the wood screeches, while Cra the frog tries desperately to counterattack Jeronimo by throwing herself on him while he casts. But the Owl\u2019s magic is too strong: the wind blows stronger, a storm of fallen leaves covers the scene, a loud crash\u2026 and when it has calmed down Cra the frog lies crushed by a branch of the old beech.<br/><br/>Because of the good description of this scene, Jeronimo gets 4 Interpretation Power Points: he could choose of having then converted in Wood Power Points, but he prefers to store them to use them as direct Bonuses during next attacks. Meanwhile his Animal Power Bar grows to 2, making his Special Attack available already during the following turn.<br/><br/>Jeronimo then declares his turn finished. So, it\u2019s supposed to be Cri and Cro\u2019s turn, the Storyteller\u2019s two other frogs, but he decides to wait and turn for the next player: by making this, the Storyteller avoids being counterattacked by Gabrielle and DDR together; those two in fact, being contiguous in the turn order, would be able to do it.<br/><br/>Gabrielle the Marmot then throws herself against Cri the frog, performing a powerful attack with his pinecone mace. The frog tries to dodge by a spectacular jump which would have put her behind the Marmot\u2019s back, but Gabrielle hits effectively the frog and causing her a wound.<br/><br/>Then Gabrielle turns for DDR the Rat, who asks for a combined attack with the Marmot: so the two forest keepers synchronize an attack against Cro the frog, the one still unharmed. DDR uses his RAM bank as a blade to hit undercut the frog, while Gabrielle \u2013 beautifully describing the scene by linking it to her previous action \u2013 supports the attack by keeping her mace rotating and aiming at Cro. Cri, the wounded frog, tries to defend the latter by pushing her away, but the keepers prevail: Cri finds herself interposing her body before the original target and gets both the attack, being slashed by DDR\u2019s RAM and finished by the rotating pinecone.<br/><br/>Thus, Gabrielle gains an Interpretation Point which chooses to convert in Wood Power Points: by doing this, she decides to upgrade his attack\u2019s aiming \u2013 and she justifies it by describing the discovery of the new attack she just performed. Meanwhile, the Animal Power of both Gabrielle and DDR grows at 1.<br/><br/>The demonstration stopped here. In fact the Storyteller, left with just Cro the frog alone, in a real game would have tried to make her flee the battlefield, in order to preserve his precious \u2013 \u2018cause limited \u2013 forces to oppose the forest keepers\u2019 progresses.<br/>The party got 3 Wood Power Points, with Jeronimo the Owl having 1 more WPPoint for not using his Animal Power. By making this, he could have chosen as well something useful for the story: for example, finding the key of the transformer box and thus making its destruction easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395394/#Comment_395394" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T10:31:43+00:00" title="October 30, 2012 10:31AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks beautiful.

I am myself one of those people who love and use this tools and possibilities to make the printing of Forest Keeper and its distribution possible. Still, for this project we made an offbeat choice.<br/><br/>So we requested for some \u201cline art\u201d drawings, made in pencil in a first moment and then Indian inked. Since the beginning we thought of a \u201cfable-ish\u201d connotation for our game and its manual. As you can see from the illustrations already shared, we can proudly say that this set of ideas has been made real thanks to our brilliant illustrator, <a href="http://francescabaerald.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">Francesca Baelard (on deviantART click).</a><br/><br/>Her great work was all about this: the drawings are somewhat classic but original, they mix perfectly drama and irony, and hides small touches of class which will be remarked only by the sharpest looks.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lZD12y9SLwQ/UE3tVbRSUaI/AAAAAAAAC8I/z8LtoSb6GLE/s1600/francesca_baerald_forest_keeper.jpg"/><br/><br/>I\u2019d like to remember as well that only who actually worked with Indian ink knows how much focusing it requires, and the risk of having an entire drawing thrown away because of one small mistake. And we do think we can find all this craft and this care in our Forest Keeper\u2019s scenes and illustrations!<br/><br/>One of my favourite is indeed the one representing the speech of the Rat King Cacarat, which I'd like to share in the original version, not yet inked. For the keenest eyes, you could be able to spot a difference with the official version (which you can find on these pages).<br/> <br/><br/><b>So, please help us defending the Great Wood from spilled ink on already finished drawings! </b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/forestkeeper?a=230223" rel="nofollow">Share this news and, if you want to support our campaign on Forest Keeper!</a>,<br/>Giovanni Micolucci (vasquas!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395568/#Comment_395568" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T09:13:52+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  9:13AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on vacation with my family and there is no internet connection I think in this place.

Whenever a fight is starting, the Storyteller describes the scenery, as a rule. The player can then uses magic to control at his own will the elements of which the scenery itself is made.<br/><br/>Here follows the translation of a recent AP, played a couple of weeks ago:<br/><br/><i>"Alexio the Owl casts a first spell - an pretty awesome one! : he narrates that, by moving his wings, he creates a whirlwind that takes the thousand fallen leaves on the ground and then hurls them as blades towards the enemy Goldfinch. As defense, the latter uses magic as well, using the sunlight to blind the Owl.<br/>The try ends up with a 0 Bonus, and then with the Goldfinch success in defense (with a 0 Bonus the defendant is always the winner). This gets narrated by describing as the blades fail to hit their target because Alexio gets blinded by a strong flash of sunlight. "</i><br/><br/>In FK, in fact, you can actually narrate everything you want to happen, and the system only governs and exactly tells how much damage you deal or what practical effects you can obtain. <br/>Forest Keeper is really a game of interpretation, there are no things like slots for moving, or bonds such as these. On top of that, in this game Interpretation Points/Bonuses are given as a reward mostly by other players, who liked the scene you have narrated.<br/><br/><br/>I hope all is a bit clearer to anyone interested, but don't hesitate to ask for more.<br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/><br/>Matteo Mariani                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395830/#Comment_395830" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T01:28:11+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  1:28AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thx Matteo! <br/><br/>Friends of Great Wood help us to promote our campaign on IndieGoGo, we need all your support to be able to reach the goal!

We are putting all our enthusiasm in this project and we hope to send it to you.<br/><br/>We are only a group of friend love RPG and we would like to achieve this goal and we accept for this, all your suggestions and ideas to promote our dream!<br/><br/>Enjoy the great illusion!<br/>Giovanni Micolucci                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396405/#Comment_396405" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T12:25:55+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 12:25PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For friends supporters, what do you want to know about forest keeper? <br/><br/>ASAP we will try to translate a new Actual Play and maybe the three races to complete the setting. <br/><br/>But if you have specific questions, do not hesitate to ask!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396535/#Comment_396535" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T00:53:58+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 12:53AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 1:17AM by vasquas.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys send questions directly to the forum, <b>so that everyone can participate!</b><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Many Supporter have asked me if forest keeper is for one shot or long campaign.

You can also make one shot, the game is completely configurable!<br/><br/><b>The game is suitable for players from 13 years old to 99!</b> I saw people of all ages to play, being a skeleton setting, the group chooses the seriousness of adventure or style of play. My group (30 year) plays: splatter and ironic! With a group we played dramatic. In a demo a few weeks ago we played in comic style! <br/><br/><b>The game is tactical</b>, but there are no boxes, very reminiscent of a video game and the best thing is that impossible that a fight

I am getting better manual Forest Keeper, explaining some of the details better, even if I have to work at night (slumber AOAM), but I'm having fun!!!!<br/><br/>Now the game is even more "consistent"!

Thus the Rat race began to promise a better life to the other races of the Great Wood, a life in which humans would have taken good care of them and their necessities: no more shortage or struggle for food, no more fear of the predator races. But this alliance began to show its rifts pretty soon. Animals were kept in huge zoos, where life wasn\u2019t easy at all, stuck between overpopulation and the human plans for their captives: work, shows, tests\u2026 and more and more often extermination or direct slavery to the Wicked Fire\u2019s schemes. So the Rats realized that the world that they were helping to shape wouldn\u2019t have been suitable for them either, that a life eating human\u2019s waste couldn\u2019t go on forever. Thus they went back and bowed their heads to the Great Wood\u2019s might, making amend by dedicating their most valorous brothers to the war against the Wicked Fire.<br/><br/>By now, even if Marmots and especially Owls don\u2019t look upon them kindly, there are no more doubts to their willingness to fight for the deliverance of the world woods, making the once scattered forces of the free Rats united to save Nature from the Wicked Fire\u2019 hegemony .<br/><br/>The hate between Rats and Owls, running from time immemorial \u2013 mostly because of the food chain, not to speak of the more recent Owl\u2019s prejudices \u2013 has long been a hurdle to those two races collaboration. Still, in more recent times the war has make those rivals closer and closer, letting them find out the advantages of mutual help and trust. Rats began studying Owls, but then the thing continued with Rats studying together with Owls, to understand the ability of this race to alter and manipulate the power of Nature. Nowadays, Rats manage this art almost as much as their ancient rivals.<br/><br/>Rats are, in fact, the most versatile race, adapting themselves to all environments and situations. To join the Rats host means to discern well when it\u2019ll be fit to use the magic of the Wood, when to fight with roughest methods. The two main families are the Forest Rats and the Urban Rats: the latters are more skilled in combat, whilst their Forest cousins are closer to the magic of the Great Wood.<br/><br/>So\u2026 if you\u2019d like to join the Rats and the other Forest Keepers of the Great Wood, please help us spread our campaign and support: <br/><a href="http://indiegogo.com/forstkeeper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indiegogo.com/forstkeeper</a><br/><br/>Thanks to you all, from the Great Wood!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20W" title="Simon W"><img alt="Simon W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20W">Simon W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396851/#Comment_396851" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-08T10:49:56+00:00" title="November  8, 2012 10:49AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a fan of "animal games" (I have <b>Tales from The Wood</b>, <b>It's a Dog's Life</b> and<b> Woodland Warriors</b> (the latter with 3 supplements, <i>Out West</i>, <i>At Sea</i> and <i>Greyrock Isle</i>)), I have to say this sounds awesome.

Wov). The Fights are narrated (and there are no boxes). Forest Keeper doesn't contemplate animal Cities and Town. By the way, the setting is pretty odd: you should consider that the Wicked Fire has enslaved most of the animals, so the free races cooperate and live together. These free animals have been somehow "enhanced" by the power of the Great Wood. If the technology is more or less the one we have nowadays, the animals can't actually use it: like, if they find a wrench(or cellular phone) the most they can get out of it is smashing a foe's head.  <br/><br/>^_^<br/><br/> We'll translate the Owl race ASAP, and you'll probably understand a bit more how living together could be a tough business among the free races<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397098/#Comment_397098" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T12:51:08+00:00" title="November 11, 2012 12:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2012 11:25PM by vasquas.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            17 day left!

They fought hard since the beginning, trying to make the animals understand that humans were too much corrupted by the Wicked Fire's desires and that according to these no Nature was to be spared in the whole planet, at last.<br/><br/>But Rats and the other animals subdued to the Wicked Fire told a really different, more beguiling story: controlled spaces in peace, no more struggle for food, no more predators to be feared... so very soon this hopeful version was spread and believed extensively among the animal world.<br/><br/>So the Eagle-Owls became to be treated like scaremongers, chased away or killed in battle, while many of the captives had their minds controlled by the Wicked Fire.<br/><br/>This hopeless situation lasted until the Marmots, who were thought to be in alliance with the Wicked Fire, started the rebellion, united and joined the Owls in this neverending battle for the deliverance of Nature.<br/><br/>To choose to join the Eagle-Owls Race means to accept that the power of Nature represents the strongest of all weapons. By the way, as natural hunters, the Owls can prove fierce opponents also in pshycal comabat.<br/><a href="http://indiegogo.com/forestkeeper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indiegogo.com/forestkeeper</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397360/#Comment_397360" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T12:57:04+00:00" title="November 13, 2012 12:57PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2012 12:59PM by vasquas.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            15 days to save the project! <br/><br/>Why you have to fund Forest Keeper?<br/>&gt; if you love eniveromental theme and fantasy furry<br/>&gt; Forest Keeper was made by a group of friend, work togheter all day to realize our project, we work togheter only for passion and your fund make possibile this project<br/>&gt; finance Forest Keeper, help our group Vas Quas to develop other games (we distribuite free copy of our game to associations and much more)<br/>&gt; finance Forest Keeper and you get a game to entertain you and your friend for a loth of month (only 10$, 110 A5 page manual and a lit of fun!)<br/> <br/>&gt; Finance Forest Keeper make our dream possible! &lt;<br/><br/>Thank you                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397570/#Comment_397570" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T03:29:02+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  3:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here\u2019s the feedback that I got (in italy):<br/>Forest Keeper is a game of exploration and combat, no doubt about that! The most appreciated feature is the way framing works; it was described as elegant and fluid, preventing awkward moments of \u201cwhat do we do now?\u201d. The action keeps going and going without pause. The game is competitive: it\u2019s the players versus the Storyteller. The latter has no difficulty in handling scenes and doesn\u2019t need to care about game balance (the game balances itself), meaning that she can concentrate on playing as if she was just another player.<br/><br/>About the setup: The game requires some preparation, even if characters can be made really quickly (five minutes or so). Beyond the very simple basic mechanics and the \u201ctactical\u201d part, the game is fluid. Nobody complained about strategic planning slowing the game down; in fact, they said it brings some elements of positive metagame into each session.<br/><br/>Sitting in the Storyteller\u2019s seat: A thing that everyone liked was the fact that the Storyteller just sits down, waits for the group to decide the stakes of the adventures and then provides a kicker. The adventure is born and develops during the game itself. \u201cRailroading\u201d is impossible. The only complaint we got is that it\u2019s easy to run out of premade NPCS (of course, creating new ones is a trivial task).<br/><br/>On the group\u2019s side: Forest Keeper has a fanmail-like mechanism that encourages involvement and positive behavior. The more the game progresses, the more it feels spontaneous to put this mechanism to use. The mechanics push towards player involvement into the process of creating fiction. This prevents a dry, fully tactical approach to make the game dull.<br/><br/>There are lots of \u201cI\u201d in a team: A most appreciated thing was the fact that characters constantly evolve, even during conflicts, and that this evolution can turn the tide of a battle. The Storyteller can \u201cretreat\u201d not to lose precious NPCs. Two features that received lots of praise were Animal Power and the fact that the prize of victory is linked to the opposition\u2019s strength.<br/><br/>Are we done yet?: The game gives its best in medium-length/long campaigns. The existence of an endgame mechanic was much appreciated. Some people, after a successful campaigned, started new, more \u201cdifficult\u201d ones.<br/><br/>13 Days left! <br/><a href="http://indiegogo.com/forestkeeper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indiegogo.com/forestkeeper</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397814/#Comment_397814" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T03:13:45+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  3:13AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Desktop Wallpaper preview (it's also the cover of the game, india ink and wathercolor)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Cs3vSZGdOEs/UKdu0gPF9kI/AAAAAAAADSY/ilnX9_yBWbY/s1600/CoverColori_FK_NoLogo.jpg"/><br/><br/>This is a brief description of the game plays (mechanic): <br/>Forest Keeper founds its gaming, basically, on a party fighting against the Wicked Fire/Storyteller, trying to free the Great Wood (the Nature itself, in the end). In this task, you can win as well as lose, so it is a competitive game indeed.<br/><br/>At each campaign's beginning it's on the party to decide how many forests are to be freed. Each one could take one adventure or more. In fact the point is reaching, or not, the goal the Wicked Fire sets: by doing this the Great Wood's forces could be rewarded with the Power Points put up as a prize; otherwise, if the WIcked Fire's the winner, it's him getting these points for his minions.<br/>If the Great Wood's forces collect more points than their opponent in two adventures, then that wood has been liberated. On the contrary, if it's the Wicked Fire having more points, then that wood has been lost for the party (which of course could means losing the whole campaign too if the number of woods set was just one).<br/><br/>So it's on the party itself to decide how many points are to be put as a prize for reaching the objective that the Storyteller will then set. Thus, if for instance the party wants to have a prize of 4 Points for successfully completing the adventure, then the Wicked Fire will have an equivalent power in resources to deploy in order to oppose the party. So this prize decided at the start will also have the function of balancing the game from then on, translating itself in an amount of opponents adequate to the party's choices.<br/><br/>At this point, the Storyteller narrates the first elements of the scenery where the adventure will develop (for instance: "the forest is a Maple wood"), then the players add on their own account other details to it (for instance: "there's a lake among the trees"; "a stream cuts the wood in two"...).<br/><br/>Then the Storyteller sets and narrates the objective of the current adventure: for instance "The Wicked Fire had the Rat king Caracat kidnapped by Chuck the corrupted beaver. He hides him in its barrage-home. You have to try to rescue the king!"<br/><br/>From now on, the players are totally free to narrate how they'll try to reach the barrage and free Caracat.<br/><br/>FK uses the Task Resolution, so the characters act by using three main domains: "Guardian" (all the actions concerning observation, exploration, reflexes); "Spirit" (all the actions related to mind, plus the magic); "Beast" (all the physical and combat actions).<br/>The game exploit the Framing method, the Storyteller has limited resources and balanced with the party's choices: thus the game results very concentrated, straightforward, bringing all the players right into the action, avoiding some useless scenes and maintaining a fast pace from the beginning to the end of the adventure.<br/><br/>In fact, a fight or some difficulties will oppose the party progresses right then. For instance: a landslide, a fallen tree, a flood... In order to create that, the Storyteller has to use his Fire's Will Points, defining a check with a certain threshold to reach (for instance: to give a Threshold of 3 he consumes X Points... this makes the Framing pretty strong). Then each player has to choose what domain he will use in order to defend himself from the danger coming: for instance, Giovanni uses his Marmot's "Beast" to dodge the landslide; lets say its value is 12, he throws 2 six-faced dices, adds the results together (ex. 7) and deducts that from his "Beast" value: so 12 - 7 = 5 ; the threshold was 3, so the check succeeds with a Bonus of 2.<br/>But the most important thing, before throwing the dices, is the interpretation of each action: in fact, an automatic -3 will be added to the check if the player (or the Storyteller) forgets to narrate the action, especially by linking it to the previous actions and elements already introduced in the "telling" of the scene (ex: the landslide). Thus the player is motivated, and he is even more because a good interpretation could reward him with Interpretation Points given by other players who like what is being narrated - regardless if the action is a success or a failure. These points are used to get stronger, even in real-time during a fight, or to get special bonuses from the environment of the action you're narrating.<br/><br/>So, if a fight ignites, the Storyteller has to describe the environment as a rule: ex. "the maple wood is all around you, a carpet of fallen leaves covers the ground and two huge toads waits for you in the mud".<br/>The fight will be extremely and easily balanced: basically, the "Guardian" values of the opponents added have to be, at most, equal to that of the party + Prize points : ex. Guardian values added (45) + Prize choiced (4) = foes' Guardian values added (49).<br/>The game doesn't have squares or suchlike, stil the combat could be pretty tactical. But the main goal is to narrate nice and original scenes, and make your character more powerful thanks to the points your friends will give you for you compelling interpretation.<br/><br/>In FK characters won't die actually, just exit the current scene and get back in the next. The Great Wood will lose 1 stored Power Point though.<br/><br/>Combat will be fought with physical weapons which are purely descriptive, or with a free form Magic system: there are just some narrative bindings, but then it's completely up to each player to invent how the blow or the spell will be, and its effects in case of success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397942/#Comment_397942" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T03:14:46+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  3:14AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            10 days left to Save The Wood: New Upgrade Perk and Forest Spirt Perk avaible! <br/>Forest Upgrade: 10 $ <br/>PDF with 36 new animals to be released by the hegemony of Wicked Fire (which add to the base 18 in the manual) and one game scenario. if we can go over 1200$, you\u2019ll also receive \u201cUnder the sea: Save the reef!\u201d, three new \u201cfish\u201d race to impersonate and 18 between fish and shellfish to deal with!<br/><br/>Forest Spirit: 40 $<br/>Forest Keeper wallpaper, the game\u2019s manual in PDF format, a print copy of the manual, and your name in the credits (delivery not included) and one game scenario!

It was just in the beginning that Indiegogo didn't give the money back.<br/><br/>And Kickstarter is only for those with an American bank account, or did you have any other crowd funding site in mind?
