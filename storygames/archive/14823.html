Are you my grandpa?"<br/><br/>And then, as if appearing out of thin air, there she was. Sadie. So small, so weak, so cute, so innocent... She placed her tiny white hand over grandpa's knee, and it was as if all his anger started melting away.

It was a fine layout, as we had all become accostomed to from grandma. Pots and jars of pickles and jellies, smoked fish and fresh doughy bread. We all forgot whatever we had been bickering over and settled down in our seats. It was like magic.<br/><br/>You always felt safe when grandma was around, no matter what was going on outside, everything seemed alright with the world. Even this, we were no longer mourning Sadie's death, we began celebrating her. We began a round of toasts. I think just about everyone had something special to say about Sadie.<br/><br/><b>Who made the first toast, and what did they have to say?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339032/#Comment_339032" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T11:40:36+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 11:40AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Damn!

But it did made for an interesting twist.)<br/><br/>Always the eloquent one, Peter was the first to raise his glass. "For Sadie. We'll always remember her selfless way of loving us all. By her side, you always felt accepted and understood. She was the fresh air when any of us felt the pressures and expectations were about to suffocate us."<br/><br/>And then everyone started toasting. She truly was a very special woman, and in one way or another she touched each one of us.<br/><br/>At last, I was the only one who had not said anything. Me, being the closest one to her. I could feel everyone's eyes on me, waiting for what I'd had to say. But somehow the words escaped my mouth before I had the time to think about it. I started talking, revelling some secrets I could only dare sharing now that she was gone. I knew my story would shock most of them, but I was unable to stop now.<br/><br/><b>What secret story about Sadie did I reveal?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339286/#Comment_339286" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T15:08:56+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  3:08PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Maybe we should have set up some lines and veils before this started. Consider yourself warned.)<br/><br/>And I found myself telling them about the time, a year before, when I discovered Karen - the girl I wanted - making out with that Australian kid at Duncan's party. How I got drunk and sat in the lawn chair in the bathtub, shivering, crying, three in the morning, the house heating system shut off for the night.  And how Sadie found me there, and comforted me, me complaining that I was too ugly, a loser, it was never going to happen for me. And her showing me that I wasn't a loser. And making it happen for me.<br/><br/>Foolish to reveal that. I try to make them understand, that it was just her way of loving and accepting and understanding - that what she and I did just didn't feel wrong - that after that night I was a new person, whole. Karen and I never would have gotten together if it wasn't for the confidence that Sadie gave me on that night! But the looks in their eyes. Even grandma, who I could always count on to understand, the look on her face ... I never want them to look at me this way again.<br/><br/><b>What did I do then?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
