So a good initiation is one that front-loads that with stakes freighted with meaning for that relationship, in my opinion anyway.  <br/><br/>A trait like "I stole", in the context of an initiation, says volumes.  It's not about whether you succeed or fail at some task, it is all about how you view the Order and how the Order views you back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94679/#Comment_94679" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T10:16:16+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 10:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 10:16AM by John_Harper.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [cross-posted with Jason]<br/><br/>One of the key bits of goodness is that the initiation asks you to put a part of the character at stake for change. This is done by framing every initiation conflict as an "I hope..." statement about the character, like, "I hope I was able to master my temper." Then you either win or lose, and that aspect of your character is reinforced or altered accordingly. Since this is the very first activity of the game, it trains you to expect this kind of character change/growth in future play.<br/><br/>It's also very subtle, in its way. Dogs is <i>about</i> how the Dogs themselves change and grow over time, but for many players (myself included) I was so focused on judging the towns that I missed this core game idea for a little while. But it's all right there in your very first scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94680/#Comment_94680" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T10:20:55+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 10:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>...it frames the character's relationship with the Order.</i><br/><br/>I don't think that's necessarily true, Jason.

The bad one was with a pacifist who wanted to see that any problem could be solved without violence.  So, he had to interrogate and reform this unrepentable sinner.  I could have played it differently (like making the last raise "You see that there's only one way to prevent him from hurting others again. Killing him.") or something like that, but the bottom line is that I should have stepped out of the scene and really pushed the "tutorial" nature of the initiation.  Telling the player, if you lose this, you <i>will</i> have to kill him.  Because the ending narration was that the player returned to the elders, and didn't want to kill the man. So, the fallout was an extended narration where he found him a couple of weeks later, after having caused more harm and trouble, and finally killing him.  Having so much happen after the last roll, it didn't really feel connected to the conflict we just had. The big problem was there was a disconnect between the stakes and player control. I'm still not sure if it was just the way it played out or the initiation scene wasn't condusive to the stakes.  I'm betting on the latter.<br/><br/>The next one was centered around the voices the character hears in her head, learning to control them (there was an implicit question - is she crazy or is the King of Life speaking to her?). At first, it was all medatative with an elder helping her quiet and listen to the voice. It was getting muddled, and and she was losing, and the meditation ended.  But the conflict was still going on.  So, I had a voice tell her the water in the well (which she was tasked to bring in) was poisoned.  So she went about testing it, and eventually won the conflict - the water <i>was</i> poisoned.  We decided that she didn't learn to control the voice, exactly, but that the voice was telling her the truth, so she learned to trust it.<br/><br/>So, I guess my lesson is, set up your scenes carefully and if you see it not working, change the scene as soon as possible and continue the conflict in a new scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94717/#Comment_94717" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T11:38:27+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 11:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You want to see your dead father?

I believe (at least it becomes known to them). So no matter what you do, Jason's right, it'll give you a relationship to the order. Even if it's just passed or failed.

Its starts getting late, but the herd is scattered. They didn't bring any provisions for a night out and the younger Dogs start questioning his leadership and demand to go back. When he refuses they just up and start to leave. That's when he escalated to fighting and knocked one of them off his horse, winning the conflict (I was out of dice).

Maybe they've read the book but want to see how the very different mechanics work, and sometimes all they come in knowing is people seem excited about the game, so what's up with that?<br/><br/>I heartily recommend jenskot's approach of talking to the players about the NPCs in the town they'll be going to, and making sure everyone has a relationship to one of them. It's a different matter, passing judgment on your own kin,<br/>and dealing with people you have history with.  The Dogs have to care about the communities they're preserving and the people in them, and initiations and relationships are a terrific way of making that happen quickly.<br/><br/>Another technique that works really well is to include the other PC Dogs in the initiations, with that player's permission.  I'll never forget the way both players eyes lit up with enthusiasm in "I hope I learned humility" when I raised big with "And one of the other Dog candidates thinks you're being uppity so he lassoes your ankle and drags you through a cactus patch" and a player asked "Oh!  Can that have been me that did that?"  That was sweet.<br/>Since then, I'll sometimes offer the chance to intertwine stories like that, and it's eagerly accepted, because it right away builds in links between the Dogs.<br/><br/>Just last Saturday at Endgame's minicon, Brother Malachi, who at 13 killed a boy he hated for stealing from him, <br/>got sent to the Dog's Temple to cool tempers in his Branch, and wound up becoming a candidate a few years later. He had the initiation  "I hope I made a friend", and when I raised with "One of the other candidates thinks you're a no good murderer that should never be a Dog and gathers up some of his more holier-than-thou fellows to give you a beating with axe handles out behind the barn" and Malachi took the d8 blow by holding tight to the rock he'd killed that boy with, which he'd kept, but not fighting back, and not ratting them out to the instructors after, Brother Philip, who had anger issues of his own, said "Can I be one of the guys who beat him, but I'm impressed by the way he took it, and over time I'm that friend he made?" and both of the players loved that.  And so it was.<br/><br/>And in the town, the farmer's wife that wanted them to annul her loveless marriage was the aunt of that boy Brother Malachi had killed years ago.  And so forth.<br/><br/>I haven't figured out what makes some initiations sing and some just hum, but I'm working on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
