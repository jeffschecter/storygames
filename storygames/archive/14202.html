Broadly:<br/><br/>First,  is fidelity important to that group? Some games assume high or low fidelity, but any game can be played with varying degrees of truthiness. <br/>Second, the player - does he know enough about the setting to fake it convincingly?<br/><br/>Low fidelity + high knowledge = irritating player (I hate this guy. He is often me)<br/>Low fidelity + low knowledge = fun for everyone (Who cares? Go for it!)<br/>High fidelity + low knowledge = uncomfortable player (History panic)<br/>High fidelity + high knowledge = fun for everyone (Wait, *you* set up Bellingham to shoot Spencer Perceval?")<br/><br/>The only situation you need to worry about are games that, by choice or design, are going to be high fidelity. Those games(or social groups) need to have some way to support and encourage low knowledge players, who will be almost everybody. If games (or social groups) also help high-knowledge jack-holes loosen up and accept ahistorical but ultimately unimportant input, so much the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322214/#Comment_322214" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T08:38:00+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  8:38AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I think there are a few things going on here.<br/><br/>1. History feels like schoolwork. (I think this is one reason people avoid Steal Away Jordan. They like the idea, but it sounds like work.)<br/><br/>2. People are interested in tiny little niches of history. For example, I like Regency, but I find medieval history rather dull. Your niche may not be my niche.<br/><br/>3. History is culture-specific. When I played <i>How We Came To Live Here</i>, I found it difficult, because I know nothing about Native American history. I just had no reference point. Similarly, I think, I'm much more interested in 1930s England than many Americans.<br/><br/>4. There's often an imperative to get history <i>right</i>. When we play Apocalypse World, we can invent <i>anything</i>, but when we play Grey Ranks, we want to know what Poland was actually like.<br/><br/>5. History is often seen through modern, rational eyes. People in Regency England thought ghosts, demons and boggarts existed. But, because we see history through rational eyes, we eliminate all those things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322220/#Comment_322220" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T08:46:32+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  8:46AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2011 9:27AM by mease19.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding abatement of "history panic," I think a "History's Mysteries" approach is best.

Sometimes they are actually fairly knowledgeable which creates a situation where they think they are always right.

It feels like you're about to have a History exam that you haven't studied for at all, and now my coolness in the group cannot be measured by my creativity and ability to riff on other players' ideas but also on details and unspoken contextual information awareness.<br/><br/>I can play an orc because I can make up with orcs are like during play.*<br/>I can't play a coal miner in the 1920s because I feel bound to "get it right", often only on a personal level. Speech, mannerisms, education seem to become more important than the normal human issues that most everyone can roleplay like being a drunk or weeping over a dead wife. A "you ought to know this" feeling.<br/><br/>It's mostly (edit: completely) irrational. Also, the more specific the historical setting, the worse it can be. A game set in a decade (say, the 50s) would make me feel less panicky than set in the summer of 1954. The 50s I can make into a stereotype or draw on tropes, but now in the summer of '54 I might want to know certain things.<br/><br/>* - In games where there are racial strictures and "no you wouldn't do that" scenarios I get frustrated, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322224/#Comment_322224" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T08:50:08+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  8:50AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I like what Jason is saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me I dont usually have much interest in historical games and if I do it would be of the low fidelity variety.  I much prefer something like George RR Martin's A game of Thrones, loosely inspired by the War of the Roses.

Because that's my next game project - a Vampire: the Requiem game set in Poland in 1796.  That's right folks, put on your bike helmets to prevent brain damage, JDC's going to talk about his Vampire game!<br/><br/>But first I'm going to tell you about a D&amp;D game.<br/><br/>It was set in the Scarred Lands, a really kickass setting concocted by White Wolf. I don't want to get too far on a tangent but the reason I like the Scarred Lands is that it <i>really really needs heroes.</i>  It's not like a lot of dark fantasy games where things are just dismal, in the Scarred Lands things are dismal but if there was just a ragtag gang of hot-cha adventurers in implausible armor who could come in with quips and derring-do, things might just start looking up. <br/><br/>Anyway, the game was set in a city that at the time had not been detailed by White Wolf. (Eventually it would be but I liked mine better and nobody else cared at that point.) I went into considerable detail in detailing the coinage, calendar, daily life, etc. of this fantasy city and gave the packet to the players.<br/><br/>Then I got really annoyed because all of the questions I was getting were answered in the packet and gps were still just "gold pieces", not the actual name of the coin. It was, in my view, killing the atmosphere I was trying to create. I was having these NPCs say all sorts of awesome stuff and the players might as well have been playing Greyhawk or some other D&amp;D setting. I got pretty pissed off, felt like my contribution was wasted, etc. That is the feeling the setting buff gets when people blunder over something they tried to establish, whether it is a fictional setting or a nonfictional one.<br/><br/>Afterwards I realized this was all happening because I was a fucking moron.<br/><br/>I had just given these packets to the players without explaining my expectations or goals.  What, were they just supposed to read my mind and know what I wanted? I put my attacks of opportunity FAQ in the same packet, for god's sake. I didn't expect their characters to say "hurrr, I really stabbed that guy with an attack of opportunity". <br/><br/>Fast forward to today.<br/><br/>After getting psyched about Vampire: the Requiem, I do what I do with all games - ruin it by doing something with it the authors wouldn't ever give a shit about and would think I was stupid <i>or maybe brilliant</i> for doing.  In this case, I wanted to run a historical game, but in a setting that most American games more or less shit on and ignore: Eastern Europe (hats off to e23 for their GURPS WWII supplements for Poland and Romania, though...).  So I took Napoleonic Poland (just after the last partition) and I wrote up a one-page precis on life in Poland in that time.<br/><br/>When I presented the page to the players I said, "I expect you to know everything on this page, and to use the terms defined on this page in conversation, and when I refer to something on this page I expect you'll be able to have your character converse intelligently about it."<br/><br/>Then I said, "If there is some historical question that is not related to something on this page, I don't care if you know it or not, I will be happy to answer it if I can, and if you forget the answer, that's okay, I'll answer it again. If I don't know the answer, I'll establish an answer as true for our game - after all, we're already positting that vampires exist, why not a little historical wiggle room?"<br/><br/>And: "If you surmise something that historically turns out not to be true or there is some historical reason that something you're working on wouldn't work, I promise to intervene and explain things. <i>You</i> promise not to get upset at this. This arrangement of page and JDC knowledge exists in lieu of you knowing anything about Poland in 1796."<br/><br/>All three of those things work in concert. The page satisfies me that there is something about the setting that they'll know and they won't stumble over a prop while they're popping about the stage. The use of me as historical fact repository/decisionmaker eliminates endless attempts to remember something they saw on the Discovery Channel. And the intervention guarantees that the players won't concoct a plan involving something that won't be invented/developed/widespread for fifty years...  ("We'll catch him, we'll take the train!" "Um...no." ) ...while at the same time cautioning them not to leap right to the edge of the envelope of the setting and invest in a plan that might not be feasible in the setting, hopefully dampening disappointments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322248/#Comment_322248" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T10:23:04+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 10:23AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>So perhaps that's worth exploring\u2014how to break fidelity in well-understood ways.</blockquote> I think that this is the most interesting element of <i>Bloody Forks of the Ohio</i> - I mean, other than the fact that it's one of the few games where Pittsburgh matters. There are a few characters who have sorcery-related tags and secrets, which you can make as literal as you like. To me, that's permission to ignore the historical facts where they're not dramatic and tell my own story, inspired by the bits that were good enough to remember. It carves out a space where History Panic Guy or Often Jason needs to back off and let me do my thing.<br/><br/>Among my history-inspired games have been a couple of sessions of "Puppetland" drawn from events in recent Middle Eastern history, and a short campaign of Renaissance-era <i>Vampire</i>. Both games immediately give us that safe space between the facts as they were and our story, and both were very, very good. I'd have written "enjoyable" but actually the Puppetland games were terribly exhausting, even a little angry, because of the high level of engagement. Immensely fulfilling, though, and the only time I've felt like I was playing in (what I'd now call) "I Will Not Abandon You" mode. There, the historical inspiration worked for the groups to give us fluency and get us all into a richly-established fiction, if that's the right word, before the game began.<br/><br/>On the other hand, my only attempt at 1920s-era Cthulhu ended in a kind of disaster because of an Often Jason moment. One of the players wanted to know if there were paper towels in the 1920s, and I didn't know. It threw me off for the rest of the session and I vowed never to return. The whole part about magically murdering people by speaking the name of a fictional god didn't bother me, but the paper towels did. Interestingly, I later noticed in the Keeper's Compendium that that VERY FACT was given as an example of the kind of detail you shouldn't get hung up over, but hung up is exactly what I got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322250/#Comment_322250" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T10:55:41+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 10:55AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Corley, did people really respond well to the packet?

I felt like <i>the game</i> was stupid. When I played Montsegur and was like, "Wait - is everyone in Montsegur a Cathar? Why do they have children if they don't approve of sex?" I felt like <i>I</i> was stupid.<br/><br/>And if I shit on the Vampire setting and just make up my own stuff? I'm awesome. But if I shit on history? Then I've just shat on history!<br/><br/>With Montsegur, we definitely had history panic.

We worked through it and it was awesome, but...<br/><br/>...still a problem. I don't care about Glorantha, Greyhawk, or the Tremere. (And why should I?) I also don't care about most history.

That is, how can you-as-the-designer give enough info that people who have only an interest in and not a knowledge of the period of your game will feel it's a useful resource to them? Er, awkward, but I hope clear enough. Particularly, I mean a useful resource for getting over history panic, not for teaching them history.</blockquote>\nWell, don't close all the doors, one way to get over history panic is to teach them history.  I think some people are open to learning real stuff as a part of learning to play a game.  That's one reason the "are there paper towels in 1920?" is an important question to some groups.  They want to know!  <br/><br/>Now, there should be some procedure for what to do in the moment when questions like that come up and nobody knows the answer. For example, in my Poland game, there was a clear answer: Jason will give you the answer and it will be true for the game until we decide otherwise.  So for example, if someone said "Hey, is there corn raised in Poland in 1796?", which is an interesting question because it was introduced to Europe by American explorers a hundred years previous, and it quickly became quite popular, but how quickly and how popular and where, I don't know off the top of my head.  The <i>wrong</i> thing to do is think that the answer doesn't matter.  The <i>right</i> thing to do is to say, "Well, let's say there is, and when we come back next time, if I don't have a definitive answer, we'll just go with that."  If it turns out I'm wrong, then we can either replace corn with some other cereal crop or just go with the alternate history-ness of it all.  <br/><br/>I don't have any game design insights, and if I do ever have one, just let me know and I'll go somewhere quiet and shoot myself, but as far as a game runner goes, the main thing is to identify your goals and the goals of the group, and tailor the history (as you would with any other thing in the game) to those goals.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>I'll give you one exactly but not two - when I played Vampire and was like, "What, I've got to know all this shit about which clan does what?" I felt like<i>the game</i>was stupid. When I played Montsegur and was like, "Wait - is everyone in Montsegur a Cathar? Why do they have children if they don't approve of sex?" I felt like<i>I</i>was stupid.</blockquote>\nIn both cases, neither the game nor you was stupid, and your feeling was baseless.  In both cases the <i>role of the setting element</i> in the game did not match your goals for the game.  There are plenty of Vampire groups out there that gobble up and absorb all those details, they love to do it, in fact if you don't use as much of those details as you can, they aren't as fulfilled in the game.  Are they smart and you stupid? Certainly not, they just have a different goal and a different relationship to the written material as a result of that goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322263/#Comment_322263" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T11:30:34+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 11:30AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>1.

None of us care overly about getting the details exactly right, but we can still get caught up in those "paper towel moments" where we're sidetracked for a time.  "How much electricity would a small town on the Oregon coast even have in 1920? The Seaview Inn, if that?" "Would even Thomas Malaney have an automobile?"<br/><br/>We use systems with simple mechanics and/or quick resolution most of the time so we can keep a certain flow, but even though we try not to be pedantic about historical details, it can upset that flow every now and then.<br/><br/>I probably get the most panic; I never finished my thesis but I banked nearly enough grad credit for a doctorate in U.S. history.  Little of that knowledge seems to provide any of the details that seem to come up in period role-playing, but I frequently "feel" like it should and am embarrased that's not the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322274/#Comment_322274" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T12:02:30+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 12:02PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does anyone stop and look it up when they have a paper towel moment? <br/><br/>I've always gone with "let's just say it's this" but with information appliances so readily available these days I wonder how much flow is actually broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322275/#Comment_322275" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T12:08:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 12:08PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, please don't be scared of being scared.

Someone draws the "There was a riot in the Abbleton Mill!" card and boom, it happens, without requiring extensive player knowledge.<br/><br/>But, if you're asking more from the players, asking them to come up with appropriate plots and stuff, then you need to provide them with the tools to do that.

And to be a safe space you need to lower expectations.<br/><br/>Like a brainstorm session, you don't tear down people's ideas, instead you encourage people to dig deep and share without hesitation for brainstorming to work. Otherwise people will pull back and refuse to participate.<br/><br/>I'm not saying "anything is allowed" but if you expect everything in an RPG to be "correct", you're going to have a lot of problems. And it isn't just limited to historical accuracy. It applies to anything that may ruin your suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>For example, I play with a lot of actors. In RPGs, many of us "act". But our acting sucks. And that's ok, it's part of the fun. We don't require acting training to participate in RPGs. Yet I know a lot of non-gamers who are afraid to participate because they think they have to be good actors to roleplay. <br/><br/>Now if every time our acting wasn't awesome my acting friends threw up their arms and declared "you're breaking my suspension of disbelief" then we couldn't play together. But they know better. Why would you expect someone else to match your level of skill without your talent or years of training? You wouldn't. You take pride in what you can do because you earned it.  And expecting the same skill from a novice makes no sense. And seeing that an RPG isn't "acting class", you let it go. <br/><br/>Have you noticed how a crappy movie can be unwatchable but fun to play as an RPG? RPGs lower the bar and let people who normally have no business being actors, writers, or tacticians have fun with it without expectations of being professional. And as long as people are patient and suspend their disbelief it can be tremendous fun. <br/><br/>And here is the thing. Most of us are constantly suspending our disbelief. We're ignorant of 90% of the world because there is just too much to know and little time to experience it all. So when you do most things in an RPG, there is probably someone else at the table who knows much more than you do about whatever you are describing in the fiction. And if every time someone who knows more than you stops the game to educate you\u2026 we would spend more time in the "class room" than in having fun playing. This doesn't just pertain to history but for reasons I don't understand, a lot of history buffs have a problem letting go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322297/#Comment_322297" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T14:56:13+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  2:56PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's interesting that a particular word has not yet come up in this thread, especially considering that I figured it originates most of the history/culture panic I've ever seen; that word is "racist."

I tend to trip over the same thing in historical games outside my limited spheres of history knowledge as I do in, say, medieval-ish fantasy settings:  I don't know what people <i>do</i> there, not the way I would about a modern setting or a science fiction setting.  I'm not worrying about screwing up whether this town is in Daggerdale or Shadowdale or Greendale, or whether Queen Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837 or 1835 or 1980, so much as I'm worrying about knowing what a character does after work, what he talks about with his friends, what kinds of plans he can make to accomplish his goals, etc..<br/><br/>In a setting I'm comfortable with, I know I can come up with plausible, workable answers for pretty much anything my character might do, say, or feel.  I know what fits and what details I can incorporate and add color to without screwing things up.  All of my own knowledge is a resource that I can use to really engage with the game and be a part of it.<br/><br/>In settings I'm not comfortable with, I can't do that.  Worse yet, sometimes I start feeling like my own knowledge is an obstacle rather than an asset, like I need to think twice about what I'm about to say to weed out anachronisms and other things that no one in the setting's culture would think or do.  If the situation is "Little Jimmy is very sick," should my character react the way I would (holy shit, let's go to a doctor, let's <i>figure out how to cure Jimmy</i>!), or should he react some other way ("Oh no, God is taking Little Jimmy from us, time to build a coffin.")?  It's doable, but it's also an additional cognitive load that isn't really helping me have FUN.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322301/#Comment_322301" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T16:41:21+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  4:41PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the comment has been made that this is similar to playing in an ultra-detailed fantasy setting.  But there is a key difference that depends on game type.  If the game is D&amp;D played in what I believe is the traditional way only one person is responsible for pulling the setting into the game.  And that person has time to research/prepare ahead of time.  In many/most story games everyone is expected to participate in pulling the setting into the game, and typically they are expected to do it on the fly.<br/><br/>I once ran an Ars Magica game set in Oxford just as the University there was growing to prominence.  Even though I am extremely poor on history I was able to spend a day or two tooling around looking into the era and prep.<br/><br/>I am currently in a Dresden game where there is a constant annoying tension with trying to fit all the events into the books timeline.  "Who is the Summer Lady now?"  'It can't be her because Harry's para-net isn't functioning yet."  "But the vampires are currently..."<br/><br/>When I see historical story-games I tend to be reluctant, because I am bad at history.  Even with time to prep I'm not going to be able to really bring it.  Jason's post talking about ignoring the little details another player got wrong is really key.  I think another thing that makes a difference is the scale and scope of the game.  Grey Ranks worked well for me despite my anxieties because none of the key people of the era or order of events mattered (or at least had to be brought by the players).   It was just a game about the people and the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

For Forgotten Realms, a crazy-powerful ancient artifact, a crazed evil wizard and a hot chick (or dude, fight the patriarchy) with two daggers can make a plot more or less anywhere to accomplish more or less anything. Those are just part of the language of the Forgotten Realms.  And with a Western, it's similar: a gang of bandits, a beleagured group of agriculturalists, a saloon, bang, you've extended the situation.  In Poland 1796?

Someone who, culturally speaking, is never going to be expected to behave properly or belong with normal people.  Basically, we agree that I as a player am not going to be expected to know a lot about how a typical person in the setting would behave, and that I'm okay with my character suffering some consequences for being a weirdo.<br/><br/>It works fine in actual play -- we've had some great games in historical settings where essentially the entire party was made up of weirdos who collide with their surrounding culture more than they mesh with it -- but it's a different experience than playing in a setting that everyone is comfortable and familiar with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322479/#Comment_322479" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T01:21:23+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  1:21AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend and I wrote a game (a teaching game for junior entrepreneurs) based on the career of Christopher Columbus. We're both educated historians, but we knew that the great majority of players wouldn't be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we took great care to tell the players that for the purposes of this game, history was something to be mined for cool stuff, not to be held accountable for. To get this across to the players, we included a couple of warm-up exercises that train the players to improvise stuff on the basis of bits and pieces of historical materials. Oh, and during the game, the players have a list of bits and pieces of historical stuff in front of them that they can plunder, in addition to whatever material they get from scene cards. The major point of the warm-up exercises as regards history panic is to establish as social contract between the players that it's really OK to go with it. So pockets were not yet invented in 1600? If you need your character to pull stuff out of a pocket, go ahead. So the players are negotiationg over ten million maravedis to outfit the expedition? In reality the relevant amount would have been 100.000, but is that important for the game? The important bit is that they're wrangling over money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that as an actual historian, I'm a lot less prudish about the details of these things than many laypeople.

But yeah, race is certainly front and center with <i>SAJ</i>, and more fraught in situations where there's actual historical precedent to incorporate into any game. Being a bleeding heart is hard work.<br/><br/>The pleasure and engagement of vicariously exploring those situations is tempered by the certain knowledge that there are ways to play in such games that are <i>objectively incorrect</i>, and I suspect that like most nerds, I'm more scared of being<i> wrong</i> than necessarily of offending someone.<br/><br/>That said, yes, it's probably easier than I am making it out to be to create a space where it's OK to screw up now and then as long as everyone is sincere and open-minded. I guess you just need to be explicit about that at the outset. It intrigues me that we don't worry so much about it in games like Fiasco, because it's just expected that a lot of those characters are going to be douchebags by default and can just roll any fuck-ups right into the fiction.<br/><br/>Upon reflection, I realize that nearly every time I create a new PC in a setting I am not familiar with, I tend to create a 'stranger in a strange land' guy who can learn about the culture and local history dynamically as the game progresses.

Not as a Lecture or anything, but more of a "this was really interesting, and hey here's a little more information about the actual real events" sort of thing. It might be cool to have a scheduled "Here's where you diverged from Capital-H History. No big, but now you have more knowledge!" session or something.<br/><br/>Ex: When I watched Fast Five the other day with folks, Lisa just graduated with a forensic biology degree, a bonefide CSI type person. When the Investigators were doing their Investigating, or the Mossoud (sp?) chick was handling guns, we could tell she was squirming but she held it all in admirably. We all loved the movie and had a great time especially Lisa, but after we said "Alrighty, Lisa, Spill It" and she got to let off about 15 minutes of steam about how they would have ruined evidence, how everyone does X, hwo no one does Y, and how fingerprints or other matter can be easily compromised. It was a cool lesson On Top Of a fun, light action movie, and it really has parallels to what you say above, I believe.  <br/><br/>Like, if she started ranting in the theater, even in whispers, that would have been Meh. But instead, we all had a laugh and she told us where they diverted from Reality. I do the same thing with Hacker Movies (who in computers Doesn't Do This, right?). I dig it. Maybe it just needs to be structured/formalized, even in just a sentence about what to do during cleanup after the game? <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323716/#Comment_323716" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T05:03:18+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  5:03AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have history &amp; cultural panic.<br/><br/>The major factor here is that I have almost no memory for history. I would love to have it, but nope, doesn't work that way. <br/><br/>My first Real RPG Design was "Draug", for which I spent a year or two studying Norwegian history &amp; culture in the 1800s. I was really afraid to get things wrong. It reads like a high-school history book in many places, I think. A major investment of time and effort. I don't remember much of what's in the book anymore; when we played the game, a lot of information never came into play, or was irrelevant. <br/><br/>It's annoying to feel like you ought to know stuff, in order not to offend an authority external to the playing group. I guess I see History as such an authority, somehow. I hate getting historical facts wrong in a historical game. (And I don't much like getting the gods and countries and factions wrong in Glorantha, either). I have way too high expectations of historical correctness, much higher than what I could actually fulfil myself. <br/><br/>This is the reason why Society of Dreamers does not use Real History. It only uses whatever players establish, whatever might exist in their forgetful and ever-more-drunken minds as play progresses. It's set in, um, Europe, in, well, the 18th century or something. Go!<br/><br/>Did they have cigarettes and cinemas in Poland at that time? (What time?) Sure they did, you just said you were having a cigarette outside the cinema. Much more interesting: Who's that guy you're trying to pick up?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323718/#Comment_323718" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T05:28:12+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  5:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Was curious: AFTER the game, like during cleanup and and the like, did you tell them what really happened or "My inner high voice was doing This when you did That", etc?</blockquote>\nUsually not, unless someone asks.
