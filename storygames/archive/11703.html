Yay crowdsourcing!<br/><br/>Since the writing for the game section of the Blowback text is 80% done, I'm starting to think about the appendices that will help get people into that spy mindset. Besides a glossary of terms, I'd like to have a section with overviews of various towns and cities, small and large, that provide jumping-off points for people who've never been there. (The idea is that you either run the game someplace everyone knows really well, or someplace that no one has ever been to.) By giving a big-picture explanation of what the place is like, there will be just enough reality to give people an idea of what to make up.<br/><br/>I figure it'll give a good mix of geographic locations, population sizes, and whatnot. Write one (or more) up, and I'll put it in the book along with a thank you. Coolest one gets a free hardcopy of the finished product!

That is, the only people to carry weapons are a special tactics unit called the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), who dress in an appropriately scary manner. Normal police, called the Garda\xed, carry batons. Crime in Ireland is very rarely gun crime (unless drugs are involved). However, it is rumoured that the Russians and the Chinese gangs are armed. The thing is, crime syndicates keep to themselves. It is supposed that if a mafia style organisation started pushing too hard they'd get a call from the locals (a certain <i>disbanded </i>military organisation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261262/#Comment_261262" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:51:21+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:51AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 12:56PM by Emily_Care.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Milford, CT</b><br/><br/><b>Population:</b> 50K+<br/><b>Terrain:</b> coastal, founded at mouth of the Wepawaug and larger Housatonic River, rolling farmland to the north being turned into developments, beach areas split between huge multi-million dollar homes and small single family ranch houses, Audubon and State parks along seashore: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI-LuLf506s" rel="nofollow">Silver Sands State Park</a> created after holdout "Chicken Lady" who lived/squatted on the beach in a mobile home died and allowed work to go forward.<br/><b>Strategic locations: </b> Washington Bridge: historic site, longest drawbridge on the Boston Post Road;

As a port, Geelong orients itself towards the water and the beach. The central business district is located directly above the city's major beach, which features an old 19th century waterfront boardwalk - shared by tourists during the day and drug dealers at night. Generally, the more affluent suburbs are found to the south and west, or a little along the Penisula, while the industrial northern region of Corio and North Shore is where the vast majority of crime and poverty is located, as well as the bulk of the city's industry. The Barwon River also winds its way through the city's west and south, but flows out into the huge saltwater Lake Connewarre and from there into the ocean, rather than making its way through the CBD to the bay.<br/><br/><b>Strategic locations:</b> The Port of Geelong is the major grain port for the entire state, with massive silos lined up along the shore. It also provides an attractive location for some of the state's heavy industry - the Alcoa aluminium refinery at Port Henry, the massive Shell oil refinery at Corio (located next door to the country's most elite private school, Geelong Grammar), and the Ford motor plant. A few kilometres north of the town sits Her Majesty's Prison Barwon, the most secure prison in the state.There is also a major airport (Avalon Airport, located north of the city), and the country's largest animal research laboratory (the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory), which has a massive incinerator tower for destroying the corpses of diseased animals <i>(and possibly unlucky spies)</i>.<br/><br/><b>Racial makeup:</b> Primarily white, but with increasing an increasing Asian-Australian presence, and a small but growing population of Sudanese and Somalian refugees.<br/><br/><b>Neighbourhoods:</b> North Geelong, North Shore, Norlane, Corio (impoverished northern suburbs, shading to bushland at the fringes of Corio); Newtown, Geelong West (moderately affluent, old inner-city suburbs); Bell Post Hill, Hamlyn Heights, Manifold Heights (hilly affluent western suburbs); Waurn Ponds, Belmont, Grovedale (southwestern middle-class suburbs on the urban fringe); Newcomb, Breakwater (growing eastern suburbs); Leopold, Drysdale, Clifton Springs (Bellarine towns, still maintaining somewhat of separate identity and some rural area between the city and themselves, but essentially Geelong suburbs); Torquay, Ocean Grove, Barwon Heads (oceanfront beach towns along the Bellarine Penisula, rapidly growing in size)<br/><br/><b>Areas with heavy foot traffic:</b> The central business district (especially on a Friday night), Deakin University at Waurn Ponds, Pakington Street (the new, cooler shopping district), Eastern Beach and the boardwalk, Geelong Railway Station<br/><br/><b>Areas with little traffic:</b> Barwon riverbanks, the entire city during a Cats Grand Final, the port district at night<br/><br/><b>BONUS, headlines: </b><br/><i>- GRANNY KILLER TWIST: Judge weighs into naming child criminals debate<br/>- Geelong knife-threat schoolgirl's fate known today<br/>- Nasty wake-up as car smashes St Albans Park house<br/>- Geelong Cats roll out the big gun for Perth practice match</i><br/><br/><b>BONUS, local knowledge: </b><br/><br/>The local (Australian) football team, the Geelong Cats, are central to the city's self-identity. When the Cats are doing well, the city does well - and they're doing well right now. The <i>Geelong Advertiser </i>(the Addy) devotes multiple pages to the Cats, even in the off-season, and if the Cats are playing in a premiership match, the entire city is deserted as everyone flocks either to the stadium or to their couch to watch it on the box. While the Grand Final is on the television, anyone could do <i>anything</i>, even in the Central Business District, and it would go un-noticed.<br/><br/>Geelong Grammar is probably the Australasian region's most well-known and well-respected private school. The place is packed with the children of the Indonesian, Malaysian, and Thai elites, along with those of wealthy Australians and occasional members of the British Royal Family. Someone looking for serious leverage could probably find it by kidnapping the right student from the school's boarding houses. Oddly enough, the campus is set within the city's poorer northern district, directly under the looming stacks of the Shell oil refinery, an island of privilege in a sea of poverty and industry.<br/><br/>One prominent local property developer, Frank Costa, seems to have his fingers in almost every pie going around the city. He's the president of the Geelong Cats, the key sponsor of many of the city's cultural events, and he has the main hall of Deakin University's Waterfront Campus named after him - and is simultaneously well-loved and suspected to be a massive crook by the public at large.<br/><br/>The city's marina is filled with hundreds and hundreds of private boats and yachts, most of which are used once or twice a year by their owners, if ever. Security on the waterfront is relatively lax and traffic is light on the actual piers, so it would be fairly easy for someone desperate for a boat to pick one up from the marina.<br/><br/><b>BONUS, pictures: </b><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.daytours-victoria.com.au/images/Eastern-beach-2.jpg"/><br/>Eastern Beach<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://davidwallphoto.com/images/%7B2EED6DF4-037C-48BB-9321-D4A1710EB400%7D.jpg"/><br/>Geelong from the waterfront<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3156/3052094623_c5069befd8.jpg"/><br/>CBD backstreet<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/images/uploadedfiles/editorial/pictures/2009/03/27/29costa2_(350_x_235).jpg"/><br/>Local titan Frank Costa                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
