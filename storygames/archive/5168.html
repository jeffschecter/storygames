I know that the list below leaves out quite a few games and the dates may be off a bit but here is my RPG r\xe9sum\xe9.<br/><br/>Basic and Expert D&amp;D (1980)<br/>I was 8 years old and  this was the first game I played with a friend and his fathers group. The game was packed and you had to wait for an opening to play. I was so exited when I was finally allowed in the group.<br/><br/>That didn\u2019t last too long since my mother fell prey to the whole D&amp;D scare and forbade me to play. <br/><br/>Star Frontier<br/>This was the compromise game since it didn\u2019t deal with magic and demons. Crash on Volturnus rocked and I was hooked.<br/><br/>Eventually my mother came around and I was officially allowed to play D&amp;D even though I was playing in secret for a while. I played in several groups and ran a few of my own. For a while that was pretty much it for me. I eventually graduated to Advanced D&amp;D around 1983 and started playing with the \u201cbig kids\u201d. I was also making tweaks to my games and coming up with home brews that were very bad fantasy heartbreakers.<br/><br/>1983<br/>Gamma World<br/>My friend hipped me to this game during a D&amp;D session where we were transported to the blasted earth of the future. I hated this game and thought it sucked.<br/><br/>1985?<br/>The first RPG Golden Age<br/>My friend Dan (who I played AD&amp;D with) gave me this box of games his brother (I think) bought at the swap meet. He was never going to play them and knew I was a RPG fiend. That day opened my eyes to gaming in so many different ways. Up until that point it was D&amp;D , Star frontiers and Gamma World. I knew of others from reading Dragon but had no idea there were others out there. <br/>The games were:<br/>Aftermath<br/>Danger Incorporated (I think this was the name)<br/>Villains and Vigilantes with supplements<br/>Superworld<br/>Call of Cthulhu with supplements<br/>Stormbringer with supplments<br/>Dragonraid<br/><br/>I kept all of them except Aftermath, Danger incorporated, and Dragonraid. I kick myself for that since now I would like to have them to look over from time to time. <br/><br/>Of the lot I loved Stormbringer the most followed by Call of Cthulhu and Villains and Vigilantes. Superworld wasn\u2019t as cool looking a super\u2019s game as V&amp;V but it did share a common system with the other Chaosium games.<br/><br/>1986- (My experimental phase)<br/>I became a gaming whore trying everything from Champions to Car Wars. I was a cheap RPG whore who didn\u2019t care whos dice I polished. I played everything with everyone. I stuck primarily with AD&amp;D but everyone new that I was down for midnight booty calls with strange games. <br/>I found Star Wars this year too. I played the hell out of this game and the other West End Game Ghost Busters. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I drug into gaming with this one. <br/><br/>That all came to an end when I found Robotech<br/><br/>AD&amp;D and Stormbringer were my sold fixes for RPG entertainment but Robotech made me flip out. I loved the anime and was a huge fane of shows like Gundam and Dragonar so this game was made for me. I soon found Palladium fantasy (which I didn\u2019t like at the time), TMNT which I loved as much as Robotech being a comic fan too, and heroes Unlimited which I loved because I loved the other Palladium games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.

When I got home and went to my hobby store I found a new love: Warhammer 40k. I blew almost my entire wad on the books and armies.  Bought a Space marine army, Eldar, am Ork and the core book with some terrain. I would have bought more but the salesperson actually stopped me and suggested I play with what I had to see if I liked it.<br/><br/>I loved the game and played with anyone who would play or could afford to. <br/><br/>This was also the year that I finally got a hold of one of the most awesome books ever printed. RIFTS was by far the coolest game I had ever come across and it blew my mind. I played this game like a fiend.<br/><br/>1989<br/>My life long GM Sam Hyde god sick with leukemia and died that year. He was like a brother to me and I really loved him. I inherited all of his D&amp;D miniatures (two full cases) all his book (multiple copies of almost everything TSR put out) and his dice. For a while I was lost.<br/>I played games and got hipped to Runequest, Twilight 2000, Traveler, Shadowrun, FASA Star Trek, Battletech, and Rolemaster\u2019s Cyberpunk game.  This was also the year I tried my hand at really writing an RPG. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy RPG\u2026it sucked ass<br/><br/>1990-93<br/>these were the years where things got really cool in my gaming life. I found a whole slew of new games that opened my eyes to a new world of possibilities. This was the year I found some of my truest loves in gaming; DC Heroes, Torg,  Dark Conspiracy, Cyberpunk 2013, GURPS, and Vampire the masquerade. Of the ones mentioned DC Heroes did the trick for me. I had played in a lot of super games but none gave me what I wanted until then. DC Heroes flipped the scripted on how I thought about games.<br/><br/>1993-96<br/>I played a lot of games during this period and was in a regular LARP game where I met my second wife (The 1st one I met during a Cyberpunk2020 game...i should have known I\u2019d get screwed).  I played a lot of Vampire, Mage, Nephilim, Mekton, Streetfighter, Champions, Over the Edge, Pendragon, and GURPS. Cyberpunk and later Cybergenerations were two mainstays during this time.<br/>I played only two CCGs  in my life Shadow Fist and Illuminati.<br/> A lesser known RTalsorian game, Dreampark, helped me with game design during this period. My roommate at the time was great because he was just as enthusiastic about comics and RPGs as I was and we vibed off of one another a lot. We pushed each other to run the best games and got a lot out of one another\u2019s company. During this time I started working on what would become GODSEND Agenda.<br/><br/>1997-2001<br/>Played a lot of LARPS, Hercules &amp; Xena, Feng Shui, Jovian Chronicles,  Legends of the Five Rings, Fading Suns and a TON of In Nomine. SJ game\u2019s In Nomine is my second favorite RPG ever. I loved this game and played the heck out of it. All my friends were playing Armageddon at the time but I couldn\u2019t stop playing In Nomine. This game consumed me for quite a few years.<br/><br/>2001<br/>I start to write GODSEND Agenda this year and play it and loads of Exalted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.

I was enlightened by a ton of games like Sorcerer, Little Fears, Star Children, Children of the Sun, Dark Continent, Seventh Seal,  Legends Walk, Kult, Nobilis, Underworld, and a lot of others I\u2019m forgetting. Oh yeah, my game came out this year but went unnoticed since 3 other supers games came out that year. Hero5, Mutants and Masterminds, Silver Age Sentinels, and Godlike\u2026who knew. For years there wasn\u2019t a supers game in site and in the same year we all hit...or at least they did.  I was the red headed stepchild<br/>A lot of smaller games got washed away when D20 hit and sadly only a few games survived the deluge. That year I met a lot of people I consider friends to this day.<br/><br/>As a side note: <br/>When I got into publishing games a lot of people blew me off because they had their cool money making D20 product. Ron Edwards, Andy Kitowski, Mark Simmons, David Salisbury, Lewis Pollak, and Gareth Skarka treated me like a human being. They had no reason to beyond maybe simple human decency but I really appreciate it.<br/><br/>2003-2006<br/>A lot of people have said that the gaming industry is dying but I don\u2019t see it. I\u2019ve played lots of new games and managed to find new ones each year. I see a lot of games out there that push the boundaries of what we think RPGs are or should be. <br/><br/>2007<br/>Last Gencon I brought home a ton of new games that I have yet to play but are proud to won. Steal Away Jordan, Reign, Jihad, Blossoms are Falling, Heroes Banner,  Spirit of the Century, The future looks incredibly bright to me and I have no worries that I will be playing RPGs until I\u2019m wearing diapers. I consider this hobby an activity and an artform.<br/><br/><br/>I look back at this list and I know I will be adding something here and there once I remember                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116741/#Comment_116741" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T00:08:15+00:00" title="December 28, 2007 12:08AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dang dude, that's pretty extensive!
