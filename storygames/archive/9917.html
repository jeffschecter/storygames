So you might announce that Kron is going to confront the Chieftan and the scene framer might say "Ok, you're in the great hall and you've diplomatically put your case, but the Chief is shaking his head. You see your rival behind the throne smirk.

While it is found in GMed games, I've also seen it in GMless games where everybody is playing round-robin "kick each other in the story junk."  It is a technique supremely useful in getting conflict-averse players to address the game's theme or to produce intense, fast-paced narrativist play.  For folks who aren't conflict shy and aren't after breathless bandolier-o-bangs play (or trying to cram everything into a con game time slot), it's not especially useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220432/#Comment_220432" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T16:26:20+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  4:26PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I call it the Law &amp; Order technique: BAWM BAWM, you're right there talking to the victim's wife, no stopping for coffee or checking voicemail.<br/><br/>I think it takes a lot of agreement between GM and players, so it feels like fast-forwarding to the good parts, but not <i>through </i> the good parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220446/#Comment_220446" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T17:04:21+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  5:04PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also gives up on some emergent premise for pre-thought premise, or at least, removes some options for emergent premise...<br/><br/>If the PCs don't talk at the coffee-break about their relations with NPCs, or what they viewed on TV, then there are options lost.

'Have meaning' is not semantically similar to 'tall' -- it's not a relative state. Things have meaning or do not, they do not have more or less meaning, and surrounding them with other things that have meaning does not make them less meaningful. Take for example this sentence, and all the previous ones, in which there is meaning everywhere -- does the fact that all these words and phrases mean something make it impossible for you to understand my post?<br/><br/>But maybe you are thinking more about a certain kind of mood or level of intensity?

A lot of <i>in media res</i> stuff, skipping any introductory/preparatory elements and just going for some serious (intense) situation where everyone has to hit the ground running.<br/><br/>I also don't like it as an exclusive diet: a few scenes like this can be fun, a whole game full of them is not.

There's situation, and players talk about what they're doing. Occasionally, the GM (let's assume there is one for "a lot of games") might advance a sort of story agenda and frame a scene but there's some pressure to make that scene be about what the players are having their characters do. It's not always good cricket to jump ahead or discount the current character situation.<br/><br/>When you frame a scene, you have the option to change the situation. As I explained above, in a lot of games, this isn't cool (not that you'll find any mention of its uncoolness in the rules, but gamers seem to know it isn't cool). But realize that a lot of play doesn't even happen in formal scenes, with clear starts and ends like you'd expect from a movie director.<br/><br/>In games with scene framing, someone in a GM role is framing scenes for play, often setting up a new situation, often skipping around in fictional time and place, and often putting pressure on the protagonists. In games with *aggressive* scene framing, as I understand it, there is little or no play "between scenes." Also, the GM role might be putting more pressure on the protagonists, but I am not sure this has to be part of the definition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220682/#Comment_220682" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T21:31:10+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  9:31PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>while this is funny, it sort of seems like "i meta-attack your character"<br/>"roll to... oh, wait, you automatically succeed. Make up whatever damage you want."</blockquote> Interesting: Fiasco has a mechanic that makes you trade framing authority for resolution authority.  You can either choose to establish the scene, leaving your friends to make the resolution hurt, or you can let your friends frame a painful scene, which you'll resolve. So there's a peacekeeping element of mutually assured destruction, or at least there would be if you wanted your character to succeed. In practice, Fiasco seems to thrive on an exclusive diet of characters with miserable, messed-up lives that just get worse every scene, so meta-attacks of that kind don't really matter, as long as they're cool enough.<br/><br/>I just played A Penny For My Thoughts last night, which offers another way to confer meta-attack authority on the other players.  At each branching point in the story, two players other than the scene's narrator offer alternative outcomes, and the rules reward being the author of the outcome that is chosen.  So if Alice asks "What did I say or do then?" and Eve meta-attacks her, Bob might choose to offer a gentler alternative and narratively undercut Eve to get the penny.<br/><br/>All this is a long-winded way of saying that if a game or a group wants aggressive scene framing, the burden is on it/them to provide mechanical support for keeping it fun, or to settle into a style that does the same thing.  A group full of cliff-danglers playing Munchausen won't have fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
