                    This is a little idea I posted in the Audience Participation thread, but maybe that was the wrong place for it.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the community could really use a collaborative tool for sharing actual play reports more effectively. There are quite a few APs that have essentially become classics, and it would be nice if there were a way to share this better.<br/><br/>What I propose is a Web app where people can link to actual play reports, mark rate their favorites, filter, sort, and search according to game, player, or theme, and so on. If we get a decent level of participation, it will give people a way to quickly find and share really good actualy play. Does this sound like a tool anyone would use? Do you have any suggestions what kind of features it would need?                </div>

                            A sufficiently featureful Digg clone sounds like it'd work.<br/><br/>The pain point w.r.t. Actual Play reports is making them, not finding or using them. Are there any tools that could help with that? (Real-time collaborative text editors come to mind, for players to create notes live in play, but they could maybe benefit from a feature that lets you keep a nugget of note-taking invisible to other players until after the game?)                        </div>

                            Thanks Jason, I hadn't seen actualplay.com. They have a lot of the features that you'd need, but it doesn't seem like their library is very comprehensive. <br/><br/>Misuba, Digg looks like it's pretty close to what I envision. I'm starting to wonder if the way to go isn't to build yet another Web app, but to launch an initiative to use existing tools more effectively.                        </div>

                            i hate writing AP reports. I know they are really helpfull, and i love to read them but i really don't like writing them. I would love an aplication that has a bunch of pull downs tabs and a couple of feilds that i could fill in that would generate AP for me. Sort of a formalized AP form. That would be really handy, and i know personally, i would produce a lot more.                        </div>

                            I'm in a similar boat when it comes to doing AP reports.  I like the games I play, and I like doing what I can to support folks who make the awesome games I play, but the process of writing it feels grueling.  That said, I don't think I'd use any sort of AP generator, partly because I can't see how that would make something entertaining to read.<br/><br/>An Digg-type thing for Actual Play could be really sweet.  That I would definitely use.<br/><br/>Another thought I just had is that could help out publishers who link to Actual Play by giving them one place to link to for a potentially growing number of AP reports.                        </div>

                            It would also be great if there were people willing to proactively create links for actual plays they like.<br/><br/>Authoring tools would be useful. I'm not sure I would use them, but I bet some people would. I'm just not sure how they would need to look. Maybe a wizard where you fill in the game system, players, scenes, and so on?                        </div>

                            After writing a number of actual play posts, I have a degree of method to the way <i>I</i> write them. Tony, would you like to see that here? On another topic? Or stick to Web 2.0-ifying.<br/><br/>ActualPlay.com is a great site, but I don't think it's interface is quite up to snuff.

                            I think authoring AP is a bit ideosyncratic.  Everybody has a different point of attack and focus, and every session reported needs different emphasis.  So I guess I'd suggest some formal structure as an option, but not a requirement.                        </div>

<p>What's the vision behind this? I've always viewed APs as essentially either game reviews or dianostic tools to examine what's wrong with a group, and not really things in their own right. That can't be your intent. It seems like you want to make APs a thing that are intended to be read for their own sake?</p>

                            Zak,<br/><br/>I'd love to see how you write APs. I've only written a few myself, and I'm far from an expert.<br/><br/>Shreyas,<br/><br/>The vision is making them easier to find an use for whatever you want to use them for. Diagnostic tools is part of this, and you can't make good use of the tools if you can't find them. <br/><br/>I've noticed that Actual Play is becoming more and more a part of how our group games. Here are some examples from our group:
<ul><li>We swtich systems every month or two. The last switch we had was motivated by an actual play one of the group read. Getting everyone to read the AP was an important part of prep for that game because it encapsulated what the GM loved about Dictionary of Mu.</li>
<li>Many times an issue comes up at the table and someone says "you should see how this was covered in Actual Play x." </li>
<li>When I get ready to run a system, I want to read good APs of it in use. There's </li>
<li>A few APs have become classics of a sort, well worth reading just for fun. "Moose in the City" and "Flaming Taft" come to mind.</li>
</ul>
In our growing use of APs, there are a number of problems that come up again and again. 
<ul>
<li>"Where was that AP again?" No standard place to find an AP that I want to read.</li>
<li>The community collectively knows where some really awesome APs are, but we have no standard way to share that intelligence.</li><li><br/></li><li>There has been much rumbling about making the artifacts of gaming (APs among them) into objects of enjoyment in their own right. For this to happen, those artifacts need to be findable. Otherwise, it's like we're just waiting for the world to randomly stumble across our APs and decide they're art.</li>
<li>Categorization: What if I could suddenly see every AP with Ron Edwards in it? What if I could see Ron Edwards' list of favorite APs?</li>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>As I understand, in Japan there is actually a market for "replays" as products in and of themselves. One of the J-gamers could probably elaborate on what function they fulfill.<br/><br/>Bit of a rant here... I think this hobby would make a lot more sense it it were widely understood that "actual play" is the central thing to celebrate, not writing critical-looking book reviews and not buying glossy wannabe art books and not analysing marketing data and not wanking around on online forums (Hi there!). The whole notion of game as "product" is a perversion.<br/><br/>So, the act of celebration alone is sufficient to me here. That the process also has a number of side benefits like offering data for games creators or helping consumers decide what they'll purchase is just that, side benefits.                        </div>

                            Wow, it sounds like there's some room for collaborative effort here. <br/><br/>Ryan, if you're interested in building a wiki-ish tool for authoring and tagging APs, then I'd definitely be into making an AP linking and rating tool's hip to your tagging scheme.<br/><br/>Radghast, I know nothing of Wikia, but I'm willing to learn.                        </div>

                            Tony, I was thinking more along the lines of a linking/tagging tool than an authoring tool, mainly because I'm not sure what I'd do with an authoring tool (either as a user or as a developer).                        </div>

                            Actual Play sells games to me, but the AP has to be written in such a way as to interest me.  Campaign logs bore me to a barely animate replication of death.  Quote files are only sometimes funny.  I want to hear the neat! stuff, what excited the GM or player.  (For some examples, <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/archive/004019.html#more" rel="nofollow">Doyce</a> "sold me a copy of" <em>InSpectres</em> about five minutes after I read this.  Of course, now I don't quite remember why... [laughs])                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>As I understand, in Japan there is actually a market for "replays" as products in and of themselves. One of the J-gamers could probably elaborate on what function they fulfill.</blockquote>
As I understand it, replays are put into rulebooks as a way to demonstrate how to play the game; some Western games do this, but the ones in Japanese games tend to be longer (at least 3 full pages), and are done in a script format.<br/><br/>Replays have also become a form of entertainment in themselves, as well as a way to show off a new game. Replays are published as doujinshi, in magazines, and even actual books, not to mention put up on websites. The issue of Role&amp;Roll I ordered is chock full of replays, including ones for Meikyuu Kingdom and the new edition of Tunnels &amp; Trolls, both of which just came out in Japan.                        </div>
