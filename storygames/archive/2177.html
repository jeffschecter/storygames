                    So I've got a number of regular gaming groups: D3 and my Bi-Weekly group dwells solely in the realm of one shots and 3-5 shot games. My weekly gaming group which I've had for almost 5 years now waffles between long games and medium games, with one-shots here and there.<br/><br/>In any case, if you know me at all you know I play all over the board, and am just as comfortable (with the right players) in a one-shot punk rock game as I am with a long-term traditional game. I've seen (and given!) TONS of huge advice for running the one to three shot games. What I'd love to see is some solid advice for the long term games. The kind where you play weekly or bi-weekly for months, or a year even. <br/><br/>In this thread, I'm looking to share (and gather) ideas and tips for:<br/><br/>* Things that work in general (focusing on the long term game)<br/>* Setup advice<br/>* Getting player buy-in into the setting and even system<br/>* How to wrap up the game<br/><br/>Here's some random stuff that I have:<br/><br/>A) When setting up the game world, try to get at least each person to invent a major NPC or organization (be it friendly, neutral or antagonist). The GM should keep these guys in the "safety zone" for at least the first half of the campaign, not whacking them and the like until they're gotten good air time.<br/>* On that note, perhaps ala Shock: defer all questions, details etc about a particular NPC or organization to the person who created it.<br/>* Perhaps facilitate the above with a Wiki.  If someone's not comfortable with Wiki, then the GM (or game organizer of some kind) will be responsible for uploading and editing the Wiki for that person.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Try to get the characters together quickly.  This is "Traditional Play" advice.  You can have entire games of Shock or Polaris where the protagonists never meet each other, but I'm aiming advice towards the traditional play with this statement. "You all meet in a bar" is played out, but in the first episode or so, before the curtains go up it would be cool to have at least nascent relationship ideas written down about the other characters.  <br/>* You know how in WW they have the section in each archetype "Gangrel think Tremere are a bunch of power-grabbing incestuous loafers" etc. Write down those sorts of feelings for each character your character knows beforehand, and as they meet the other PCs add your feelings from there. Keep it simple. Coolness happens when those perceptions change over time.<br/>* I've had great success with characters knowing each other in "teams". Mark and Alan's characters know each other, Beth and Jeremie's characters are partners, and soon in this game these two groups will meet.<br/><br/>C) GM: Don't do all the work. We're gamers with jobs. The GM doesn't have the time to create everything. This points back to Item A: The GM should encourage the others to contribute Corpus (as Ben would say), and from there use that when designing scenarios.<br/><br/>D) One long super-scenario, or mini-scenarios strung back-to-back? Some long campaigns (like the CoC ones) have one major goal in mind, or one overarching theme across the entirety of the campaign. That's a great style, and play can be epic, but the GM should be open to new outcomes as the players make unexpected choices. <br/>* Another style is a long campaign using the same characters that's broken up into episodic chunks. These three sessions the PCs raid the Lair of the King-witch. The next four sessions the characters defend Foreground Keep from the Mighty Celestial Dragon. The next session is a one shot where they try to hunt down a person with a bounty on their head. The next session is a three-parter where the timeline advances a year and they fight to keep the power they gained earlier, etc.<br/>** This is a cool style, and you can even incorporate some PTA-style fun in there (get ideas of possible character Issues to bring out in play; use scenes not exclusively, but at least sometimes; etc). However, it's harder to end the campaign with as big of a bang as you could with the Epic scenario, above.  Maybe wrap up the campaign with a multi-session 'dangerous/epic' scenario that pushes things a little harder than previous sessions.<br/>** With this kind of play, you can also switch GMs and run the same campaign. If you do this perhaps create a pool of a few NPCs that regularly interact with the players: When a GM switch occurs, the former GM can make one of those NPCs into a PC.<br/><br/>E) Bring in NPCs (neutrals and antagonists) naturally. Don't kill them off in the same session that they're introduced if you really want them to have some impact. Most good GMs know all the advice about stringing a villain along for many sessions so that it's more satisfying when they are defeated. However, the same should be true for background NPCs and organizations. Keep them in play until all the players remember their names before you start shaking shit up.<br/><br/>Let's hear yours!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Here's one thing I did (accidentally), which worked out amazingly well:<br/><br/>For the first 3-4 sessions of a d&amp;d campaign, my two players played chaotic evil and neutral evil characters - one a blackguard and one an evil cleric. They were vicious, brutal, and a bit crazy.<br/><br/>Then we decided that was enough of THAT, and I had them make up new characters. A ranger, and a warrior. Another player joined us, too. The central nemesises (nemisi?) of these new characters was... you guessed it... the blackguard and evil cleric.<br/><br/>They brought the villains into creation, breathed life into them, lived them... And then they created the heroes who had to stop this growing threat.<br/><br/>It worked out really well.                        </div>

                            Character change early on. I can't think of a character that I wouldn't tweak the hell out of once I saw what I was doing with them. Even if you generate the characters together take a trial run then reset all of them so that every one is as comfortable as possible.<br/><br/>Conservation of NPCs make them come back again and again in the damnest ways. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Tenra Bansho Zero, but IIRC there is a chart that creates NPCs with cool relationships to the characters. Use that, or something like that, to seed cool stuff<br/><br/>Don't try to figure what it's about till you can see what it is about. Do some hand waving at first let some NPCs come back, have some cool relationships emerge then one day you will see it and know what the story is about.                        </div>

Our (two years old, monthly-ish play, DnD 3.5) campaign now completely revolves around the wiki. Of 5 players, 3 have laptops out at the table to refer to everything they need on the wiki (or d20srd.com). Tonight I checked 'Recent Changes' and found 4 new organizations that are totally unrelated to the campaign had just been added by a player. There was only a paragraph or two about each, but with some potential plot hooks. You'd better believe that I'll defer most questions to that player if we incorporate them in play. If not, it's just documented color that the other players can come across and think about and decide whether they're interested in it. Another player writes up session notes, linking to NPC pages and so forth, which for a game that plays as infrequently as ours (we're all busy professionals, most with families) is a lifesaver for everyone. Plus, it gives everyone something to do between sessions when they want a little bit of the buzz. <br/><br/>So: wikis: maybe not for every game group/campaign, but everything got better about ours when we started keeping stuff there. More involvement all around.                        </div>

A way that has worked well for me in the past is mixing the two types up - so have the main bulk of the campaign made up of lots of self-contained mini-stories, taking 1-4 sessions, but overlay a larger, more epic arc that you occasionally dip into for a session or two. Make the conclusion of that arc the conclusion of the entire campaign.                        </div>

                            We have a successful model of rotating GMs.  So I'll rock out for six weeks, then hand off the campaign to Tom, who'll run a few sessions, then hand it to Steve, and so forth.  We have a couple of guys who are strictly players (or who will step up to run an occasional one-shot), but most of the group mixes it up as GMs within the campaign framework we've collectively established.  Right now we're thinking for the next long campaign we'll "time dash" between GMs, so each six-week arc will be separated by a few years of game time.                        </div>

                            Make sure your campaign ends at some point, in a planned fashion, not just because people stop coming or two of the guys move to another town. Let the players know a few sessions in advance, so they have time for emotional wrap-up.                        </div>

                            The most effective long-term games I've played in are those where the players really care about the NPCs.  Centering the game on a common locale that functions as a de facto character is also important.<br/><br/>This thread is especially pertinent since I'm just starting what I hope will be a long-term Ars Magica campaign.  I wanted to go BW, but couldn't sell the players on learning the system.  Plus I'd had extensive experience with AM.  I'd forgotten the amount of backfill the game requires.  Historical setting plus the Hermetic overlay.  We have six players, so I'm planning on collecting their characters' flags and building each one into the setting, tying each one to family and NPCs.  <br/><br/>On a side note, I'm sweating the added crunch in 5e AM.  My experience was with 2e and 3e, and though the rules seem tighter in the current edition, I'm finding a hell of a lot more expansion of complexity in the way the lab rules work and the number of mechanics formulae required to play.  We only have one book and no one other than me has played the game.  Despite a truckload of play aids, generating companions sucked up almost three hours.  Our next session will be tied up in generating magi.  Makes me wish I'd tried to sell them on Heroquest.                        </div>

                            One piece of advice from me is to know your game's growth curve and how to work with it. Nothing sucks worse than realizing that your PCs have WAY too much power or skill for the kind of game you want, and they've had it for several sessions now. Likewise, if you assume that the PCs can handle something they can't, it really shows when you have to fudge to let them win, or when their enemies show mercy for no reason. All my recent experience comes from Exalted, where you can really screw a player over by assuming they have a perfect defense when they don't.<br/><br/>Another thing people find difficult is creating long-running antagonists that don't look utterly and totally invulnerable every time they show up (except the last one, of course). The first time, fine, but it gets <i>really</i> repetitive after that. I prefer having villains that actually gain XP, or using multiple reveals of "I was really working for so-and-so, who you totally can't beat...urk...I'm dead..."<br/><br/>Joe's advice about recurring elements and convergent plot is an excellent one. I highly recommend an "everyone shows up twice" rule.<br/><br/>Finally, nearly every piece of advice can be reversed and the game can still work properly. I had a great Wheel of Time game that started with the eight characters separated into three groups, and stayed that way for about eight games. Admittedly, they were pretty damn happy once everyone was together, but it worked well. They also ranged from level 3 to level 16, and it was never a problem.                        </div>
