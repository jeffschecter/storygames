                    ...And other Game State theorists:<br/><br/>I've been seeing my name here kind of a lot!<br/><br/>If you haven't already, I invite you to check out my current rpg project, <a href="https://lumpley.itch.io/the-wizards-grimoire" rel="nofollow">The Wizard's Grimoire &amp; The Barbarian's Bloody Quest</a>, with more to come.<br/><br/>I think it aligns solidly with your Game State Model, and could provide a useful example for you. The games' structure upends the conventional RPG authority structure in a way that, I think, sheds light on how rpgs can, might, and do privilege non-shared in-game facts and continuity. Among other structural questions, they ask, "how much of the game state needs to be shared in order to create satisfying and meaningful continuity?" and they answer "not that much actually."<br/><br/>I also think you might super hate them. Maybe I'm mistaken and you'll love them! I don't know.<br/><br/>Either way, you might be interested, and there's a free downloadable preview that'll give you the gist, so I invite you to consider them.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-Vincent                </div>

                            Hey <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> darling! Hope you're doing OK!<br/>Thanx for the reco! Just paid for &amp; downloaded the PDFs. (Because I missed that there was a free demo.) I'm in a different time zone (it's 2248 on a Friday night here), just got home from seeing Dracula with <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> who is visiting.<br/><br/>I promise to read them through and give my Brutal Review™ <small><abbr title="Let me know">lmk</abbr> if you <i>don't</i> want that and instead want a completely all-positive Pep Talk™—I usually ask this <i>before</i> I even start reading</small> but I'll tell you what I <i>do</i> like and that's this post! Glad af to see you taking The Model seriously! Before I understood that Jeph &amp; Thanuir and some others were onboard I was feeling super gaslighted, like, am <i>I</i> being the crazy one here? etc etc blablabla you get it, I'm sure.♥<br/><br/>Peeps were referring to your 15 year old posts as if they were carved into granite. <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/><br/> </div>

                            Have now read it except the actual “do not read this yet” part (gonna hold off on that until I have two other dorx nearby so we can actually play it b/c it loox fun).<br/><br/>OK, so it’s obv just a dinky li’l toy game compared to the extravagant didn’t-know-where-to-stop-piling-things-on kitchen sink that is 2097e, <em>but</em>,<br/><br/><strong>that’s what makes it a perfect example</strong> to demonstrate the whole game state thing.<br/><br/>And from that perspective, it doesn’t have the “pretend symmetry” quality though.
<blockquote class="Quote">I’ll ask things like “I’m set upon by raiders. What are they like?” You and your fellow volunteer can imagine any raiders you want, exactly the raiders you find most fun, and tell me about them together.</blockquote>I.o.w. they’re just pulling them out of their hats &amp; making them up. That kinda gameplay is what I wanted to get away from for the full “mirror story” kick. In the blorb, you’re pretending there’s something in the fridge, I’m pretending there’s something in the fridge, it’s symmetrical. Our <em>knowledge</em> of that thing isn’t symmetrical (if I’ve read ahead in the prep and seen that there’s cake in there) nor is our power but at least we’re even when it comes to this one aspect of play. “Pretend symmetry.”<br/><br/>I get that it’s easy to make good &amp; credible &amp; satisfying raiders on the fly even w/o referencing the Lumps deep cut “Coherence and Contradictions” due to the question process buuut here we have a significant (??? maybe??? not sure since I haven’t played yet) aspect of play that’s relegated to only using tier 3 truths even though it (?? might be???) salient.<br/><br/>Any follow up Qs on that? thanx<br/><br/> </div>

                            1. The game certainly has lots of information known only to single or no player.<br/><br/>2. It is interesting how the cohesiveness, if any, of the game world is the responsibility of the player. I guess that by asking sufficiently loaded questions it could be maintained or some earlier elements could be reincorporated. "I always take my pipe with me when I travel. Do I have it now?" or "Are these raiders the same ones the captured me earlier? Any faces I recognize?".<br/><br/>3. The game would likely be very different when played with mostly the same people several times, when compared with playing with different people all the time.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Lumpley">@Lumpley</a> :<br/><br/>Not sure what writeup is the best but I had been playing &amp; running RPGs for 20 years and then somewhere in 2012, 2013 I found an OSR group (so I was kinda late to the party, grognardia had been up for years at that point) and I played with them once, thought “ok that was kinda fun, but kinda scripted”, went home, looked at the module and thought “huh…. that could’ve gone all kinda <i>different</i> ways, and then played with them again and we find this room.<br/><br/>there’s an object behind a curtain. I walk up to it and put my hand under. feels like glass. “it’s a cursed mirror?” we all think. we take it down from the wall w/o looking at it or removing the curtain. attach it to our cart.<br/><br/>hours later, fighting against toad monsters on our way home from dungeon. we pull away curtain. one toad monsters sees the mirror and goes pop like a soap bubble just disappear from this world. and the mirror cracks.<br/><br/>and i’m like… holy shit. the way the mirror felt so “real” when I first put my hand up against the glass (i.e. said “I put my hand under the curtain what do I feel”), the entire dungeon started feeling real, cold under my feet, I just vertiginously fell into it.<br/><br/>i called my mom later that night i think i woke her. i was like “I <i>finally</i> understood how roleplaying games work!”<br/><br/>remember, I had played games for <b>two decades</b> but I had never read moldvay or L4 The Lost City or any classic module. I was used to <i>two</i> kinds of gaming: improvised, and railroaded-events (or a mix). The idea of prepping a <i>location</i>, a porte-monstre-trésor (place/problem/goal array) had never ever ever occured to me in my whole life. it was all robin’s laws or funnel CoC setups (I hadn’t read that haunted house intro adventure either) or giovanni chronicles or whatever. and above all…. IMPROVISED stuff. “let’s play a roleplaying game? we don’t have rules. let’s start with some neil young song lyrics etc and just improvise from that, you’re the Archer etc, we just landed on the sun in our silver seed” etc etc. i mean we had done all kindsa weird &amp; awesome shit. we had done the whole 90s scandinavian shit with extreme immersion, candle-lit, never ever speaking ooc. we had done a bunch of larps. we had had vampire larps in ruined castles from the 1200s etc. we had everway, we had fudge, we had diaspora, we had gurps, we had fiasco, we had it all except this. i had read 200 games.<br/><br/>I mean, the “mirror story” is D&amp;D basics but it just never occurred to me. and it was <i>the best</i>. just the best. and it happens pretty much every session now, it’s been a repeatable kick. i’m like… FINALLY. some of the games that came closest were Rune, Three Sixteen and Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>i’ve been kind of a champ for a very strict take on this playstyle since that happened six or so years ago. Much more strict &amp; disciplined about it than even the DM of the game where the “mirror story” happened.<br/><br/>I at first thought that the stocking algorithm or whatever was the secret ingredient but the DM can be much freer than that.<br/><br/>the principles I use right now are are…
<h2 id="prepping-running">Prepping ≠ Running</h2>The “prepper” and “runner” is two completely different mindsets. If you are doing homebrew you need to really really try to switch mindset before running that material. I <em>love</em> running stuff that other people have written for this reason.
<h2 id="the-three-tiers-of-truth.">The three tiers of truth.</h2><ol><li>Is there an answer in the prep? (I.e. what does the prep say is in that treasure chest?). Iff undefined, fall down to tier two:</li><li>Is there an answer in the rules? (I.e. do you have a random treasure chest content table?) Iff undefined, fall down to tier three:</li><li>Make it up. (Prefer boring/empty/nothing.) Forgive yourself, but try to patch the hole for future sessions by creating a new rule, table, or be better at creating specific content.</li></ol><h2 id="the-wallpaper-saliency-principle">The wallpaper saliency principle</h2>If something is mere “wallpaper”, feel free to improvise it. If it becomes salient by other rules interacting with it, it doesn’t count as mere wallpaper any more.<br/><br/>A recent example from my game is that because of spellcomponents, it became salient how much spell-active moss you can find in a day while foraging in the forest, so I created rules for that. (For new campaigns remove or store some of these rules that have become irrelevant. You can dig ’em out again if they come up.) I’m sure this is how GURPS grew to become so horrifically unweildy. But we started small with the li’l dinky 32 page 5e starter set booklet. And now several shelves are part of our gamestate.
<h2 id="no-paper-after-seeing-rock-principle">No Paper after seeing Rock principle</h2>This is to solve the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22113/when-i-was-lost-and-cried-out-for-blorb-and-couldnt-find-blorb/p1" rel="nofollow">“chasm width”–problem</a>. Don’t create prep after seeing the characters. Here on S-G, this has been our current design focus, to replace this principle with some more nuanced principles; to find a way that’s sufficiently decision-making-disclaimed that we can have <em>some</em> character-custom elements in the prep. Like you roll up an aunt on the lifepaths in <abbr title="Xanathar's Guide to Everything, one of the 5e core books">XGE</abbr>, it’d be cool if that aunt then was actually in the game, wouldn’t it? etc etc.<br/><br/>In my mind, all four of these principles are kinda clumsy &amp; raw &amp; could use some more nuanced &amp; elegant design. Otoh they are super robust.<br/><br/> </div>

                            I really like how there's all this room to explore pre-written material in these games, Vincent! I've played <i>In Dreaming Avalon</i> a few times, and people always loved hunting down the ogre (for those unfamiliar, it's a whole more-or-less predefined sequence of events the text guides you through, while leaving you room to describe and embellish).<br/><br/>Jeremy Strandberg is building all kinds of interesting pre-written material into his Dungeon World hack, <i>Stonetop</i>. Check out some great excerpts of the Arcana over here in this thread:<br/><br/><a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-forward-to-stonetop/1253/8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-forward-to-stonetop/1253/8</a><br/><br/>Vincent, do you feel there's any particular theory development/idea/concept which is necessary for this kind of design? Or is it a natural extension/evolution of D&amp;D modules and Choose Your Own Adventure books?                        </div>

                            I’m not at all against that in principle. I’m just trying to mull it over and see what’s new about it. To me, it sounds like good old roleplaying, right? We’ve got modules and books of setting content and scripted material and GM notes and character backstories... that stuff is pretty fundamental to the majority of popular roleplaying, right? And has been since the beginning, and continues to be.<br/><br/>I’m very open to the idea that there’s something new here! It will probably take a clever implementation of it to demonstrate the power of the idea. Perhaps Vincent’s stuff is doing that, right?

Maybe I'm just thick, but I'm still sticking to that. As far as I'm concerned, a section of <i>The Wizard's Grimoire</i> revealed during the game - and not known to any of the participants up to that point - will still have to be accepted into the SIS.<br/><br/>It's true that the text will be in the .pdf one participant will have downloaded and printed out.<br/><br/>It's true that we will have agreed earlier to play the game, so your contribution (i.e. the designer's prep) - technically introduced by whoever reads it out loud - will have a ton of credibility. <br/><br/>It's true that it might introduce 'the unwanted' into the game, i.e. mess with the participants' expectations and desires.<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>But we will still all have to give our assent for it to become true in the SIS, which is key. That's the nature of RPGs as I understand them.<br/><br/>(It's very unlikely, but an entry might break someone's suspension of disbelief, be deeply offensive, display the - hypothetical - French language version text on account of a .pdf-glitch etc. In all these cases, the entry does not become part of the SIS.)<br/><br/>None of this is to say that prep is unimportant or can be changed arbitrarily (even though that might be the case for some RPGs or playstyles). As far as I recall, noone argued that the placement of Blackrazor in <i>White Plume Mountain</i> is irrelevant.<br/><br/>We can debate the words 'RPG', 'true' etc., but so far, numerous threads, one with almost 700 posts, have not brought closure (though many insights as well as improvements to some proposed concepts).                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:<br/><br/>Hidden movement board games (such as Specter Ops, Fury of Dracula and the like) being another pretty clear example of off-screen game state. (Shout out to a fan, Ting, for sending me an example of something similar [a tabletop RPG about the Predator and their invisible movement] via email.)<br/><br/>Good old roleplaying?<br/><br/>Things don't have to be <i>new</i> to be a counter-example to <small>(apparently popular interpretation of)</small> Forge stuff. You and Jay have been saying some kinda out there things… I'm much appreciative of how <a href="/forums/profile/Lumpley">@Lumpley</a> is trying to be clear &amp; explicit but I mean what specifically do you need him to say at this point?<br/><br/>What exactly do you (and Jay and Johann) need to hear before you can succumb to me as your queen and mow my lawn in penance?<br/><br/>Good old roleplaying? So that's the tune now?<br/><br/>Three seconds ago you were saying things like I was misrepresenting roleplaying as an activity or saying some pretty hypersollipsistic things like:
<blockquote class="Quote">Whenever and wherever any fact or piece of information is given legitimacy by the players interacting with that fact, it enters their Shared Imagined Space. You say "look, a pink elephant over there!", I accept your statement and imagine it, too, saying, "ooh!", and now we've created a SIS, which has a pink elephant. Credibility and assent.<br/><br/>In a group playing a roleplaying game, all the facts or statements that are given credibility by all the participants are part of the group's SIS, and that's what we use to play: that becomes our game's "board" and "pieces". </blockquote>
And now VB is holding up some other pretty vital "boards"&amp;"pieces" and you're like "oh well I've been down with that old stuff since the Warlock of Firetop Mountain or w/e" and well, you have. Many games work that way. Which is point.<br/><br/>Even <i>now</i> Johann is saying:
<blockquote class="Quote"><blockquote class="Quote">It's a game that demonstrates the difference between the game state and the communicated, agreed-upon SIS, that's all. In case anyone's still sticking to "in rpgs, its not true until everyone agrees that it's true."</blockquote>

The SIS, the <code>shared-p</code> subset of the imagined space, isn't the be-all and end-all of "the nature of RPGs". Which, at this point, has turned into empty semantics. C.f. "the Yahtzee principle" for even more weirdo take on "the nature of RPGs" which apparently can mean nothing and anything…?
<blockquote class="Quote">It's very unlikely, but an entry might break someone's suspension of disbelief, be deeply offensive, display the - hypothetical - French language version text on account of a .pdf-glitch etc. In all these cases, the entry does not become part of the SIS.</blockquote>
Again, the game state can contain contradictions just as the <code>shared-p</code> subset of it can contain contradictions; for both, contradictions can be resolved if they are discovered.<br/><br/>I'm dying by gaslight over here                        </div>

                            What is it that makes the Lonely Fun aspect of some games meaningful? Why roll up D&amp;D characters when we can just imagine a fictional person in any sort of context, not bound by the sometimes arcane rules of an elfgame?<br/><br/>Whatever value there is in the perspectives and boundaries presented by The Game when we're doing Lonely Fun don't suddenly disappear when other people become involved.<br/><br/>In some sense, weren't efforts to classify significant aspects of games and player preferences (such as the Same Page Tool or whatever it was called) an acknowledgement of this fact? That some games just do some things better. That the prior assumptions a game was built with matter, that it can serve as a valuable interlocutor.<br/><br/>When the post-Forge-indie-dirty-hippo-storygames movement decided to embrace the fact that we were all rational, self-interested (or self-indulgent) actors who knew best what we wanted in our games, that was probably a reasonable response to real problematic tendencies in the greater play and design culture of RPGs. It doesn't make it an altogether enlightened, higher form of gaming though.<br/><br/>I think that the logical end-result of that kind of "rational self-interest" approach to play is that we see the other participants merely as baggage; we put up with them because, as a social activity, their presence and contributions are necessary to get what <i>we</i> want out of gaming, and that's it (note that I'm not accusing anyone of actually being so callous; it's merely an example of what happens when we stop valuing external contributions for their actual content, and only see them for the role they play in the larger model of how the game happens).<br/><br/>But there are all sorts of reasons why we can value external contributions of the game designer or the module writer just like we value the contributions of other players as more than just a means to create what we want to create. For serious Step On Up players, that concreteness contributes to the satisfaction of challenge-based play (no paper after rock). In old school tournament play, everybody needed to play the same module in order to establish a baseline by which to score their play. For the immersionists, understanding that the world operates according to actual rules helps them immerse. For organized play like Shadowrun Missions or something, everybody playing the same module creates a sense of community among the game's fanbase. For someone like me, who's really into procedural rhetoric and analyzing game materials a sort of literature or kinetic art, overwriting the creator's message with my own would defeat the purpose. And so on and so forth.                        </div>

                            Paul, Johann:<br/><br/>More provocative, in lumpley principle terms, than the unknown material in the grimoire, is the relationship between the player and the possibly-changing volunteers session by session wrt continuity. The game constructs a wizard with a continuous identity out of a dense mix of communicated and non-communicated material, despite possibly-contradictory experiences, NOT via the lumpley principle.<br/><br/>Nobody's disputing that in rpgs, the moment of communication is a moment of communication. The lumpley principle stands, there. Of course it does! The question is, <i>what else</i>? Where else do we need to be looking?<br/><br/>We can consider rpgs only from the point of view of the act of communication, only from the point of view of the lumpley principle, if we want to. But The Wizard's Grimoire, and many other games to greater or lesser extent, as Sandra's saying, show that this is a pauce view. We should expand our view and consider more.                        </div>

                            One of the things that Wizard's Grimoire highlights effectively is that the concept of SIS is overly vague and unspecific.<br/><br/>In linguistics, it's impossible to talk about common ground or mutual knowledge or manifest information without being clear about <i>who</i> holds this ground in common.<br/><br/>In Wizard's Grimoire, the <i>who</i> is likely changing session to session, outside of the wizard's player.<br/><br/>But this is true moment-to-moment in any other RPG, as well. Sometimes the GM and player are writing notes back and forth. Or one player's in the kitchen or bathroom when someone else makes a contribution. And all the time, our fallible human memories are working hard to cloud our understanding of what's been contributed in the past &amp; who was there to witness it.<br/><br/>And all of these are valid targets for design. I can totally write rules like:<br/><br/><code>"Write down your character's True Name. You can hide it, share it, or lie about it, as you wish. When anyone speaks your True Name and makes a demand of you, you must consent or hand them one Effort Token. Of course, you may consent if you like, even if they get your True Name wrong, to hide the fact. You may even give them an Effort Token when they get your True Name wrong, to maintain a ruse. You probably want to have these conversations in private, to prevent your True Name from spreading around too widely."</code><br/><br/>Suddenly, all these different shared spaces become very, very important!                        </div>

                            Here's my take on what's new about this, for Paul and anyone else who's now changed their view to "yeah but isn't this how it's been?"<br/><br/>You may recall that 15 years ago when I was first writing about the moment of communication, the established model was that the truth of the game was in the GM's sole head. The GM was the author and arbiter of the true game state; everybody else was just imagining, guessing, making things up, waiting and hoping for the GM's affirmation. That's the model that the lumpley principle hates and defies.<br/><br/>This new model DEFINITELY ISN'T a return to that old one. Jeph's example makes that clear.<br/><br/>Another breathtaking early example was in Julia Bond Ellingboe's game Steal Away Jordan, where the GM has to leave the room while the players finish making their characters together.                        </div>

                            I think the current definition of gamestate (SIS plus various other stuff) is fine and it's long overdue that I say so. I disagree with certain claims about gamestate and that's when I have been suggesting alternative definitions to which you rightly take exception. I shall try to avoid this.<br/><br/>I think I am touchy/protective about the concept of the SIS because (1) it's central to roleplaying and (2) <b>it's in my head</b> (as well as those of the other participants). So any wording (inadvertently, I assume) suggesting that someone can 'write' stuff into my head without my consent or knowledge causes vigorous resistance or disbelief, respectively.<br/><br/>(I'll reiterate that I think it is impossible for me to give consent a priori even if I wanted to.)<br/><br/>(You can 'write' stuff into my head, though, for instance by 'spoiling' a movie.) <br/><br/>I don't have objections to a ton of other stuff and am somewhat puzzled that you guys think I do. <br/><br/>I do appreciate you guys... <br/><br/>- championing a playstyle/agenda/whatnot that puts an emphasis on prep unprecedented in explicitness and degree<br/>- analysing and eloquently formulating possible key concepts (e.g. the Three Tiers of Truth)<br/>- developing new techniques to facilitate this playstyle (e.g. auditing the GM prep)<br/>- showing your passion and excitment at breaking new ground<br/>- expanding the design space.<br/><br/>Best wishes &amp; apologies for addressing only a fraction of your points,  <br/><br/>Johann                        </div>

                            I like that LARP example. I'm hesitant to drag komradebob into these conversations since he hasn't been appearing in them himself so I won't actually tag him, but I feel like there's an aspect of that in what he wants to do with minis play.<br/><br/>He (maybe) doesn't want the miniatures to be simple representations of what's going on in the fiction. Instead they're almost like simulacra; not a copy of something real (or imaginary, as it were), but true in their own right through the fact of their existence.                        </div>

That's not a LARP, that's a crime scene. ;-)<br/><br/>More seriously: That's an interesting example. And it is indeed possible in a LARP (which ends for me if and when I find out about this, but I still cannot undo my participation).<br/><br/>But you cannot throw a live cobra into the SIS. You can propose a cobra, and I can't help it but think about snakes for a moment, but I still have to give my consent for it to become part of the SIS.<br/><br/>But to get away from negative examples: I know that hidden or partially hidden information can be used to facilitate all sorts of fun, challenging, intriguing, hilarious, 'solid feeling' etc. experiences in play. Like Paul, I think this isn't really news, though of course it's useful to have a proper theoretical framework of how this stuff works -- leading to an expanded design space (and not just for the klockwerk playstyle). <br/><br/>I once deliberately ran a <i>Shadow World</i> dungeon without having read it in advance: "You trigger a pit trap and fall, uh, 100'. [reads on] Oh, and it says here you fall on spikes. Oh, wow! Poisoned spikes! And, let's see, there's more: The stone plate covering the pit weighs 1 ton and is designed to fall into the pit after you. And the ceiling above the pit ... [turns page] ... opens to release 10 tons of sand into the pit." We were in stitches.<br/><br/>I value such conceits, and definitely not just for humorous purposes. These threads have provided numerous awesome examples.
<blockquote class="Quote">More provocative, in lumpley principle terms, than the unknown material in the grimoire, is the relationship between the player and the possibly-changing volunteers session by session wrt continuity.

I've downloaded the free demo but I don't understand what you're saying. It sure does sound intriguing.                        </div>

                            Johann,<br/><br/>The piece you’re missing is that there is a continuous quest/story that can be facilitated by different players each time. It’s the equivalent of switching over the GM every now and then, while keeping the same “module”. Pretty cool stuff!                        </div>

I failed to see anything in <a href="/forums/profile/Johann%27s">@Johann's</a> post that he's suggesting pre-authorization of a piece of communication.  If you could quote that you'd be helping my little pea-brain out.<br/><br/>However on the other side just 3 days ago someone posted about "unspeakable" things being done to a character and you very strongly came out against such a communication.
<blockquote>...<b>is not a safe exchange</b>...<br/><br/>Things that have been proposed but rejected have at times still been just as triggering to me.</blockquote>
I am not making light of anything that causes you great personal distress.  Such distress is real and should be treated with the greatest respect.  I use this example only to demonstrate that you called out a hypothetical communication of play passing judgment on it as unacceptable in very strong terms.  In essence the hypothetical player should have self-censored.  Or lacking the judgement to self-censor effectively the hypothetical player should have sought pre-authorization from the person who could be triggered before communicating his proposal.  <br/><br/>On a completely different level if we are playing a game set in Narnia I would imagine that official in game communication about warp core breeches in the Romulan Neutral zone would also be "pre-censored" or conversely require some sort of pre-authorization to be introduced.<br/><br/>I've purposely not quoted the text because it seemed so upsetting.

                            They're kinda rough but they can turn many "traditional" style games into pure blorb.<br/><br/>I was hoping to [order people smarter than me to] create more nuanced rules that can replace some of this stuff; for example the Paper→Rock could apply to problem-solving abilities but not to "relevancy traits" maybe, but I'm not getting it to work out without it feeling super Disney World.

<a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> <br/><br/>I'll try to start over.<br/><br/>I was not personally triggered by the drug-demon in Johann's example. Johann seemed to read me that way too, so obviously I was writing very unclearly. Hey, my brain worx on pointers and cells instead of Human Language so I might not be the best writer ever…<br/><br/>What I was saying that I've had the experience of someone adding <b>something</b> to the SIS [it wasn't a drug-demon], me flipping out &amp; passing out &amp; fainting or whatever, and them going "OK no never mind that didn't happen" and that not doing a lot to help me. Once I've seen a live cobra on stage it's gonna change how I dance <i>even if the cobra is removed</i>. Of course post therapy I'm going snake dancin all the time but I'm not ableist enough to presume that everyone else I've ever met is gonna be "post-therapy".<br/><br/>So that was the one thing I was saying:<br/><br/>1. Respect lines. That's something you can do at the prep stage just as well as at any stage.<br/><br/>2. The game state can have contradictions and those contradictions can be resolved. "OK so the locked box you've been carrying with you for the last four sessions finally opens on its own one night and in it is… a live cobra!" "DM, I don't want that. Please can we change it."<br/><br/>The fact that the box contents have been listed in the DM prep as "live cobra" for the last month or so makes it maybe 1% more scary, at most, than if the DM improvised the live cobra right then and there? And the situations can be resolved in the same way, i.e. with great difficulty &amp; respecting everyone at the table &amp; with navigating the social contracts etc.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Lumpley">@Lumpley</a> <br/><br/>So I've been thinking lately that the sort of "core" of this "tangibility" that I want, or that I got from the "mirror story", is a sort of "symmetry" where both the player and the DM pretend that the stone floor is a stone floor, the mirror is a mirror etc. Both sides approaching the material with the same respect, it's not one side using ye olde hat-pulling source book. Unlike the previously listed principles, which I've been tryna float for a few years, this new "symmetry" theory is kinda new &amp; maybe won't hold up. It's just an idea at this stage                        </div>

                            Like a reader-writer contract. Hippy and Klokwerk under the same rule : that the degree of respect for the material be the same for all participants.<br/><br/>At least due to the fact that here is a threshold under which play loses structure (requiring extra effort in constructive seriousness to "take the game seriously"). <br/><br/>Under that rule, the power of GM is exceptional and as such must be justified inch by inch, not taken as a whole from tradition.<br/>Doubly so when we're starting to pick players for bad things happening to their characters or imposing gross imagery (symbolic offense going directly through the fictional layer to the social layer).                        </div>

                            Sandra, I'm right there with you! My own mirror story - it's about a magic wand - doesn't match your 4 principles at all, it didn't even have GMs and non-GM players, but it <i>absolutely</i> depended upon an intense and fully-symmetrical shared commitment to treating our imaginary world as real.                        </div>

That mutual commitment to treating the imaginary as real (which, itself, can exist at different levels and different intensities) is a really key aspect of this whole enterprise.<br/><br/>It’s less clear to me what happens when the commitment isn’t entirely mutual (e.g. the players are convinced it’s “real”, but the GM is consciously creating an illusion, or vice-versa, which also happens), or if the methods used are potentially mixed or conflicting (what if a GM is committed to treating things as real, but doesn’t use “blorby” techniques, for instance - for example, a module which includes some questionable techniques?).<br/><br/>My impression/guess is that this might be the case often (or at least easily) with this new game Vincent has made, due to the (potential) lower commitment of the volunteer players. Has that been your experience at all, Vincent?                        </div>

                            Paul, I don't follow your question. You say "that [this] might be the case" and I can't parse what [this] refers to. "Has [that] been your experience" and I can't parse what [that] you mean. Ask again more explicitly?<br/><br/>But I mean, in The Wizard's Grimoire, the volunteers have to come to agree with each other about every single thing they contribute, which they can only do by discussing it in the open in front of the player. "Hey, what do you think about there being a cake in the fridge? Or no what if there's a pair of pliers in there! That's funny, yeah? Yeah!" Their creative process is always extemporaneous, never particularly committed to anything, there's no possibility otherwise, and there's not even a screen for them to talk behind so the player can politely pretend otherwise.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>

                            That’s a good clarification, thanks.<br/><br/>The “this” and “that” in my question is about a differing level of commitment to treating the fiction as “real” among the participants. How does that dynamic play out in your game? It seems to me that the different participants have different incentives to be invested in the game (kind of like GMs and players do in traditional RPGs).                        </div>

                            Oh, you can't even tell. There's no way to judge anybody's level of commitment to treating imaginary things as real and no reason to try to judge.

But that's why we have transparency of method though? Game design to make it more clear to the players what comes from a module, what comes from a random table etc. Which wouldn't be needed if the 90s had never happened.                        </div>

                            Okay so the story is that Meguey Baker, Emily Care Boss and I had been playing Ars Magica together for a decade or so, in various groups with various other people, and now the three of us undertook to play a radically co-GMed, live-negotiated, freeform version. Our principles going into it were (a) everybody's fully committed to treating the imaginary stuff as real, in every way possible, and (b) nobody's entitled to dismiss anyone else's vision of the imaginary stuff. Challenge, yes, when necessary; dismiss, never.<br/><br/>This would have been, I dunno, 2003, 2004, something like that.<br/><br/>Our wizards had come into possession of a small collection of magical items. Meg, Emily and I brainstormed or otherwise generated a list of them, with no more information per item than "an embroidered shirt" or "a polished copper bowl." One of the items was a bone wand. We'd established that they'd come from the storehouse of a wizards' tower abandoned by its wizards, or something like that, and that's all we knew.<br/><br/>My wizard undertook to figure out what the bone wand was.<br/><br/>We had nothing prepped, we all knew that there was nothing prepped. No tier 1. We didn't have a ruleset for this, beyond me saying what my wizard did and Meg and Emily telling me what happened. Any one of us could have decided and pronounced what the wand was, but nobody wanted to, we wanted to wait and see what my wizard could find out about it. No tier 2. We had a strong, shared working understanding of the constraints and structure of Ars Magica's complicated fictional magic system, so this would form the basis of our tier 3 improvisation.<br/><br/>So here's my wizard, wandering around, waving this wand at things, working through the possibilities implicit in Ars Magica's in-fiction magic system. Meg and Emily are answering my wizard's actions whimsically at first, within those same bounds, then naturally starting to build organically on their collective previous answers.<br/><br/>What happened in the real world was, at the same moment, with no communication between us, Meg's, Emily's and my imaginations converged on the same solution to the pattern they'd been whimsically / intuitively / symbolically / aesthetically creating.<br/><br/>What it felt like was, the wand was real, and we all realized at the same moment what it really was.<br/><br/>I mean, this was what we'd committed to, we were working together to make it happen. Going forward from that point, we trusted it more, and the more we trusted it the more it happened, and the more it happened the more we trusted it. Everything in that game felt really really real.                        </div>

Well, you're right, of course, technically speaking, but there are lots of tells. (And an easy one is just to say so out loud, as Sandra alludes! "Hey, this isn't real, so let's just change what the mirror does!" -&gt; That's a pretty clear statement of where a player stands on the issue, for a simple example.)<br/><br/>I'm thinking it might particularly come into play when players switch over from session to session (or whatever interval of play/time), and show itself that way. (How is the second group of volunteers' approach different from the first, for instance?)
<blockquote class="Quote"> <br/>Why did you put the quotes around real in "treating the fiction as 'real' "?</blockquote>
I probably shouldn't have! It was my way of marking that we've been using the word "real" to refer to a million different things, but I was using it rather loosely here. (It's not hiding some deep-semiotic meaning or anything! You're right that my statement reads more clearly without the scare quotes.)
<blockquote class="Quote">Because he was biting my head off earlier when I was treating the fiction as real, calling me delusional</blockquote>
Hey, now! No need for that.<br/><br/>"Treating the fiction as real" = great! "This fictional thing is actually real" = delusional.<br/><br/>I just wanted to make sure no one was saying the latter. No one was, so we're all good now.<br/> </div>

<i>(OK, so you had radical transparency of method, which, great)</i><br/><br/>So if that wand could feel real: what is it that makes it things sometimes feel <span style="text-decoration: underline;">un</span>real?

So what is the secret ingredient to this realness, this tangibility? Is it the symmetry?

I had the wrong impression because I thought you had a grimoire that you treated as real. I didn't read it yet because I want to try the game                        </div>

Great story! And this experience is very familiar to me. Love it when that happens. And, yes, it's entirely and completely anti-blorb, but not necessarily <i>incompatible with</i> blorb.<br/><br/>In a way, it can happen with different distributions of authority, too. Like if a player (in a traditional setup) suddenly feels that things just HAVE to be a certain way, because it's so intuitively right, and the GM and the group accede/agree/start to see it the same way.<br/><br/>I remember someone's story about a Middle Earth game where a hero wanted to fight a Balrog. There was a sudden and intuitive understanding that, hey, you can do it, sure, but you don't get to do that without sacrificing your life in the process. Since that felt so *right* in the context of Middle Earth, there was instant agreement at the table from all sides: yes, this is how it is.<br/> </div>

                            I read somewhere once in a context where it was persuasive that the word "real" is often used in a relative way, to reflect that a thing is somehow more authentic, genuine, or essential than similar other things. "Do we have real fake cream?" "No, only the powder." Thus, calling something "real" is often a normative move or an act of judgment on the part of tbe speaker. With respect to roleplaying, notions of authenticity are often bound up in judgments about the right relationship between in-character and out-of-character knowledge, even though in most cases the extent to which a player is bringing OOC concerns into play is invisible to other players. Similarly,  the extent to which the GM's inventions are improvised versus "prepped" is often difficult to discern. And in fact, learning that a certain detail was improvised has been said to be occasionally disappointing,  at least to some players, perhaps because that detail is thus then somehow less "real" than it was before.<br/><br/>On the other hand, knowing the "realness" of a particular fictional detail can be used as a guide to how to engage with it on a metacommunicative level, although I'd argue that that's bad practice or at least a missed opportunity.                         </div>

                            I’ll stand by my previous assertion from another thread. It’s not that there are things off-screen. It’s that off-screen things necessarily include relationships (or the characters are fictionally positioned in relation to them).<br/><br/>If me and my buddies spend an hour discussing the mystery and trying to solve it, but the GM is just sat there grinning, secretly taking our ideas as his own, then we’re not ‘really’ solving a mystery, we’re pretending to solve a mystery.<br/><br/>It’s not that the mirror is ‘real’ because it’s prepared. It’s that our choice to drag the mirror around is ‘play pretend’ if the GM can just decide what the mirror does. It renders our decision inconsequential.<br/><br/>If those are the kind of decisions we care about anyway.                         </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">It’s not that the mirror is ‘real’ because it’s prepared. It’s that our choice to drag the mirror around is ‘play pretend’ if the GM can just decide what the mirror does. It renders our decision inconsequential.</blockquote>
If the characters had truly zero information about the nature of the magic of the mirror (including if it had any magic at all), IOW you had no information on which to base your decision to "drag the mirror around", how does the time at which certain traits about the mirror are created render your decision inconsequential?<br/><br/>Say that the mirror had only 2 relationships that were established ahead of time between said mirror and the rest of Setting.  The first that the mirror was mounted on a wall in such a way that it could be easily moved.  The second was that the mirror was covered with an opaque cloth.<br/><br/>In this hypothetical case, your decision was based on no information about the nature of the mirror to begin with, was it not?  What part of your reasoning was invalidated?  Say the powers of mirror were settled upon like in Vincent's current game with two players discussing the possibilities in front of you before settling on the powers, how does that invalidate or make it inconsequential?  Since we know nothing about the mirror and thus nothing about the consequences of taking it or deciding to try and use it (despite having no information to suggest it is more than just a vanilla mirror) what part of the choice to take it is rendered inconsequential?<br/><br/>I'm trying to sort the chain of logic, if you will.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">That H→D, too, is an invalidation of the players choices might not be obvious, but here's the reasoning. Even if H→D makes the fight against the bulliwugs 20% cooler and even if it rewards the party for a cool idea, it makes their behaviour when they first encountered the mirror a bit meaningless. They chose to treat the mirror as dangerous and they invested dearly in that. By doing that, they took the risk that it might've been unnecessary (or even counter-productive, if there was some info there in the mirror). The mirror scene had a tension because they risked failure. By removing that failure, the players behavior was invalidated. </blockquote> </div>

                            My royal road to Sandra's theory was to treat the "facts" of prep (including off-screen stuff) as "rules" with the same weight and reality as the other rules in a game. This had interesting knock on effects, like "utterances create new rules" and "when two facts/rules interact with each other, the result is handled by a third rule, including rules generated as a result of this need." That "there is a pie in the fridge" and "when you trigger Go Aggro, roll +Hard" end up being the same thing in terms of how the game state interacts with them.<br/><br/>This isn't the Sandra endorsed position, just my way into becoming a disciple. As I said elsewhere, if this Golden Path doesn't work, find your own Leto <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Most of Sandra's procedures lock down the game state so that subjective content can't be entered into the game except where it has no interaction with any other fact/rule. The principle of saliency (where wallpaper becomes salient) is another way of stating this.<br/><br/>I believe with Sandra that this changes the game experience quite a bit, and I at least have some idea of which I speak thanks to my two encounters with her game as a player. I have one example, it's a minor one but it kinda showed how I changed the way I played because of the principles of her game. <br/><br/>At one point, it became important to know how much my character weighed. This <i>couldn't</i> be wallpaper, because the reason it was important was that it interacted with a rule about how hard it was to jump a space.* So I had to follow the fact/rule generation procedures. In AW, I'd have been okay with declaring, "Birdsong's a pretty tall and husky gal, so she probably weighs on the high side of 12 stone." And that's okay; that's one of the procedures we use in AW.** But in 2097e that wasn't an option in this case (because of the above-mentioned saliency), so I asked how to randomly generate my character's weight; we looked it up, and I had my answer.<br/><br/>This felt natural to me in the circumstances. There was also...a certain amount of discovery*** of my character that wrapped into the process; I hadn't known this detail about my PC, so now I did. (That the weight I rolled was unexceptional isn't the point, of course.) It certainly created a strong sense of verisimilitude: okay, Birdsong weighs this much, there's no way she's strong enough to do this activity easily, we need to take steps to make sure she doesn't fall to her death****. <br/><br/>Theoretically, I could get the same feeling from AW; "Okay, Birdsong, you're big and husky so I need you to Act Under Fire to climb through the tank hatch because you're a bigger target for longer." I don't think it's a question of individual examples; I think it's a question of the sheer accumulation of detail and a world that clicks on whether the PCs interact with it or not, just as if (as I said elsewhere) even if nobody in the AW campaign ever Opened Their Mind, the Psychic Maelstrom would still exist and that move would always remain a potential. It's easy to see that would be true (just like the Grappling rules of your given game of choice still exist even if nobody would touch them with a used 10' pole.) My way in to Sandra's POV was realizing that the exact same thing was true of "Room 22 has goblins in it." Uh, that and the <i>procedures for generating new facts/rules <b>matter</b></i> and can indeed affect the subjective experience of exploring them. Just like the subjective experience of playing/listening to jazz is different from playing/listening to classical music, which is an analogy I might discuss were this post not way to bloody long already <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>* Actually it might not have been jumping, but it was definitely about traversing a gap over a dangerous fall.<br/>** Note that once "Birdsong is big and husky" has been established by any rules procedure, including AW's "the player makes it up" we can't contradict that later (save by normal error correction rules that Sandra's game has too.)<br/>*** That was kind of a theme for the session for me; I learned a lot about Birdsong, and there was more bleed than usual for me (at least in an adventure-type game). Whether that was because of the way the game worked or other reasons is something I'm sorting out.<br/>**** Well, she was 9th Level so maybe not death, but I have vague memories of wounding tables and other bad things that could happen to her, so no way was I gonna risk it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Appreciate the link and will read it when I get a few minutes.
<blockquote>The anti-blorb is illusionism</blockquote>
This statement invalidates much of Narrativist and Sim game play and design.  Please, enough with the <i>One True Wayism</i>.  I would have thought that Vincent's story of the Bone Wand would have put an end to that kind of thinking.<br/><br/>Yes, you have a wonderful design and set of Techniques that you and your players really like and get really into.  To claim that your particular game system (or game play philosophy) is the only <i>One True Way</i> to play is synecdoche. <br/><br/>The sheer effrontery of arguing the conclusion that all non-blorb play is Illusionism is beyond the pale.  Ugh...<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I understand why you’re feeling frustrated! I can answer your questions, if it would help. Is that something you’d like?<br/><br/>I’ve been avoiding that, because we’d be rehashing the same tired arguments again, and I’m more interested in moving forward. But we can do it if it would help! Just let me know. I could try a summary! (I’m not sure this is the thread for it, though.)<br/><br/>The main reason I’m excited about this thread, by the way, is I kept saying, “hey, cool, models are fun and all, but what’s something we can actually do with this?” - and here we finally have something practical and playable that we can chat about. That makes me happy and excited! That’s where I hoped we’d get to long ago. I’ll always respond more positively to practical application than I will to a theory debate. (For the same reason, I’m trying not to restart the other one again.)                        </div>

                            Just my two cents on the "real" thing.<br/><br/>1. Treating imaginary things as "real" is a fun, healthy activity which is a major part of our hobby.<br/><br/>2. Treating imaginary things as real is an issue that might require medication or hospitalization.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone here is discussing or claiming anything like 2. However, some statements that have been made in some threads could be construed (from a certain POV that holds a particular view of how rules interact with fiction in RPGs) as something that sounds a lot like 2, (despite being meant as 1.)<br/><br/>In those cases, I don't think anybody has accused anyone of 2, only expressed an inability to parse a statement as 1 due to miscommunication, and thus continued to ask for clarification.<br/><br/>Everything in an RPG's fiction is "fake real".<br/><br/>Doubling down on "No! It's real! Not fake-real" just ends up making it <b>sound</b> like you're doubling down on 2.<br/><br/>Some of us live in places where 2 is now common behavior amongst our friends, family, and leaders.<br/><br/>The fact that we now need to take the time to clarify which version of "real" we're discussing is an unfortunate symptom of our times.                         </div>

Oh boy! Are you taking that as a way to discredit all your design efforts? As you know, I love all the things you've been working in, and consider them absolutely fabulous. That's not at all what I meant by that.<br/><br/>What I was trying to say - apparently very poorly, I apologize for that! - was that Vincent's post here was the first actual example of a design someone brought forward to challenge our assumptions in a practical way (in the context of this discussion, I mean), as opposed to just theoretical posturing. That's what I was hoping for all along! That makes me happy.                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I'm referring to the whole philosophical "gamestate" debate, not D&amp;D and blorb play (which are awesome, and I've been doing for, literally, decades). None of my comments here have anything to do with 2097e (which is awesome), or any of the other things you've been posting. I'm sorry, I don't know how to make that any clearer, and I'm sorry I've upset you. <br/><br/>Is it not the case that the whole "gamestate" debate was entirely theoretical until Vincent brought in this example? I might have missed something; I've stayed away from reading the whole ZONKING/VANKING conversation, for instance, so maybe I'm just not up to date. If so, I apologize for that, too!                        </div>

                            Sandra ( <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> ), I know that your model is dear to your heart. You're arguing patiently and passionately and have been very accomodating to boot (e.g. by changing the terminology). This is all to your great credit, as are many other things (e.g. Saliency/Wallpaper principle). But isn't it possible we just disagree on some points without being meanies?
<blockquote class="Quote"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a> If you have some way to require consent for what I'm about to say before I say it (it might or mightn't rhyme with schmive schmobra) you can use that same mechanism to require consent for what I'm about to prep before I prep it.</blockquote>
I'm not quite sure I understand, but <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485994/#Comment_485994" rel="nofollow">I've already explained that I think it's <i>technically</i> impossible to consent a priori here</a>.<br/><br/>It's similar to free will, perhaps: I may philosophically believe there is no free will, but I still have to decide what to do after I finish this sentence. It's impossible for me to <i>not</i> decide on a course of action (or inaction) even if I am convinced my actions are ultimately predetermined. Similarly, it's impossible for something to enter the SIS without my consent/knowledge [edited to add:] <i>in the moment</i>. I can't switch off this feature.<br/><br/>(This is why I'm okay with your definition of gamestate as "SIS plus X" but disagree with the claim that you can change the gamestate (i.e., any part of it, e.g. the SIS) without my consent/knowledge. If I understand things correctly, there is an off-screen canon gamestate (gamestate minus SIS, among other things, right?). I totally get that we can change that and benefit from a deeper understanding of the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i>.)<br/><br/>Also, I can certainly <i>promise</i>, for instance, to accept your GM prep, or everything in Vincent's booklet. For practical purposes, this intent, whether implicit or explicit, will serve us well. <br/><br/>If you know that I know that Vincent has written various edgy games with provocative and potentially offensive content (e.g. <i>kill puppies for satan</i>) and we think we can handle it, we should be fine -- and you or the game can introduce all sorts of off-screen canon which I will then duly accept into the SIS. On the off-chance I object to killing kittens for satan, I can just say "Please, fellow player, don't do that." as you suggest. That's not perfect (as your own trauma story shows) but good enough most of the time.<br/><br/>I'll also disagree with Vincent ( <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> ) , sort of, so you're not being singled out!
<blockquote class="Quote">The GM was the author and arbiter of the true game state; everybody else was just imagining, guessing, making things up, waiting and hoping for the GM's affirmation. That's the model that the lumpley principle hates and defies.</blockquote>
I always took the Lumpley principle as an (important) observation rather than a mission statement, i.e. <b>everyone's agreement has been necessary all along</b>. We just didn't realize it and deferred to the GM.<br/><br/>Almost thirty years ago, I played in an AD&amp;D campaign where a player flat-out refused to accept her character permanently losing 5 points of Intelligence, bringing the game to a screeching halt. I thought she was out of her mind! I couldn't even properly articulate my outrage (though lamentably I tried) in the face of such heresy. <i>Rec.games.frp.advocacy</i> and <i>The Forge</i> opened my eyes and articulate, passionate, and smart people like you, Sandra, and the other posters here on <i>www.story-games.com</i> continue to enrich my hobby and my life.                        </div>

Yeah. I never thought of it as a mission statement or a description of "how it should be"...it's a description of how it is and always has been.<br/><br/>I'll go even further than it stating that agreement is required. It's an observation that the system of an RPG, despite whatever bells and whistles it contains, and despite anything else it does (and it might do a lot!), serves the function of codifying and structuring the process for obtaining this consent.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> said:

                            I think that certain trends in popular play culture of the earlier decades were leading toward an implied social contract of roleplaying that effectively involved surrendering the right to instance-by-instance consent in favor of rigid systems of who could introduce things and how.<br/><br/>Assuming that's the case, perhaps the reason you were so outraged by the player's refusal to accept the INT loss was because it was a violation of that social contract.<br/><br/>I hope it goes without saying that there are all sorts of terrible things about this model, and even if you say the lumpley principle "wasn't a mission statement", I think to some people it essentially became a kind of rallying cry (or at least, an eye-opener) in response to those problems.                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">Sandra,<br/><br/>I'm referring to the whole philosophical "gamestate" debate, not D&amp;D and blorb play (which are awesome, and I've been doing for, literally, decades). None of my comments here have anything to do with 2097e (which is awesome), or any of the other things you've been posting. I'm sorry, I don't know how to make that any clearer, and I'm sorry I've upset you. <br/><br/>Is it not the case that the whole "gamestate" debate was entirely theoretical until Vincent brought in this example? I might have missed something; I've stayed away from reading the whole ZONKING/VANKING conversation, for instance, so maybe I'm just not up to date. If so, I apologize for that, too!</blockquote>
The kind of OSR play that has been discussed extensively here, including by Eero and you for several years, tends to rely quite heavily on the non-shared parts of the game state. Using modules and random encounter tables and so on.<br/><br/>Could you clarify why and how these are not concrete examples?
<blockquote class="Quote">Sandra ( <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> ), I know that your model is dear to your heart. You're arguing patiently and passionately and have been very accomodating to boot (e.g. by changing the terminology). This is all to your great credit, as are many other things (e.g. Saliency/Wallpaper principle). But isn't it possible we just disagree on some points without being meanies?<br/></blockquote>
I am not Sandra and do not write for her, but, in general, in order to come to the conclusion that you actually disagree about something, it you first need to believe the other party understands you. (General "you" here, not Johann in particular.)<br/><br/>A good way of doing this is stating what the other is claiming in your own words and asking if that is correct, or trying to apply the theory developed by the other party to some other scenario and verifying that you have done it correctly. Yet another way is presenting possible interpretations of what the other party is saying and asking if they mean one of those.
<blockquote><br/>It's similar to free will, perhaps: I may philosophically believe there is no free will, but I still have to decide what to do after I finish this sentence. It's impossible for me to <i>not</i> decide on a course of action (or inaction) even if I am convinced my actions are ultimately predetermined. Similarly, it's impossible for something to enter the SIS without my consent/knowledge [edited to add:] <i>in the moment</i>. I can't switch off this feature.<br/></blockquote>
This is true.<br/><br/>It is worth noticing that one can, in many practical situations, effectively consent to what the other will do. I think you are referring to the possibility, which always exists, that you (for whatever reason) do disagree with the other's contributions; yes, that does always exist.
<blockquote><br/>(This is why I'm okay with your definition of gamestate as "SIS plus X" but disagree with the claim that you can change the gamestate (i.e., any part of it, e.g. the SIS) without my consent/knowledge. If I understand things correctly, there is an off-screen canon gamestate (gamestate minus SIS, among other things, right?). I totally get that we can change that and benefit from a deeper understanding of the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i>.)<br/></blockquote>
I do not think anyone has claimed that the SIS, in particular, can be changed unilaterally without consensus. That is against the definition.<br/><br/>However, the game state, in general, can certainly be.<br/><br/>That is: There exist games in which parts of the game state can be changed without consensus and communication.<br/><br/>It is not true that every part of the game state can be changed without consensus and communication.<br/>The previous sentence is equivalent to saying: It is true that in every game state there exist some parts that can not be changed without consensus and communication.                        </div>

                            That's a good question, Thanuir.<br/><br/>I've been a little lost by the whole "gamestate" debate, because it feels like each participant is making slightly different claims. Sometimes it feels like what is being suggested is ludicrous (along the lines of an imaginary thing being *actually, literally real*!) and sometimes it feels like what is being suggested is entirely common sense (e.g. we take notes and prep content for our games).<br/><br/>Certainly OSR-style gaming (and, in fact, most RPGs!) have <i>some</i> prepared material, and many assume a strong commitment to honouring that prep. That's not anything new, I hope, to anyone. (Although I can understand how it could be a revelation to someone like Sandra, who managed to avoid that style of play for a long, long time! Of course. That would be quite a surprise/shock, I'm sure.)<br/><br/>So, does OSR-style game prep constitute an example of "gamestate"? Yes, sure, I think (again, depending on what "gamestate" actually means). <br/><br/>However, if there are stronger claims to be made (such as that we're discovering new principles or techniques!*), I'm likely to hold off on being convinced until I see some new techniques or principles emerging from that understanding. I, generally, don't trust a theory until it can be put into practice and produce something.<br/><br/>A theory that is somehow revolutionary (or even evolutionary) should be able to be expressed in game design (or play technique) in some fashion. Certainly ideas like the BCB Principle, for example, can be seen to have directly inspired or influenced some new and revolutionary games and techniques.<br/><br/>Have we yet seen anything new from these ideas? Not in the context of these threads, at least, I feel. (Though I did really like AsIf's poisoned nails example! That's a very interesting one.) <br/><br/>I should clarify that I'm NOT saying "the participants have had no good ideas and no intelligent discussion". No, not at all! I think there's been some great discussion and insights. I just mean that no one has yet taken the theory into a practical/design realm, within those threads/discussions. (Again, maybe I've missed some threads or posts, though! Feel free to point to some, if I have.)<br/><br/>(And it's not fair of me to *expect* any such thing, either: these things take time, and that's quite natural and to be expected. I'm not accusing anyone of anything!)<br/><br/>Vincent pointing to his design is the first example offered in this discussion so far (again, unless I'm missing something). It's interesting and novel, because it uses some sort of "offscreen gamestate" information in a new way: not only is it unknown to all the players, but we can even have the players switch over, while that content remains. That's new, I think! <br/><br/>(I say "I think" because I'm not yet sure if that's different from an old-fashioned adventure module or a Choose Your Own Adventure book, or not. I could see arguments either way, and it's why I<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486169/#Comment_486169" rel="nofollow"> asked Vincent that question earlier in that thread</a>. I still hope he'll tell us what he thinks on that topic!)<br/><br/>So, if having prepped content for a game and honouring it is all the "gamestate" is, then, yes, absolutely, OSR-style adventure design is strong evidence of a "gamestate". If, on the other hand, we are claiming to be exploring new territory, I'd like to see that expressed in concrete examples of design or play - it's the ultimate testing ground for theory!<br/><br/><br/>* Which would be awesome, and is my hope.                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">Nobody's disputing that in rpgs, the moment of communication is a moment of communication . . . The question is, <i>what else</i>? </blockquote>I've always been fascinated by how much a given player's <i>experience</i> of play (beyond just hidden info on their sheet or other unshared knowledge) can depend so highly on unshared stuff in their head.  The communication may be the glue that keeps the group working together, but I think it could be argued that the glue is a small percentage of the total imagined material.  The dungeon I imagine and the dungeon you imagine do meaningfully overlap at times, but beyond that we may parse them in very different ways.  <br/><br/>I agree that there's no need for design to address only the overlap.  <br/><br/>I'd venture to guess that design often has targeted the overlap because it has seemed both important and in need of help to pull off successfully.  I'm not sure if that last part is as true elsewhere.                        </div>

Wait, that's ridic, Paul. There's nothing new in Gromoire at all; Vincent's just more explicit about it. The new bit is the presentation, not the substance.

You buy Keep on the Borderlands. You haven't read it thoroughly yet. Scheduling a game with your middle school friends is tough. On Friday, you run a session for Alice and Bob, reading the relevant bits of the adventure as the PCs explore. On Saturday, you run a session for Carol and Duncan, keeping the continuity from the first session, and reading more of the adventure as the PCs explore a different avenue.<br/><br/>Exactly the same thing, 40 years ago!<br/><br/>And how is all the design &amp; praxis that Sandra's done for her game over the last 5 years <i>not</i> new? The clarification and application of No Paper Before Rock? That's major!                        </div>

Well, perhaps it's only not new <i>to me</i>; that's possible.

If you are confused, please ask explicit questions about your points of confusion. If you feel the need to ask the same question again, please also point out why the previous answers have been inadequate. If you feel you are repeating yourself, the conversation is probably not proceeding very well.<br/><br/>In particular, concerning the claim that "what is being suggested is ludicrous (along the lines of an imaginary thing being *actually, literally real*!)", I would suggest the following options:<br/><br/>1. If you do not think it is fruitful to discuss who has said what about this matter, then do not refer to it.<br/>2. If you do think that discussion about who has said what about stuff being actually really real would be fruitful, then let us do it properly: Quote people and link to the sources so everyone can verify them, and also be explicit about what you think they mean by real, "real", literally real, actually real, and so on.<br/><br/>I do not remember much about metaphysics, but maybe the three world of Popper might useful here: Summary at wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popper%27s_three_worlds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popper's_three_worlds</a> . My vague recollection is that Popper's theory might face problems as rigorous metaphysics, but maybe the notions of different levels of truth could be useful in the present discussion.<br/><br/>In Popper's terms, I doubt anyone is saying that because I write "unicorn" on my random encounter table, then suddenly a unicorn appears in the physical reality, perhaps on my backyard. That is to say, world one in Popper's terms is probably not what anyone has claimed.<br/><br/>So, if (and only if) you want to keep bringing up what other people have said about something being real, please be more specific about what you mean by real. Popper's metaphysics or some other theory might be helpful, or maybe not. Feel free to use your own words if that is easier.

By my definition, much of OSR-style prep adds to the game state, but the game state also has lots of other stuff.<br/><br/>I would guess that most others would agree with this. If someone disagrees, let us talk.
<blockquote>However, if there are stronger claims to be made (such as that we're discovering new principles or techniques!*), I'm likely to hold off on being convinced until I see some new techniques or principles emerging from that understanding.

It can happen that someone figures out a concept, gives it a name, and then uses it in new productive ways.<br/><br/>More usual is that people have an idea but they can not really articulate it very well, they use it in messy ways, and then at some point the idea may be sharpened in discussions and some related terms defined. The idea will probably continue to be used throughout the process.<br/><br/>If you consider how OSR gaming of the type discussed at Story games has been formulated, then you might check out, in a very rough chronological order, Finch's quick primer, Raggi's guide to adventure writing, Raggi's referee book for Lamentations, Eero's writings here, Principia apocrypha <a href="https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html</a> (Milton, Moreau, Lumpkin, Perry) and Sandra's writings here. There are various blog posts and such I could also list; the blog for Into the odd being an excellent one, but I do not have a good grasp of the timing and will not check now.<br/><br/>The specific words "game state" have not really been used, but the idea of committing to preparation and seeing what happens in play has been around for quite some time. When explaining this to traditional gamers, some of the required concepts have been railroading and fudging as something to avoid, and then "rulings not rules" when talking to modern D&amp;D people. "player skill" as opposed to "character skill", too, and combat as war vs sport. Many of those concepts are not terribly relevant for the hardcore story gamer (whatever it means), but it seems that the idea of game state was.<br/><br/>This idea of theory vocabulary being a means of communication to say that we are doing something differently from what you are, and in pointing towards the particular difference, just occurred to me and seems useful.<br/><br/>Consider how "system does matter" has been widely misunderstood as a slogan, but has still been fairly effective in saying that in these/some games, we actually take the written rules seriously and do not mess with them, even though that is not what the theoretical meaning is at all.<br/><br/>Sorry for the digression.                        </div>

                            Agreed!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a>, you seem to be assuming that I'm entirely unfamiliar with a bunch of things that I actually know quite well. (For example, several of the things you're referring me to are things that I was a central/major participant in, or even instigated myself!)<br/><br/>Beyond that, I'm not sure what to say! <br/><br/>It feels like the whole "gamestate"/blorb discussion's claims are becoming less and less radical, and as they do so, I find myself agreeing with them more and more. My objections, all along, were to the rather more incredible claims it seemed that some people were making; the current discussion seems pretty reasonable, in comparison! Like Johann (in his post, above), I'm happy to see us meeting in the middle. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>I'm still hoping Vincent will say more about whether and how some of these ideas may have implications for both theory and design: it sounds like it's made some light bulbs go off in his head, and he may have a very different way of presenting the same realizations.                        </div>

If you believe they're becoming less radical you are misunderstanding them.<br/>It's absolutely radical.<br/>I'm not nearing any kind of "middle" at all.<br/>I'm sticking with full blorb.                        </div>

                            The three big tools I’ve taken away from this are:<br/><br/>A) Prep is a demand not a suggestion: When the entities are in prep, they are in the game, I don’t get to not use them or change them based on whim. <br/><br/>B ) Session 0: Either pre-play or at designated points, there will be a session 0 where I’m allowed to interject entities that break the rock/paper principle. I’m not allowed to interject entities when not in the session 0 state.<br/><br/>C) When A or B don’t work for some reason, create a tier of truth mechanic to introduce entities.<br/><br/>This whole debate has really clarified my thinking.                        </div>

                            I'm personally trying to nuance your rule B. I still want to be careful about the, uh, "challenge element" of the entities ("chasm width"–problem). The believability / buy-in issue ("what's my aunt doing in the dungeon") I can address by making it clear to the players to what extent I've injected custom entities.                        </div>

                            It was you talking about the chasm width problem that was the big light bulb moment for me. It was like running your tongue over the roof of your mouth and noticing a splinter that had been there for so long you’d kind of forgotten about it.<br/><br/>That being said, I’m not doing challenge based play with Finchian resolution, so a lot of the solutions are probably easier for me. For instance, I think I can embrace wallpaper into saliency far more easily because it’s less likely to mess stuff up. <br/><br/>With salient npc’s I can just put them where they would be ‘by going into identification stance and figuring out where they end up (or what they’re doing off-screen).<br/><br/>I still need to think more about this but I’d probably have something like the ‘rule of boring’. So if your aunt is established as being held in a dungeon (during a session 0), then that’s cool. Otherwise your aunt is just in the most obvious place she’d be given who she is. Of course if your aunt is a world renowned dungeon delver than maybe she is in a dungeon, then you can use a random table or something.<br/><br/>When I was thinking about tiers of truth for my games I was playing around with the following.<br/><br/>1) Prep<br/>2) The most obvious or boring based on already established facts <br/>3) Roll a dice<br/><br/>This gets awkward because a lot depends on the game system you’re using and that type of stuff but an example of this might be.<br/><br/>A Player questions the cop in the evidence room, but we already know the precinct has a lot of corrupt cops. (so is evidence guy corrupt?)<br/><br/>If the evidence guy isn’t in prep then what makes the most sense based on what’s already been established, keeping in mind to be obvious/boring. <br/><br/>If that doesn’t solve it then create a quick table. 1-2: he’s got integrity and isn’t corrupt. 3-4: he’s not corrupt but he won’t sell out his fellow officers. 5-6: he’s corrupt.<br/><br/>Anyway I think rule of boring would work well in a sufficiently prepped Narrativist game, where natural session 0, occur with some regularity. The kicker being resolved in Sorcerer for instance.                        </div>

                            Right. That demands the players and the GM to guess at the saliency of facts.<br/><br/>Sandra’s approach is to be far more rigorous than necessary, to protect the fragility of the blorb, no matter what.<br/><br/>AlexanderWhite’s is a bit more practical/forgiving. <br/><br/>I think that, in practice, the question you’ve just outlined, Jeph, is one of the most important to consider for this style of play!

"That chasm looks Really Hard But Not Impossible to jump."

Indeed. This is what I tend to see (and use) in this playstyle, as well. It aligns almost exactly 1-for-1 with Sandra's stated principles (her "tiers of truth"), and so it fits very accurately into this "style" of play and GMing.<br/> </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">I intend a perfectly extreme position.</blockquote>
The extreme (thus, interesting) position I have noticed thus far is that blorb/klokkverk should be an-or-nothing thing.<br/><br/>I think the discussion about game state was mostly a way of clarifying positions and making it possible to discuss about that position, and hopefully others. The definition itself was not supposed to be particularly interesting, but since people were just hashing out what the thing means, from slightly different perspectives, while at the same time having the discussion about positions they held, of course it was messy. It is not clear if the discussion without the mess would have happened.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a>   ‘Salient known unknowns’ is a really good way of putting it.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <del> Sandra is the blorb pope so she can correct me if I’m wrong but I see blorb as having two pillars. Exploration and Resolution distribution.<br/><br/>Resolution distribution is how shit pans out. So how prep status and Entity introduction effect the salient resolutions. <br/><br/>Exploration is the mutual commitment to shared discovery. <br/><br/>In (some) OSR style play, because of the resolution systems, the two go hand in hand and build off each other.<br/><br/>Blorb minimalism is the attempt  by the GM to keep their hands off the resolution of the situation when it’s gone ‘live.’ (resolution distribution) <br/><br/>Full blorb attempts to take the exploration factor out of the players (and GM’s) hands (exploration disavowal) AND resolution distribution.<br/><br/>So In a Wicked Age and Sorcerer are examples of Blorb minimalism (or they come close) but not necessarily examples of full blorb. Apocalypse world isn’t quite blorb minimalist, Monsterhearts can easily be made blorb minimalist, lady blackbird really isn’t, Burning Wheel isn’t.<br/><br/>This all makes perfect sense to me but might come across as gibberish. </del><br/><br/>Edit: With hindsight, too much gibberish.                         </div>

                            I wouldn’t mix the techniques of blorb (a pretty well defined field now, thanks in large part to Sandra’s superhuman efforts) with the idea of “a mutual commitment to shared discovery”, personally. That sounds like a slippery slope; after all, in most games were coming to play to find out *something*. I’d stick to the technical tools of blorb, or we’d risk getting into some really confusing territory.                        </div>

                            Kind of! The grimoires in The Wizard's Grimoire, The Three Scrolls, and The Thief &amp; the Necromancer are intended for the wizards, not for the volunteers, so they're quite different in contents and structure.<br/><br/>You could safely read, like, Sections I-III of The Three Scrolls, if you wanted, even if you intend to work through that grimoire someday. That's what the grimoires are like, fundamentally. New things that your wizard can do, and the rules for doing them, not pick lists for creating things like in "The Book of Doomed Wizards."                        </div>

                            Once you take the step and start playing, they're the easiest games to play that I've created yet. Just incredibly easy to play.<br/><br/>The only thing you have to be able to do to make it work is, ask questions. Some gamers struggle with this, I don't know why. But just, "what do I see?" "Who's here?" "I'm looking for X, do I see it?" "How dark is it?" "How do they react to me?" "What's on the other side?" "How's she dressed?"<br/><br/>When I'm telling people about the game in person, we always start playing by accident. I tell them, "my job is to ask you questions and your job is to answer them with whatever you think is fun and good. So maybe I'll say, 'I'm set upon by brigands. What do they look like? Are they on horseback or on foot?' And you say...?"<br/><br/>And they say, "Oh! Um... They're on foot."<br/><br/>"Cool, if they were on horseback I'd be sunk. How many of them are there? Can I tell who the leader is?"<br/><br/>"There are six of them? They don't seem to have a leader, but they aren't, like, confused or disorganized or anything."<br/><br/>"Hm. Where are they right now?"<br/><br/>"Oh they're surrounding you, they came right up to the edge of your camp on all sides."<br/><br/>"See, like that! And I have this grimoire I'm working through-"<br/><br/>"But wait, don't you want to deal with the brigands?"                        </div>

                            Oh sure. I don't have to deal with the brigands when I'm just telling people about the game. If we were really playing, though, then I would for sure!<br/><br/>To play as the wizard, (a) you choose a spawning circumstance from the list, and (b) your goal is to start from there and get yourself into trouble. Maybe you'll get yourself out of trouble again, that's left up in the air. So you just start asking questions, whatever questions you want, and then you say what you do, and ask what happens next, and you keep saying what you do, and asking what happens, and the whole time you're just trying to get yourself into trouble. Which won't be too hard.<br/><br/>Once you're like, "ah, yep, I'm in trouble," you can change tack and try to get out of it again, or keep digging in, that's up to you. By then you've got a rhythm down and you'll be feeling confident in the process.<br/><br/>At some point you'll want to start making exertions instead of just saying what you do, because the exertions shift some of the answering power back to you, for just a moment, case by case. But the first time you play, you can just note that they're listed on your character sheet for when you want them, and focus on getting the process going first.<br/><br/>I dunno! Sometimes when people tell me that they don't understand how to play one of my games, and I give them a procedural answer like this one, it wasn't a procedural answer they needed. Is it this kind of procedural answer you need, or a different kind of answer?                        </div>

                            Great answers, Vincent. I like this evolution of design, coming down from the Doomed Pilgrim. (Or did it start earlier, in some other design of yours?)                        </div>
