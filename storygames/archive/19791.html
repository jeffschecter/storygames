Look up the tiny little +number somewhere where it says \u201cstealth\u201d. Same goes for spellcasting attack bonus, sword tohit, etc etc and also damage added to weapons.<br/><br/>But a lot of these numbers are just one of the basic six traits, plus <em>sometimes</em> your proficiency bonus.<br/>The game has a clean design where you roll dex to sneak, and if you\u2019re trained, you add your proficiency bonus as well.<br/>(I\u2019m a long-time advocate for baking numbers together instead of re-adding them all the time, but that goes for when you understand what\u2019s going on, I now feel.)<br/><br/>Here is a \u201cLevel Zero Hero\u201d: generate (or pregenerate) the six stats. You don\u2019t have a proficiency bonus and you don\u2019t have any class features. If you\u2019re a demi, you get that stuff as usual (like the hobbit\u2019s \u201cLucky\u201d trait). Weapons do their normal damage, and thrown, finesse etc are still in the game.<br/>Your to-hit bonus is now str for melee weapons and dex for ranged weapons. Everything is one of the six stats.<br/><br/>This idea is for people who are super new to D&amp;D. I mean, I was thinking of people like for example my parents, if I ever was to play with them.<br/><br/>Whenever you want, after a couple of encounters or whenever you want (you don\u2019t need any particular amount of XP, though you collect XP as normal when you\u2019re a level zero hero) you can upgrade to a class level. Your proficiency bonus is now two. Complete the character and start playing D&amp;D rules-as-written.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll easier understand that your \u201cskills\u201d, \u201ctool proficiencies\u201d, \u201cweapon proficiencies\u201d, \u201cspellcasting attack roll\u201d all work the same way.<br/><br/>The fact that the whole skill-list is printed (in ant-sized font) on the default, non-alternate character sheet is a double edged sword. It makes the inner workings of the game harder to really see, the game looks more opaque and more like a \u201cblack box\u201d. I kind of wish they hadn\u2019t done this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438993/#Comment_438993" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T09:11:24+00:00" title="October  4, 2014  9:11AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is doable, and is one of the options presented in some old AD&amp;D supplements as well.<br/><br/>You probably should have 6 hit points plus your Con modifier.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not convinced this is any more useful for new players, if your goal is to eventually teach them the proficiency bonus system.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438994/#Comment_438994" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T12:42:22+00:00" title="October  4, 2014 12:42PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not, Caoimhe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438995/#Comment_438995" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T14:18:58+00:00" title="October  4, 2014  2:18PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it. I agree with Sandra that it is useful to understand the skill checks in terms of ability checks in the 5th edition framework as we've seen so far, and that's a fine way to go about teaching it that way. Note that the game text itself construes it this way, even if the character sheet doesn't.<br/><br/>I also like your rule for playing 0-level characters (a staple concern, every edition after AD&amp;D 1st has had a procedure for that): start without class features, pick a class when the fiction or whatever suggests one to you. Simple, and works just fine for the sorts of campaigns that traditionally use 0-level characters. I might let a classless character who gets to halfway point to 2nd level to call themselves a "veteran" and use a +1 proficiency bonus until they find their class, but that's just me being complicated <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439002/#Comment_439002" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T23:28:28+00:00" title="October  4, 2014 11:28PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, as well.<br/><br/>But, wait!<br/><br/>Eero, there's a 0-level rule in AD&amp;D?

The way I figured the "veteran" would work is that they'd get the +1 proficiency bonus to everything applicable as per their background and expressed leanings. I'd be comfortable leaving this up to the player as the GM, really - doesn't really rock my faith in humanity if a player wants to add +1 to everything they do while foregoing the actual class abilities they could have, instead <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Sure, this might mean that they'll "lose" that +1 from a given skill when they finally get a class, thus actually becoming a little bit less effective in that regard, but I can't really say that I'd be bothered by that - I, also, am less effective in many skills now that I've chosen a vocation, when comparing to my past less specialized self.<br/><br/>Also, I'm with Kristin and Christopher on the story utility of non-leveled characters; it's a classic launch for a campaign to say that the PCs are "ordinary villagers thrust in the middle of adventure". I think that the notion of not picking your class yet fits well in that, especially if you get a bit hard-ass about it and only allow the players to choose a class their characters are fictionally situated for. This could potentially mean going through a few adventures before a character finally settles on accepting an apprenticeship with an eremitic druid or whatever.<br/><br/>If memory serves, the old AD&amp;D rules for 0 level were quite clumsy by my aesthetics. I think you'd start at negative experience points and work your way up, something like that? (I might be remembering the Cavalier, one of the weirder AD&amp;D things.)

And, yes, players were only allowed to choose a class which they were fictionally situated for. (Which everyone enjoyed - if they ever met a famous hero or an old man with lots of stories, they would hound them and try to find out more about their past to see what *kind* of hero they were, and whether the stories were *true*. A couple of times, I designed custom classes in response, to match the histories of these heroes, which came into play if a character chose to undergo an apprenticeship with one of these heroes.)<br/><br/>I distinctly remember having to make up my own rules for this, though.

I think that the notion of not picking your class yet fits well in that, especially if you get a bit hard-ass about it and only allow the players to choose a class their characters are fictionally situated for.

My own D&amp;D gloss doesn't use a skill list despite having very similar skill proficiency rules, specifically because I don't even pretend to approach a comprehensive, objective, always-optimal skills breakdown; the most useful approach to skills that I've ever seen is to have them be opt-in, so that individual characters may possess some specific proficiencies without implying anything about the rest of the campaign setting. This way, if I ever need to have a character with a skill in say Skiing, I can, and that doesn't cause weird knock-on effects on the skill lists of other unconnected characters.<br/><br/>I guess that an explicit and detailed skill list is popular in WotC D&amp;D because it allows them to organize very specific write-ups about how to resolve various situations, and use the skill list as headers for that list. So instead of listing "This is how you resolve climbing challenges", they can write "Climbing: how to use this skill". This is, I guess, sort of more clear than saying that "you climb with Dexterity checks, and apply suitable proficiencies such as Climbing, Mountaineering, Cat-thievery, where applicable". After all, how will you know when and which proficiencies apply to situations if the book doesn't list what each proficiency is used for explicitly, duh <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I guess that I'm arguing for a skill listless character sheet with spontaneous skill definition, if I ever end up running 5th edition. Not like the game fundamentally cares about the skill list as this whole, entire collection - all the rules reference individual skills (or "all skills" when it comes to that Bard class feature), and it's not exactly beyond my powers to be flexible about which skills apply to which situations, if non-standard skills players invent should cause confusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439107/#Comment_439107" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T12:18:51+00:00" title="October  6, 2014 12:18PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But it <em>is</em> pretty much like that, Eero, just that the character sheet design obfuscates it.

That lowers the chance of supremely powerful characters via attributes. Might have to put in some bonus points for when you hit 1st finally, depending on what kind of stats your people are used to seeing. <br/><br/>In our version for instance what you roll depends on if you're going to start in the Novice block (basically 0 level classless for 6 levels) or the Apprentice block (equivalent to 1st level in a class in previous editions). Novices roll 3d6, but earn a bonus attribute point (with restrictions) each level until Apprentice, whereas starting at Apprentice let's you roll 4d6D1. The latter creates characters with an average of 4.5 more attribute points, but people who don't like 0 level play tend to prefer higher attributes anyway, so it works well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deinol" title="deinol"><img alt="deinol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deinol">deinol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439126/#Comment_439126" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T15:58:19+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  3:58PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it depends on what your goal is.

If the campaign is going to transition into standard 5E progression with 4d6 drop the lowest, I don't see anything wrong with the 0th level characters starting the same. <br/><br/>As it is, I always prefer point buy. (Actually, I prefer pick one of these three stat lines.) You know that guy that manages to roll at least one 18 per character? I'm the guy who rolls a 5 on 4d6 drop the lowest to help balance out the universe.</blockquote>\nWell let's say your story is a bunch of 12-16yr old kids just starting out with no classes yet. 4d6D1 (or the standard array, or average point buy) is going to usually create some pretty high stats...higher than might be rational for that age/experience bracket. What's more, the point of such games is often to explore (as a part of the game) the sudden, rapid growth that takes place just prior to, and at the early stages of, a career/path. Starting with full stats doesn't offer that simulation, whereas starting with reduced stats (via rolling or point buy) with quick bonuses gained along the way could. That allows you to play the full, normal scope of the game, but add the low power/youth/average element to the early parts.<br/><br/>One other point is that our group is firmly pre-3rd with regards to what attributes mean. At our tables, 20 is absolute natural human max in an attribute (barring magic), and 10.5 is the worldwide average. We also prefer the more representative distribution curve (as presented in pre-3rd roughly), as opposed to the flatter one obtained using 3rd+ attribute bonuses. That means that in our games exceptional (16+) attributes are TRULY exceptional (just like someone with an Int equivalent `160IQ would be in our world). 18+ are PHENOMENALLY rare, even at higher levels (which is what someone who benches ~511lbs due to Str should be). That lets us abide the lower stats generated by a 3d6 or reduced point system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deinol" title="deinol"><img alt="deinol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deinol">deinol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439145/#Comment_439145" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T19:14:50+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  7:14PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I was saying whatever your end goal stats are supposed to be, you can let your 0th level characters start with those. So if 1st level characters are getting 3d6, that's fine too. The lack of attack bonus and skills/proficiencies can represent their youthfulness. But you can easily adjust to taste.<br/><br/>I do prefer the bonus breakdown of DCC, where 18 is +3, 16-17 is +2, and 13-15 is +1. It more closely reflects the rarity of those higher numbers. (I think the Rules Cyclopedia chart was similar as well.) Actually, I've been tempted to drop the 3-18 system entirely, and try rolling 4dF for stat bonus generation.
