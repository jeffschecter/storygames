Thanks to the hideously expensive and complex wormhole technology, we will be able to send a small vessel for a brief sojourn to a rocky Earth-sized world recently detected orbiting Epsilon Eridani. We know only this: the world has water and oxygen, is in the habitable zone of its parent star, and shows spectral lines of organic molecules.<br/><br/>Your job is to help us brainstorm regarding some of the strange terrain, ecosystems, and hazards our crew might encounter on this alien world so we can adequately prepare our exploration team for every eventuality.<br/><br/>What might a scientific team exploring an alien world discover? I'm looking for wild speculation rooted in hard science.

The trick is to read in as little as possible, human social constructions. This isn't as easy as it sounds. Primatologist have mistakenly read human, and more specifically modern Western, notions of gender, sexuality and social relationship into chimp behaviours. We have a great deal of trouble not anthropomorphizing species we're readily familiar with, much less alien ones. <br/><br/>My suggestion would be to make the creatures literally unknowable, full of paradoxes and subtle relationships, much like most of the life on Earth. Contemporary biologists are still confounded by many phenomena and there is much they can't readily account for. A new world of biology is going to be very, very strange indeed. So start with a few possible but arbitrary axioms for the life there and develop them unevenly without worrying to much about consistency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242326/#Comment_242326" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T00:10:54+00:00" title="November 17, 2009 12:10AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2009 12:13AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An entire planet of monocellular ecosystems, with similar niches (photosynthetics and thermosynthetics, those that eat them, and those that eat them) to Earth.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242327/#Comment_242327" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T00:12:10+00:00" title="November 17, 2009 12:12AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grasses.<br/><br/>And in the grasses, worlds*.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>* Grasses have by far the most non-expressed "junk DNA" of any species.

Evolution doesn't have ideals. It doesn't have progress. Sometimes, stuff doesn't work out. Either the descendants of the artists are no longer capable of art, or they're completely extinct. I'm imagining that the 13-fold gene gave them both more brainpower (each fold of the symmetry has a chunk of nervous system with a certain amount of local nervous networking and a "router" that communicates with other folds. The "routers" do the intelligent stuff, co\xf6rdinating the limbs, so the more of them there are, the more abstract the thought processes can be, but the greater the overhead per "router", so they probably can't get all the way to 21 fold without evolving <em>much</em> more powerful "routers"), but they were prone to diseases. For instance, there's a certain number of vertebrae that no animal on Earth has (I can't remember how many it is), and it's sort of a mystery why that is. A few years back, it turned out that a pretty straightforward mutation gives that number of vertebrae in humans, but the fetuses never stay viable. The gene responsible for that number of vertebrae also turns on something that kills fetuses.</p>\n<p>That's also the reasoning behind the Fibonacci sequence of folds: other numbers are possible through mutation, but for mysterious reasons, the genes (whatever their form) for non-Fibonacci forms of symmetry carry congenital diseases, so the forms don't last, even in the rare case where they make it all the way to birth. I was sort of imagining their genes are golden spirals in structure, somehow, so non-Fibonacci numbers just kinda don't sync up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242346/#Comment_242346" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T05:25:46+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  5:25AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2009 5:26AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The planet is at the extreme edge of the habitable band.

Geothermal energy keeps the inside relatively warm, rarely dropping below freezing. The steam itself condenses rapidly and falls as mildly acidic rain in the center of the continent and ice on the edges. That phenomenon makes a huge ice wall glacier that separates much of the polar region from the rest of the planet. The glacial wall itself reaches well into the upper atmosphere, making it nearly impassible.</p>\n<p>The shallow outer slopes of the wall are covered with sulfur expressed from the ice as it compacts and, at lower elevations, are also covered with a slime mold-like entity that consumes it. Despite the sulfuric acid defenses the slime has, it would seem to be a favorite food of a trifold species. Covered with a fine cellulose fur to protect itself from the cold, the 10cm creatures spend their days grazing at the edges of the slime mold while the mold slowly moves away.</p>\n<p>Those trifold species are, in turn, consumed by what would appear to be the sole flying form of life on the planet: hydrogen-filled, floating pentaforms.

These things are like lightning that <em>wants</em> to strike someone and evolution has taken that into account. The floating pentaform, on the other hand, has downward facing eyes. That works out great unless you're a floating pentaform that looks good to other varieties of floating pentaforms that float higher.</p>\n<p>Oh, hey. Here's one here!

Between these eruptions the planet ices over. There is a brief window of hundreds of years during which organic compounds form from the innards of the planet which are now on the surface in pools, but soon after they are locked away in ice. We find ourselves during the centuries of organics.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> The entire surface of the planet (and, seismic readings indicate, large veins underground) consists of a number of branching, replicating molecules - just one archetype. After years of study we will find no attractor nearby the state space of this molecule. It's clear that somewhere organic elements hit upon this molecule which catalyzed the rest of the planet, and it's too much of a local maximum for any other replicators to outcompete it. It's as if a precursor to RNA took over the earth.<br/><br/>C) Most of the planet is covered in a shallow (hundreds of meters) layer of water. Geothermal vents appear in many regions, and pock the bottom of these shallow seas with miniscule holes. Holes about the size of an earthling single-celled organism. Upon very close inspection, we find familiar machinery inside vast and just outside swathes of these holes - in each hole is a tiny replicator which builds up a charge differential and uses the discharges to assemble copies of itself. Apparently those copies can survive for upwards of a minute outside of their sheltering rock holes, and use this time to float, driven by tiny currents, living longer only if they are randomly deposited into a nearby hole.<br/><br/>D) In general the planet is rocky and barren, covered in a thin layer of ice. But on the equator the albedo is less than expected. Encircling the equator is a carpet of organized organic material, and beyond the equator it seems unorganized organic elements are somehow pushed up from somewhere beneath the surface. A cross section sample of the carpet indicates that it consists of three layers. 1) the top layer, which converts the Brownian motion of its surface (induced by solar energy) through an inefficient Rube Goldberg device into creating more copies of itself. 2) the middle layer, which is made up of various half-formed copies of the top layer and the bottom layer and wouldn't deserve to be called out except that it creates *more* copies of the half-formed pieces by cannibalizing the bottom layer. 3) the bottom layer, which is thick near the edge of the equator and thin in the middle, because it is apparently responsible for gathering new organics from the sludge where the ice begins. This layer seems to constantly grow inward as it is cannibalized by the middle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

They live a good life. Most life is microscopic (and therefore is presented and discussed in the microbiology fora, as it is outside the scope of this document) and they spend their time licking it up and having sex with each other.</p>\n<p>The microfauna (there don't seem to be true "plants" on Epsilon Eridani 4) move toward greater geyser activity for both the heat and the rich chemical broth coughed up constantly from the innards of the planet. The microfauna spend most of their time nestled into cracks in the sulfurous rock of the region and the Piglets dip their long, prehensile radul\xe6 into those crevises. As the microfauna consume the minerals, they make large hollows for themselves with only tiny openings to the outside. It's hard for more than one Piglet to get its radula in there, so evolution has granted them a solution: a staged digestive system reminiscent of the rabbits of earth.</p>\n<p>Once a Piglet has found a good eating spot, it inserts its radula and begins to eat. Other Piglets recognize the posture and will eat from the first Piglet's cloaca. While the second (and third or fourth) Piglet is eating, it's also receiving genetic material from those ahead of it in line. Even when the front Piglet is finished eating, however, the others will stay attached for hours or even days. While the genetic information coming down the line is almost total nonsense by the fifth in line, long chains of a dozen Piglets have been spotted, as well as loops and knots. Presumably, these serve a social, rather than purely reproductive/consumptive function.</p>\n<p>The last Piglet in line will lay a stream of eggs in her own droppings. Some number of the eggs hatch (the rest having been consumed by the microfauna), thrive briefly in the droppings, and rapidly begin growing to their full size of 40cm in length. Immature Piglets seem to get a greater degree of sustenance from the Piglets in front of them. Whether this is because the immature individuals have a digestive system more suitable to the poorer food or whether the Piglets ahead of them pass on more nutrients is not yet known.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242813/#Comment_242813" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T19:35:16+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  7:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A world exactly like Earth.

It has a rotational period of 253.4 Earth days leading to extreme temperatures on the lit and unlit sides of the planet.  The line between these zones is a perpetual dawn known as the terminator.  The slow rotational period means that this zone is a constant intersection of hot and cold fronts of air causing violent roiling tempests.  Elsewhere on the planet each rotation leads to seas boiling away then re-flooding as the deposited snow and ice melt while stone reaches sufficient heat to become malleable.  <br/><br/>Within the perpetual storm at the terminator exists a cooperative species that most human observers would describe as resembling a jelly fish.  The creatures are radially symetrical and consist of an outer membrane and an inner membrane surrounding clusters of pea sized storage sacks.  A combination of selective permiability and active transport along the ventral portion of the membrane allow the Jellies to collect and store the organic compounds necessary for growth along with the lighter gasses which allow it to remain aloft.  The anterior membrane is a highly conductive organ that gathers free electrons from the storm and utilizes them for a reaction very similar to photosynthesis.  Tentacles are used to anchor together with neighbouring Jellies, buffering against being thrown around by the winds, and as a sexual organ for the transmition of genetic material.  The tentacles are also highly conductive causing electrons harvested by any individual Jelly to 'spread' along their string in a form of communal feeding.<br/><br/>Jellies form 'strings' by interlocking tentacles in sequence.  Typically each Jelly will form two attachments of two tentacles each, leaving the remaining two tentacles free for single tentacle 'secondary' attachments.  There appears to be some mechanism that detects looping as Jellies will convert a secondary attachment to a primary and release their previous attachment in order to break any loops.  A string of Jellies is a single contiguous chain of primary attachments and vary from ten to several thousand individuals.  Strings can connect through secondary attachments and in the case of multiple secondary attachments may be as strong as a strings primary attachments.  Strings interconnect and interwoven are called a bundle.  It is believed that there are only two bundles, one on the dawn terminator and one on the twilight terminator, stretching from pole to pole along that line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242884/#Comment_242884" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T10:12:13+00:00" title="November 20, 2009 10:12AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the ideas, everyone!<br/><br/>I just wrapped up the "simulator phase" alpha version of my planetary exploration game Atlantis 2037 for Nathan's 2 Names 1 Game contest.

Assuming a roughly Earthlike axial tilt, you get one hemisphere with extreme seasons and one with fairly mild seasons. If there's negligible axial tilt, seasons are worldwide, and if the axial tilt is extreme, 'seasons' get so weird we might want another name for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've toyed with the idea of a planet with a near-90degree axial tilt and a dense atmosphere, where the seasons are determined not by axial variations in insolation, but by orbital eccentricity. I'm trying to figure out if there's any sort of diurnal cycle at all when day length is completely seasonal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore later if there's interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This should also help keep the inner system free of cometary impactors, so it's a win all over. One other nice thing about really large gas giants is that they can harbor Mars-sized habitable moons. And that makes localized panspermia an attractive option for sky-whales in the upper layers of the gas giant.<br/><br/>So now we have two or three life-bearing planets: one Earthlike world with extreme orbital and axial irregularities, a gas giant that may or may not harbor life itself, plus at least one habitable moon. I don't know about you, but the idea of planet-bound astronomers (if they have eyes and fire and technology and optics...) gazing into the heavens and seeing another blue-green marble up there, marked by signs of habitation... that's magic to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If we find them at their home world, then they likely aren't technologically advanced; i.e. we'd have maybe a thousand to three thousand year window to find them in "low tech" cultures before they'd become high-enough tech to be undetectable... and to blast us, if we boost into orbit. Like we already would be, if we weren't such a fucking stupid, near-sighted, hormone-driven species.<br/><br/>As a follow-up, we need more exoecologies. Too many "alien species" seem to be monolithic: they somehow are the ONLY life forms on their planets that can exploit whatever energy gradient or survivability niche is posited. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> At least with my own Veelab concept, I imagine them as SO post-evolutionary that they control every single resource on a world, encapsulating the whole planet (thereby also exploiting 100% of solar energy hitting the planet). And their exotic (i.e. implausible) biology means they can exploit planet (and moon, and asteroid) types that are of minimal utility to other organic species, except for mining purposes (and even then, some worlds wouldn't even be worth THAT effort).<br/><br/>ALL that said... a single illustrated sample of an alien doesn't necessarily imply that's the only species on a posited planet. Just that it's the one in which the theoretician-artist was interested at the time. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244657/#Comment_244657" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T12:40:19+00:00" title="December  2, 2009 12:40PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good one from Jack McDevitt: scientists investigate a world whose ice-age has nearly wiped out its pre-industrial society, but then discover hyper-advanced ruins on the world along with evidence that a more advanced race engineered a massive rescue effort on the native race before the ice-age struck.<br/><br/>One from an Atlantis 2037 playtest with Ben Lehman: a planet with no volcanic activity which nevertheless has large regions full of rocks that on earth only form under the pressure and heat associated with volcanism.

That means a lot to me, coming from you.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Edited for an afterthought: Why do all of these alien societies you guys are coming up with seem less technologically evolved than we are?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I have a less pleasant explanation than David does, and an excuse for the way I did it.</p>\n<p>I think it's in part because of the colonialist assumptions that are often the thematic meat of such a piece of fiction. We, as Euro-Americans, have this idea of "progress" that's been a big deal since the 18th century, and we have these ugly vestiges of it in our fiction.</p>\n<p>The reason I did it this way, though, is to make another statement: evolution isn't about finding <em>us</em>. It's about whatever's working, do that again. I have a deliberately extinct species of art-makers, precisely because I wanted to say, "If sapience doesn't give you an evolutionary advantage, <em>that's just like ridiculous plumage</em>."</p>\n<p>And, speaking of ridiculous plumage, I present to you the Warriors, a species living in the small southern geyland named "Southern Heart" after its shape as observed from orbit.</p>\n<p><img alt="Come out and plaaaayaaaaayyyy!" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1392732/Epsilon%20Eridani%204/Warriors.jpg"/></p>\n<p>Warriors, like many of the planet's species, are grazers. The rich and constantly turning ground, combined with the heat from the internal pressures of the planet makes a lot of ground-hugging microfauna. Larger creatures (see the octaform, above) leverage their size to move quickly enough to eat the colonial microfauna in an area, then move on. The Warriors are unlikely to realize if they're even eating. They wander in small herds of 20-24 individuals, absorbing food through their feet. Their eyes, high on towers, can see each others' signalling "banners" and communicate in this way, moving toward the individual whose banners indicate that it has the richest food source.</p>\n<p>The pastoral life of the Warriors quickly changes, though, when it perceives another herd. Flashing banners in easily perceptible and herd-unique colors, they herds will charge each other and crash with a great clattering of shells. The Warrior fighting technique looks ridiculous to human observers. Once the individuals are close, they raise their front feet to strike or fend off their opponents, resting on the "keel" under their ventral side and ooch closer. They slap at each others' forelimbs, trying to get past and strike at the vulnerable areas where the shells meet.</p>\n<p>But they fight not for food or territory, but to get the other herd to carry its young.</p>\n<p>Those prominent spurs are not merely to inflict wounds, but to inject a sperm packet under their opponent's skin. Once injected, the "loser" loses the will to fight (often with its "opponent" struck simultaneously, also losing its will) and will either sit down where it is, or galumph, wounded, to the back of its own herd. When all individuals on one side have lost, the two herds part ways, with many individuals badly hurt. Any individuals that have been injected carry with them developing eggs that will soon be laid. Often, a group of eggs will carry a distinctive combination of the two opponents' banners and will be left alone in a clutch to fend for themselves when they hatch together. Some of them, though, have their mother's banner and join the herd as soon as their shells have hardened and their watchtower eyes have fully extended, a process which takes no more than a day if the hatchling is healthy.</p>\n<p>This absurd and apparently self-destructive behavior ensures \u2014\xa0or at least makes likely \u2014\xa0that the strongest individuals in the best herds reproduce at greater rates, as pregnant Warriors do not fight.</p>\n<p>(Comically absurd? Yes! Also, based on some fun Earth facts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Almost all of southwest Asia \u2014\xa0India and Pakistan, notably \u2014 has a single particular male ancestor in the 12th-13th centuries. Right when Ghengis Khan was doing his thing. It looks like the dude  got around. </li>\n<li>There are several species of nudibranch that, while not social, do just this. They joust with their penises, trying to inject each other with sperm.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Edit: Just found this picture.<br/>\n<img alt="Ghengis Khan's ridiculous hat" src="http://weeklyworldnews.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/genghis-khan.jpg"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
