Then I didn't think about it, until now.<br/><br/>What I'm thinking is that I'd set up a whole seperate forum, which is ostensibly the discussion forum for the class of Professor Abalone's school of magic - the most prestigious magic college in Europe, catering to international students.  Professor Abalone herself never posts to the forum, as she's above that kind of thing, but I'd post as her TA, Reginald Fink.  <br/><br/>Anyone can join the forum, and post about any subject they like, as a character in the game.  Maybe some stories would develop, or something.  <br/><br/>Anyway, setting this up would be a bit of work, so I wanted to see if there was any interest before I started.  I think it would be a fun experiment in what, (if I become rich and famous) I'll call "Forum LARP".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127905/#Comment_127905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T04:55:26+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  4:55AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked into <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Lexicon_games" rel="nofollow">Lexicon</a> games like <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://paranoia.allenvarney.com/" rel="nofollow">The Toothpaste Disaster</a>?<br/>\n<br/>\nLexicon gives a nice structure to the game, and encourages people to fill in the gaps built by others.

To build a sort of metaplot among people (I could imagine it as a sort of communal blogg, describing and narrating events in that school, among complains, relationships, advise to others and stuff)? And how would "out of character" talk be managed? Mail, same forum (by some "etiquette" codes), other forum (or a special OOC section in the same forum)?<br/><br/>Heh! Sorry.

I was thinking that it's the forum for the whole college, which is reasonably small.  I totally want it to be a college, rather than a school, in modern-day Europe.  Setting creation is part of play, so even though it's ostensibly modern day, real world, the fact that magic is an accepted fact is obviously going to make hings different.  How different is up to the players.<br/><br/>As for rules, they're the same as for any other forum.  It's all just people posting about stuff, except they do it in character.  That's why I call it a LARP, rather than PBP.  You're playing your character, sitting at a computer, posting to a forum.  If you don't like what someone's posted, call them a liar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128148/#Comment_128148" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T15:04:13+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  3:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you going to come up with a list of courses?

I'll slap a stylesheet on it so it doesn't look identical to every other indie games forum out there.  I'm happy to do most of the forum admin work, what I really need is for someone to cover the php end of things.  I did all that when I set up Snail's Pace, so I can do it again, but it's not my area of expertise. If you could upload the basic vanilla application to your server, and set me up as an admin, I'm happy to do the rest.

"But the fact is that shrinking class sizes at those fine institutions have led inevitably to a decline in enrollment here, while the quality of public education has only risen.  The Board of Trustees and I decided that this was the time to bring us into the twenty-first century.  Also, there aren't as many sewing machine-based prep schools as you'd think."<br/><br/>While the Institute expects to welcome mostly applicants who completed secondary school in 2007 or 2008, applications are also open to nontraditonal students.  Forms are available by visiting or writing the Admissions House at 1200 Witley Ln, Effingham Half-Hundred, Surrey GU2 E78; or by visiting the Institute's Web site at <a href="http://www.xorph.com/abalone/" rel="nofollow">http://www.abalone.ac.uk</a>.<br/><br/>"We're very pleased to be opening this new door to the something something, blast it, you wrote the card too small," noted Dr Abalone himself.  "I think those thrice-cursed students have put petroleum jelly on the lenses of my spectacles again.  Where have you hidden my tea?"<br/><br/>The Institute of Thaumaturgy and Alchemy was founded in 1924 by Abalone and a contingent of professors he recruited from other schools as a reaction to what they felt were declining standards of wizardly education.  After financial difficulties during World War II, the Insitute joined forces with the Berthe Santino Ten-Week Course in Sewing Machine Repair to boost numbers and began admitting female students for the first time.  The Institute made headlines in 1998 when a group of advanced students summoned award-winning demon Belasc\xe6l Blister-the-Bone and utilized him to keep the Thaumalympic Torch lit for one leg of its journey to Nagano, Japan.  All resulting property damage was subsequently repaired, and the vast majority of lawsuits were dropped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130472/#Comment_130472" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T07:27:03+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  7:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Couple quick notes:  Please try to stick with the username policy of Firstname Lastname [or Firstname Middlename Confirmationname Maidenname Lastname or whatever], and we suggest you uncheck "show real name" in your profile once you're approved.

We should be able to link it directly from the forum. Brendan's the technical expert, so we should talk to him about it.  <br/><br/>Brendan and I talked about a wiki earlier.  I think it's a great idea, but we're a little leery of creating too much canon that has to be mastered before people can post.  You're absolutely right that keeping this in a wiki makes it more accessible than spread out between posts.  Brendan suggested a rule that posts in the forum always outrank the wiki - i.e. that whatever's in the forum is "true" (at least for that person's perspective), and the wiki is subject to revision (just like a real wiki).  <br/><br/>I think a wiki would be an awesome addition to the site.<br/><br/>I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's involved in the game (whoever you are!).  It's succeeded beyond my wildest expectation, and it couldn't have happened without the incredible creativity of the players.  I look forward to seeing what happens from here.

I mean, you can imagine your character going on An Adventure, but Lovecraft-Protagonist-Syndrome aside, they're unlikely to be posting about it <i>as it happens</i>... just afterwards, after all the excitement is over. <br/><br/>In order to prevent it from being "one player tells a story, the others appreciate, and then tell their own, unrelated stories", there were slightly awkward devices like "Contradictory reports... what do YOU remember happening?" or "But I shall let X relate the next part of the tale, because they were involved!" and so on.<br/><br/>I guess the question becomes, how else to set people up to make interesting posts?<br/><br/>If we restarted, I'd want to make a new character, I think.

There were some really neat moments, and some genuinely exciting parts.  <br/><br/>I think the problem (for me at least) came from the fact that there was no way to establish consensus for adding something to the fiction - you just had to make something up, and hope everyone else liked it.  I think that made it quite scary to post - especially about the "plot" stuff.<br/><br/>I was also worried that as the originator, stuff that I introduced would be seen as "official", and treated differently.  I really didn't want to provide all the major plot developments in the game, but I felt like when I didn't, everyone else was too shy.  <br/><br/>I'd really like to talk about the anonymity, too.

I wish that the game had built momentum more effectively, but instead it became harder and harder for me to write posts. Part of it was plot shyness, like Simon says. But when I signed up to play I made a note for myself - "everyone wants something to happen" - and even so, it became harder for me to know what to write.<br/><br/>Here's the game-technique thing I wanted: a way to tag someone, like "now it's your responsibility to say something concrete about [this], so don't let me down."<br/><br/>There must be a way to get that without having a parallel ooc conversation. (I wouldn't've played the game at all if there'd been a parallel ooc conversation. Bleh.)<br/><br/>My favorite game-technique thing was the thing where nobody got to do anything, really; instead, everybody had to say in past tense what other people's characters did.

Someone who is hip deep in, say, a Harry Potter chat game somewhere could probably school us on how to make this work.<br/><br/>It's probably different - it occurs to me that my insatiable desire for conflict and drama stems from the same diseased root that needed to be addressed when I started with improv.  <br/><br/>What's with the resistance to a parallel OOC conversation?

I would like to see it pick up, or try again, or whatever. If there was a stated system of OOC in whispers only, for instance, that might have helped head off plot-shyness. I really liked the way some things got introduced and others just ran with them. On the other hand, I felt like sometimes people's attempt at plot got shot down, so it increased plot-shyness.<br/><br/>I would have liked more direction from the 'faculty' characters. Having the few 'official reports' etc, gave the characters something to bounce off of besides themselves. I wonder what would have happened if we'd made multiple characters. Did anyone make multiple characters? Hmm.<br/><br/>Another point: the premise has two directions, as I see it. Either there's weird shit going on and we have to figure out what the heck is up, or it's just 'hey, that test was hard' 'anyone going to Albany this weekend and can give me a ride?' sort of regular college-board sort of stuff. I liked seeing the developing relationship map, and I feel like it went into a lull just as things were getting interestingly tangled. Jason, knowing who you played, were you maybe looking for more inter-character conflict? Although the bit with the frogs was brilliant, and launched the rest of the plot, really.<br/><br/>Did anyone else catch the gender shift in Prof. Abalone, who is clearly female in this thread, but

behind the scenes outcome negotiations based on character ownership, your right to your fist ends at the tip of my nose, that stuff. I think we would have fallen back on it almost at once if we'd been having a parallel ooc conversation.

So I decided to be the Eustace/Draco/Bastard character, hoping that it would lead to more interesting interaction.  For the most part it didn't, although I got to drive big chunks of the plot as people bounced off me.  If you look at my first posts, my initial idea was to play a hapless rube who sucked at everything but was cheerful, thinking it'd give me a chance to interact with everybody and contribute to other people's plots.  <br/><br/>I was surprised that we didn't see the faculty weigh in to solidify particular plot threads.  I totally missed the Abalone gender switch.<br/><br/>Regarding OOC communication, here's an interesting one:  I whispered to Addler's player saying "your room will be vandalized in some pathetic way tonight that points to Gaylord."  I wanted this to happen, but had no power to make it happen in a plausible way using my words alone - it didn't make sense coming form me.  Addler's player ignored it for whatever reason.

It really reminded me of that cartoonishly antagonistic guy on every forum, in every dorm, and the experience wouldn't have been nearly as complete without it. Vincent, your portrayal of a Creole-ish lass was high-larious, and the interplay there was fantastic.<br/><br/>On a sidenote, the game benefitted greatly from the anonymity, and knowing who I was playing with now makes the experience, post-partum, a helluva lot more complete. Now when I see you guys in real life, I can say I've played a game with you where there was a genuine state of immersion, and it really does make you folks all the more human. I, like many people, sometimes fail to see my fellow forum members as Genuine Human Beings; and, strangely enough, the game had a powerful role in counteracting that for me. That said, I'm still against forced anonymity without the "Big Reveal" at the end. I'd hate to wonder who everyone on that board was and find myself sitting across from them at a Con, unbeknownst.<br/><br/>As far as OOC goes, I really liked the idea of having declarative control only after facts had been established, which made the world seem all the more real; so, in that sense I see no problem with a whisper of "events as they unfold," particularly if you implicate your own character in the process. For instance, Jason whispered me to say "This is Gaylord, on Emerson's computer," with a post that would appear in my name. As I read back over that post, it really helped me concoct in my imagination this real dorm room, with real people in an imaginary world. That's a treasured memory for me, as much as any other memory from any other game I've played.<br/><br/>So, I think we should be able to force people's hands with actions, to some small degree. Emerson was a reactive character, but a strongly reactive character by design. I think most of us were willing to run with the ball, so now we just need a little more QB action. I have the confidence now, as I'm sure most of us do, to try a scenario again but with more authority in our narrative voice. <br/><br/>So!

From what I know of them, most are much more about shared fiction writing, where I write a couple paragraphs that advance a particular scene, then you do, then Mitch does, then the next player, then maybe me again. I also see much greater levels of Mod involvement, up to boards that have submissions checked first for continuity. Plus the whole numbers thing, where there are stats and such. I've tried several, and this was more fun because it was more immediate and mostly dialog instead of description based.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Here's the game-technique thing I wanted: a way to tag someone, like "now it's your responsibility to say something concrete about [this], so don't let me down."<br/></blockquote>\nCould it be as simple as whispering "Tag: this particular thing" and then that person says something concrete <span style="color: #CC0033;">in color text so we all know it's fact?</span> Jason, your idea of Tip-offs could work the same way. "Tip-off: your room will be etc etc." <br/><br/>I also agree that I'd like more faculty direction by way of endorsing certain things that come up, or flatly putting down others. The new 'hidden' sub-forum is nice for that, in particular the last two posts saying 'Officially, don't worry" - "But really, Worry!"<br/><br/>I agree with Jarrod, and I further suggest that those of us who wish to make a second character, to maintain anonymity, if we so desire.

I originally imagined him as male, and then when I was writing about the game, I worried that he sounded too much like Dumbledore, so I made her a woman.  Then, I guess I forgot, or maybe someone else did first, but suddenly Abalone was male again.

This would build a body of knowledge and help guide the game -the judicious endorsement of objects could move it in one direction or another.

In fact I even tried to "correct" it on the forum once... But since no one realized/cared...<br/><br/>I think this was a very good experiment. Maybe we can sort of reboot and restart it over (maybe with new characters), since we have learned from our mistakes...<br/><br/>Thinks like the wiki thing Jason mentioned would actually be very helpful...<br/><br/>There are some meta-gaming things we could try too... Such as "this time it is Gaylord's turn to introduce a mayor subplot to the storyline, and everyone else should add something. He can't be contradicted as far as the facts go, and everyone should accept it as it is." And rotate the fact-stating responsibility among everyone. I feel we are all mature and immersive players, and this sort of thing could actually work quite well. Or simply loosely outlining the main plotlines (such as saying "there is a staff conspiracy, someone does some out-of-control dealings with demons, there are some students mysterious mishaps" and stuff like that), and everyone can develop them as they see fit.<br/><br/>By now it could be somewhat obvious, but if not, then I'll spoil it.<br/><br/>I was playing Addler. I really had a great time doing so. I liked the relationships, and I felt that there was more potential for development in there...<br/><br/>I enjoyed the rivalry with Gaylord, and I liked the friendship with Emerson and Glorian. I did not relate much with Yakob and Iris, but I felt there was a chance for my character to interact with them sooner or later... As far as my character was concerned, there was more than what it appeared. Secret admiration toward Gaylord's strength of character, jealousy for Emerson, romantic interest for Glorian, slight rivalry with Yakob, deep empathy with Owen...<br/><br/>I really liked the part when we got stuck in the library. It sort of advanced the plot, and really established many personality traits for us, and allowed us to better develop the relationships.<br/><br/>Jason, I find it kind of interesting... For the way we pretended to play our characters at first, it almost feels like we "switched roles". I was going for the badass rebellious bastard, then ended up being this friendly and adventurous boy... Oh, and I did not simply ignore the thing about vandalizing my room. I just felt that after everything that happened that evening, adding one more thing was just kind of too much. And it would loose focus. That is why I maximized so much the tusk incident. Heh!<br/><br/><br/>So... I'd still want to play. I really enjoyed it, and feel there was plenty of potential. I'd play it again for sure, and I think we would do better now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142498/#Comment_142498" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T15:05:39+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  3:05PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that was a good call on your part.

Part of the fun of the game for me is in making up things on the fly, and then everyone acting as if they've known about them all along (Of course, on the other hand, there's a lot of fun in seeing something you've introduced in passing reincorporated in someone else's post).  There's also the issue of whether the wiki would be "in character" or not.<br/><br/>I'm not going to stop anyone from making such a wiki if they feel inspired to, but I guess I feel like it's not necessarily going to improve the game.  And I think (as Brendan and I discussed earlier), posts to the forum would always trump the wiki.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143010/#Comment_143010" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T04:22:48+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  4:22AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember spending a lot of time searching for posts where some name or another was mentioned in passing.

Although with everything in the forum, there's at least only one place to look.  Perhaps this could be tied to some kind of game mechanic thing?  People seem to be asking for some way to flag things that are important.  Perhaps a wiki is the way to do that?  <br/><br/>I guess part of my prejudice is that I'm really lazy about signing up for things and logging in and stuff.

Such as "this time it is Gaylord's turn to introduce a major subplot to the storyline, and everyone else should add something. He can't be contradicted as far as the facts go, and everyone should accept it as it is." And rotate the fact-stating responsibility among everyone.</blockquote>\nThis seems really cool, and also not too hard to do. Alphabetical by first name, first week of each month is when you get to start your bits. Admins could give an OOC whispered Ping! when it was our turn. That gives three weeks for some threads to wrap up before others unspool. I like how some could overlap, too. Say it's Gaylord's month, he introduces the Pipswilla, we spin off that, he wraps a few of those up, next month the next person might pike up a loose thread and run with it, or introduce a new subplot.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Here's my reservation about a wiki, and other such lists:  There are already enough barriers to play, without having a huge heap of canon to have to clear your post with before you make it.

Not just a lack of OOC banter or discussion of things, but even the lack of formal rules or anything. That said, it probably would help the game go smoother if we had such things. Hmmm.<br/><br/>I also have to admit the idea of IC whispers kind of strikes me as analogous to, in table-top, leaving the room with another player for Secret Plot. I mean, it's not quite as disruptive, given that other players don't even know it's there, but still, the idea that cool stuff is going on that you're not sharing with the other players. Maybe what we need are "fake" whispers, that aren't acknowledged IC, but can be read OOC? (Like putting a [Whisper: Glorian] in the topic or the like).<br/><br/>Also, if it isn't obvious from process of elimination, I've been playing Owen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143218/#Comment_143218" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T22:07:23+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 10:07PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>I agree with Simon in that a part of the original draw for me was the lack of ANYTHING that wasn't something a character said.

I like freeform, but at times it is kind of hard making things work if there are not even the most basic rules and limits. Now, I'm talking about very loose and intuitive stuff in here, so it's not something that should make anybody's brain to bleed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5723/professor-abalones-school-of-magic-now-open" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5723/professor-abalones-school-of-magic-now-open" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5723/professor-abalones-school-of-magic-now-open/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5723%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5723%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
