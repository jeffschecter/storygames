We want to establish a procedure to introduce these tools (mainly rewind/pause/fast-forward) for the con.<br/><br/>What would be a <i>good way to introduce the Safety Tools to the groups/players</i>?<br/>I can think of various approaches:<br/>- <i>Opening Statement</i>, i.e. "we are all friends" / "we all want to have fun and feel safe"  <br/>- <i>Select</i> Safety tools together  <br/>- <i>Rituals</i>, i.e. all press a safety button together  <br/>- <i>Real talk</i>, i.e. personal experience/position, get honest feedback from all players  <br/>- <i>Script</i>, i.e. to be read out in the beginning / go through procedure together  <br/>- <i>Impovise examples</i> together, i.e. each player presents example what would disturb them  <br/>- Open discussion/<i>brainstorming</i>, i.e. what would you like/what would disturb you (limits/lines&amp;veils)?  <br/>- <i>Visual aids</i>, i.e. tabletop tools, posters<br/>- <i>Wrap-up</i> talk, i.e. how was it for everyone?<br/><br/>Would love to hear your recommendations.<br/>best<br/>BeePeeGee                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486283/#Comment_486283" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-17T14:25:50+00:00" title="June 17, 2019  2:25PM">June 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So, my current recommendations, thenThis is work-in-progress af.
