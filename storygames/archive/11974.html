I end up giving my players and their PCs a pretty easy time of it, even when I try to set up a scenario that'll really punish them. Now, some of this stems from a lack of planning ahead on my part, as I tend to run my sessions prep-less, but for some reason, this game is kicking my ass.<br/><br/>Anyone have any generic ideas? Any methods of laying the hurt on their players?<br/><br/>Noah                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267712/#Comment_267712" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-18T20:39:08+00:00" title="April 18, 2010  8:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is just general GM advice rather than AW-specific, but any time anything goes well for them, I suggest chuckling an evil little chuckle and scribbling a note to yourself.

He reads the sitch. "What's my best escape route?"<br/><br/>I go, "Well, Dremmer's boys are vicious and opportunistic. Leave behind some of your wounded, and they'll go after the easy targets instead of the guys running away."<br/><br/>Fuckery.<br/><br/>Sammy, the Driver, is lying on a cold metal slab. Balls, the Brainer, has left, and Rufe, a guard, is watching over him. Sammy reads Rufe: "What could I do to get Rufe to leave the room?"<br/><br/>I think about it for a bit. "You could die. I'm pretty sure that would make Rufe go get Balls."<br/><br/>Fuckery.<br/><br/>In my face to face game, Tamerline, the hardholder, is negotiating with Nbeke, another hardholder. He just did a deal to upgrade his armory (buying the improvement) and almost idly, with one hold left on his reading of Nbeke, asks. "What does he wish I'd do?" <br/><br/>"Hmmm.

I had the opposite problem - I threw so much shit on my players that they started drowning in it. It was a chat game, and I have logs available, should you want to peruse them: <a href="http://apocalypsetear.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypsetear.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOff the top of my head:<br/>\n<br/>\nWolf, a gunlugger goes aggro on a random passerby, fails. Passerby takes the gunlugger's sawed-off off of him and fills his face full of lead. While he's laying there, bleeding, the guy takes all of the gunlugger's weapons, arms his gang with them, and leaves Wolfie boy to die.<br/>\n<br/>\nSavvyhead is working on repairs on a mental pacification device in a local bar. Botches a roll and his head explodes. Next thing he knows, he wakes up in a cage, with a homunculus attached to his head. The 'Keep of the bar was a dabbling surgeon/mad scientist, so he took a chance at a risky operation and then paid for the damage the savvyhead caused by selling him to local slavers.<br/>\n<br/>\nChopper eats some food from what's been strongly hinted to be a weird-ass creepy cult. Every once in a while after that, she gets to roll +hard - success means she gains some "beneficial" mutations that make her more predator-like ("eat unprepared meat to restore harm"), failure means horrible useless degeneracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDriver is forced to leave a car she loves behind. After a chain of events (same car is taken over by a tentacle-bot, driven to subway entrance, half-eaten by a subway god), she's forced to choose between: a) push the car she loves out of the way with her tank (another car), totally wrecking it; and b) probable death by evil brainer-possessed vehicle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis pretty much got my <i>players</i> to go "Man, I am going to see this city FUCKING BURN" at every possible occassion. I am pretty sure this is not entirely a good thing, but if you're on the mellow side of things, I guess I can give a few pointers:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Competent characters screw up worse - if a player made a character with a +3 stat and uses it succesfully at every occassion, that's fine - but when this guy screws up at something he normally does extremelly well, the failure won't be "Tough luck! Take 1-harm, try again.", but "OH MY GOD! YOUR FACE IS ON FIRE!".<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Hurt them when you're helping them. Sure, there's a medic in this city - but he's a crazy psychopath who'll take out half your kidney as payment as he's operating on you. Sure, you get out of the crossfire and crawl into that tank-car you just happened across - but if you want to drive it right now, you'll have to sit in the lap of the remains of its previous owner. Sure, there's a job in this city you could do - but it involves rounding people up like cattle for some really, really suspects purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Make a long chain of badnesses and whip them with it. Random acts of misfortune aren't too impressive - but you can take a random act of misfortune and make it matter. For instance, when I tell the Driver, on a open brain roll fail, that she forgot all of her childhood memories, and her player says "Woo! I got off easy!", I am sure to ask what her childhood was actually like, and when she says she and her sister mostly pushed other kids around for kicks, I am sure to include one of these wronged other kids into the game, seething with vengful anger and unrecognisable - because oh-oh... Someone forgot all their childhood memories, didn't they? Make little things matter, and they will stop being little things. If someone is walking around with a nasty gash in their head, that's not "2-harm" that will eventually heal - describe how the wound gets filled with dust and debris, how it keeps itching. If they ignore this, don't wrap it up somehow or clean it up - it doesn't matter that it's a 2-harm wound that's supposed to heal with time -, bam! Infections, terrible headaches, visions, the works.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) When you can't fuck with the character, fuck with the player - this is not really a general principle, but rather a response to a particular situation where a character is so notoriously bad, uncaring, unflinching, that he laughs at the suffering of others and pushes through whatever you throw at him with a smile. When this happens, you can't really affect the character - he's too far gone. Instead, show him how there's still hope and kindness in this world and how he's crushing it... Shake the player! Poke his nose into that shit he's brewing and tell him, <i>you did this.</i> ( Here's an account of where I did this: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=29116.msg271799#msg271799" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=29116.msg271799#msg271799</a> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267892/#Comment_267892" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T05:10:09+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  5:10AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, um, Noah...

I try to use the basic MC moves, but otherwise, I find myself falling back on my generic GMing style.<br><br><b>A recap of last session</b>:<br>The previous session, we'd decided to play with some of the ideas from the setting Deluge, primarily the constant rain and general degrading of everything. Having decided upon that, Sammy the Driver decided to set up a permanent camp and "cultivate" a hold, with the help of his partner Marshall the Operator. We'd skipped forward five or ten or something years, and they got a good thing going. In that time, Rue Wakeman the Gunlugger joins up. We start with a bad Wealth roll by Sammy, so I have some of his thugs attack civilians in the marketplace and then skip town, and at the same time assault one of the edges of the hold by a band of bikers. Shit goes down, and while losing the trail of the deserters, they fight off the bikers, capturing one for questioning. That brings us to last session.<br><br>A side note: Marshall's player is my father, and this is his first RPG'ing experience. I know, rough, but why not? He totally digs the apocalypse vibe, and having studied literature such as Faulkner as his focus in school, he's got the mindset just right. Only problem (and I use the word loosely) is that he likes to expound on the world around him and the other PCs to an extreme, such as adding NPCs wholesale to a scene. A little hard to keep up with sometimes. I've tried to instill some narrative control divisions, but they've not stuck as well as I'd hoped. He's stopped narrative what the other PCs do, though, so I think he can learn. :-P I think I'm gonna talk to him this week about it, but what's done is done.<br><br>We pick up where we left off: Sammy goes back to the tower where he and the gang reside, and sleep off the battle. Marshall, having been out on a gig, is heading home and (on Jon's narrative) meets up with 5 travelers, three guys two girls.He can tell (on Jon's narrative) that they're hiding something, so he keeps an eye out. They go back to the keep, and Marsh set's them up in a room with a guard. Next day, Sammy interrogates the prisoner, but he's resistant (bad roll), saying only some third party he never met hired out the biker gang from the major city-hub up north. Sammy decides to try again later, but comes back to find out the prisoner almost hung himself and is now unconscious.<br/><br/>Marshall decides he wants one of girls for himself, and while he seduces her into wanting to stay with him, he pisses off her man. The guy stalks out, and when Marshall follows, he pulls a gun on Marsh. An interaction followed that had us laughing for ten minutes:<br/>Noah: He pulls out his gun. "What the hell are you trying to do?"<br/>Jon: I say, "Think again about that gun." I had my guys remove the ammo last night, of course.<br/>Noah (rolling with it): Click click. "Damn." He reaches into his crotch and pulls out another clip, reloading. "Missed that one."<br/>Jon: "See that red dot on your chest? That's my sniper I had following us, just in case."<br/>Noah: So you're going aggro?<br/>Jon: Yeah. *rolls* 4.<br/>Noah: He shoots you. You take 3-harm, and you're unconscious.<br/>Jon: He can't do that! My sniper will shoot him! Does he get hit?<br/>Noah: You don't know. You're out.<br/>Jon (mostly joking): I don't think I like this game anymore.<br/><br/>*shrugs* With that anecdote, I think this thread is turning into a "Let's Help Noah Not Suck at GMing" endeavor. :-P<br/><br/>Noah                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267997/#Comment_267997" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T20:18:04+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  8:18PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Noah, <br/><br/>Make your fronts and remember focus on your moves and the principles! If you start to feel like you are not pushing hard enough then the moves will totally help guide you. Also feel free to take a few moments when you see an opportunity before you make your move, if you need to stall then vomit forth apocalyptic details to buy some time. That can also get your juices flowing! <br/><br/>And general good fuckery advice for both AW and really any game is when the players ask for something, give it to them. But before you give it to them, stop and think "what is the worse fucking way I can give them this thing they want? Why do they really want it and can I fuck with that?" Then like the book says get your bloody fingerprints all over it. <br/><br/>So to use your sniper example, awesome. Your player just asked for a competent sniper with a nice loaded scoped heavy rifle to be sitting in a good position... while he too is in the field of fire. You can totally work with that! Did you name the sniper? Once you have named him ask the player a simple and very leading question about why this sniper might possibly have a beef with him like - why have you not paid him this week? why did you fuck his wife? did you know that his son died last week during and/or because *insert player exploit x here*? Now the player has a sniper with a good reason to take a shot at him too... <br/><br/>Hope my rambling helps. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268000/#Comment_268000" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T20:45:27+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  8:45PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your father?

On a miss, you set it up, yes, but since then things you don't know about have seriously changed.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268203/#Comment_268203" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T18:07:35+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  6:07PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that move with my whole heart.
