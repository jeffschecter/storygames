                    Hey folks!  I'm new here, and was linked here from another community by folks who felt I would enjoy the discussions here.  I'm a long-time gamer who is just getting into less-traditional styles of tabletop roleplaying, and lately I've been looking to change the way my own games flow.  I'm rather new to the concepts of story gaming and conflict resolution, being mostly familiar with systems like 1st edition AD&amp;D, Rifts, Alternity, Savage Worlds, Shadowrun, D20, etc, but I am definitely looking to expand my gaming horizons.  Perhaps you folks can give me some advice.<br/>
<br/>
How would you suggest introducing "story mechanics" and conflict resolution situations into campaigns that are using established mainstream systems (D20, Savage Worlds, etc), without wholly switching to other systems?  I'm curious to give it a try, and hopefully slowly convert my gaming group to a different style of storytelling over time.  Currently, we are using Savage Worlds, and so far I've been allowing players to spend bennis to make actualy "meta" changes to the current in-game situation.  I'm guessing bennies would probably be the best way to implement more of this, but I'm curious to hear your suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I have an odd group.  They tend to like sticking to a single system, just so they don't have to learn anything new in the middle of a good game.  On the other hand, they like variety, and never really complain when I add new features and meta rules.  Suggestions?                </div>

                            If you want the main benefit of conflict resolution, just start hard-core house-ruling the stakes of your rolls.<br/>
<br/>
You're the GM, right?  So the next time somebody's doing the whole "I want to scale the wall, here's my climbing roll," just make the roll do more.  Say, like "Okay, if you win then you scale the wall before anyone sees you, if you lose then you get spotted while still on the wall ... that cool with you?"  Then make the roll, and go with the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
By getting people into that habit (which seems <i>so innocent</i>) you make sure that more rolls, succeed or fail, are driving events forward.  It's an easy first thing to do, and a terrific foundation for later techniques.                        </div>

                            Tony's got it, but I just want to offer some alternative advice!<br><br>I started off with SGs by tacking new ideas onto old games, too, but i'd suggest that if you can afford the cash to buy it and the session or two to run it, pick up one of the lighter hippy games, like Dogs in the Vineyard or <a href="http://zork.net/~nick/loyhargil/tsoy2/book1--rulebook.html" rel="nofollow">TSOY</a>, and take it for a spin, first. You can really learn a lot quickly by just diving head-on into the full experience of one of these games in action with your group - and then you might be able to better see how some of these notions can be used with the crunchy rulesets you know and love.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi, welcome, the usual caveat - if you and your friends are rocking out, think carefully before upsetting the teacart.  If you are the problem, trying to convert your pals to a new play style isn't the solution.  If everybody wants something different out of your gaming, then by all means push in new directions.  If you aren't sure - or they aren't sure - run some light pick-up, one-shot sorts of games (Dogs in the Vineyard is hard to screw up) that offer low-risk exposure to new stuff for everybody.  <br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday is a really nice game for showcasing stake-setting and player-driven fun without going completely hippie insane (I love hippie insanity too, but I play TSOY every week).<br/><br/>Other nuggets of goodness that are easy to incorporate are kickers and bangs, which make the GM's job easier and lead to engaging play  pretty much all the time.                        </div>

                            Hi and welcome, Nathaneal.<br/><br/>Those people above me are right: you'll want to look at techniques first and "gateway games" second.<br/><br/>There are many techniques you can introduce.  What Tony's talking about is a simple and effective way of turning task resolution into conflict resolution.  Another way of thinking about this is: instead of testing for success v. failure, you'll test for good v. bad consequences.  It's a pretty easy sell to players, because their characters will stop being incompetent even at the beginning stages of a game.  You also eliminate the "roll until you fail" trap.  Basically, you make every roll count in a good way.<br/><br/>The kickers and bangs that Jason is talking about are techniques described in the Sorcerer game.  Basically, a kicker is a way to set up the game in a way that drives the story forward.  It's the initial situation of a character that's loaded enough to provide fuel for the game.  Have you ever played the old Curse of the Azure Bonds game?  In that one, characters wake up to find colorful magical tattoos on their bodies.  That's a kicker, because now they have an initial event to fuel their actions.  They'll want to find out who did it, how to get rid of it, what it means, and so on.  The best kickers are the ones you develop together with your players.  Once a kicker is resolved, make a new one.  That way, your PCs are always driven and active instead of just going along for the ride.<br/><br/>Bangs are the high points of a game that provide the players with an opportunity to make meaningful decisions.  In an action-oriented game that deals with overcoming challenges, it's usually a combat situation.  In a "thematic" game, it would be a tough decision for the protagonist to make (as in, the Green Goblin dropping both Spiderman's girlfriend on one side and a whole group of innocent civilians on the other, and the hero has to decide which one to save).  Basically, bangs are events that you create specifically for a particular player and their character, drawing on what you know about them and what engages them.  In other words, instead of thinking about the game world in terms of how to best simulate a "real" place and pick the most likely thing to happen, you pick those events that, while still possible and plausible, are the most engaging for the players.  It requires being more proactive, in a way, about coming up with cool challenges or dramatic moments.<br/><br/>There are other techniques you can introduce into any game.  Aggressive scene framing is one, where you skip all the "We make camp" sort of actions and instead cut from one important scene to the next.  It can be taxing in a long-running game and takes some character exploration options away, but especially for shorter games it can be a great way to focus them.                        </div>

                            For fantasy games: Have them fight humans. And not "invading hordes", but like... highway robbers, mercenaries, civil war militia, deranged ex-Generals.<br/>Make them fight guys with families and the ability to communicate.<br/><br/>And then: make villains often get away. Give them some kind of speed or disappearing item, or feat, and allow them to keep coming back over and over again.<br/><br/>This is something that can make your game more rock-awesome regardless of whether they are into D&amp;D or trying new story stuff.<br/><br/>Because, if Captain Harrow of the Third Marsh Militia just <i>won't</i> die, and just <i>keeps</i> coming back with new men and stronger resolve, and pleading that you give up the [important McGuffin], then it's going to lead to cool conflicts and even cooler stories.                        </div>

                            Along with the Succeed/Good result, Fail/Bad Result thing that Tony and Xenopulse mentioned, you can also start farming out those results to the players a bit. Instead of always determining those, you can ask the player and the group what each of those outcomes should be and then pick from the suggestions. After a while, the players will start to do some of that themselves. My old gaming group and I started doing this without realizing it years ago with Call of Cthulhu and it worked pretty well, although we didn't do it consistently.                        </div>

                            I introduced TSOY's Keys and a modularized advancement-buy system into our 3.5E D&amp;D game instead of the XP system that was there, with excellent results.

You can play story games without related mechanics, which is probably what you're doing, but Nathaneal was specifically asking about mechanics that address a story focus.  And I assume you know the difference between conflict and task resolution?                        </div>

                            I've used player narrative in my DnD games for a long time, without really realising it. We'd go into combat and they'd roll to hit and I'd say "you hit but don't kill the dragon - describe what happens!" And off they'd go narrating the outcome of their conflict.<br/><br/>Also, relationship maps. Not really a story mechanic, but a good story game technique and something that can really help a campaign tie together and get the creative juices flowing.                        </div>

                            Every time I think I know the difference between task and conflict resolution, everyone tells me I'm totally wrong about everything I think I know. So the only conclusion I can reach is that I have no clue, none, zero, about the difference, and couldn't tell the difference it if I was stabbed with it.<br/><br/>I question the definition of 'story gaming' as attaching mechanical elements to story, but what the hey, we can accept it for this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Carry on.                        </div>

                            Nathanael,<br/><br/>I've been running Savage Worlds for various settings for the last year or so, and I've introduced a couple of funky storygame drifts into the mix.  I'm going assume that you know all about SW and nothing about any of the other games I'm going to mention.  Pretty much everything I've done to SW is stolen from somewhere else, and there are only two main "drifts" we use in my group.<br/><br/>We love Savage Worlds because it offers just the right level of crunch to be interesting without feeling fiddly, has a lot of flexibility and offers totally awesome throwdown tactical combat.  All in all it's a lot of fun for my group.<br/><br/>The main thing that I've been doing is the "declaration of intent" for actions.  This came about during a game where one of the players (Claire) was playing a very socially oriented character.  She usually plays the doublehardbastard type, but thought it might be interesting to give the social guy a try.  After the session, she expressed disappointment that the character hadn't seemed very effective because she'd tried a number of social interactions and they hadn't really panned out the way she'd wanted them to, even though she had done very well in her persuasion rolls.  After a while, we both realised that some of the other games we've played (like Primetime Adventures or Mortal Coil for example) are pretty explicit in the way they set out actions and tests: That is, whenever a player tries to do something, they <i>explain exactly what effect they are trying to create</i>.<br/><br/>So rather than the usual trad-rpg line like:<br/><br/>"I'll try to persuade him." *Rolls dice* "9, that's pretty good, what happens?" <br/><br/>you end up with players saying:<br/><br/>"I want him to think I'm some big shot from back east and worth talking to.  I'll try to use persuasion to get him to open up about what he's using the ghost rock for."<br/><br/>Basically, this just give you as GM a bit more information on what the players want and helps you make decisions on how to interpret their die rolls.<br/><br/>The second thing is stolen straight from Burning Wheel.  BW has a mechanic for something called Instinct, which are things the PCs will do in a give situation unless the player explicitly says they won't.  So "Always pack heat wherever possible" is a good example.  Any time it's relevant, that character has a gun on him without the player needing to state anything in advance.  But the <i>really</i> cool thing about them is that if the player wants to make life harder for his character he can say that, on this occasion, he's ignoring that instinct.  He's rewarded for doing so with a point of Artha, which is very similar to SW bennies.  For example, if the same character decides that on this occasion he doesn't have his gun with him, and that makes his life more complex, he gets rewarded for it.<br/><br/>Drifting this into Savage Worlds is great, because you already have the currency of bennies and the mechanic of Hindrances.  One of the things which never really sat too well with me about Savage Worlds was the way Hindrances works.  You get extra build points for taking them, but a lot of them are psychological and don't actually have any sort of mechanical penalty or instructions for playing them out.  This means that like a lot of games, players just take the Hindrances and unless they're really keen on playing them it falls to the GM to enforce them.  Like Curiosity, Greed, Loyalty or Code of Honour.  Personally I don't really want the hassle of enforcing stuff like that and don't really have the attention to spare.<br/><br/>Merging the two, I came up the following:  Players taking psychological Hindrances don't get any build points for doing so.  Instead, whenever they actually play one of them out in a way that makes life more interesting, complex of dangerous for themselves and/or other party members, they get a benny.  This has lead to the players driving that stuff themselves and made things more interesting for me as the GM. (Players surprise the me as GM = More fun for me)<br/><br/>Anyway, those are the two things I've embraced in my Savage Worlds games that have really made the game a lot of fun and less work for me as GM.<br/><br/>I know you didn't ask for this, but if I was going to give someone a reading list of storygames to read with the intention of drifting their rules into more mainstream games, It'd probably start off with Burning Wheel or it's younger brother Burning Empires.  It's quite traditional in it's structure (in that it has a GM and some players) but has a lot of really neat ideas like the Instincts I mentioned.  Definitely worth looking at to steal from (I'll probably never run a game of Burning Wheel, but it's probably one of the books I've gotten the most out of).<br/><br/>Dogs In The Vineyard is a very good one for a number of reasons, mainly because of the way it advises you to create towns/adventures.  If you've ever played Deadlands (and with the new Savage Worlds version, now is a great time to!) you'll see straight away that all you need to do is follow the advice in the DitV book to create a town for that game, then search and replace the word "demons" with the word "reckoners", add some monster from the Deadlands book and run it as a kick ass Deadlands adventure.  Dogs is a totally awesome game in it's own right too.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'd just suggest Primetime Adventures for the way it talks about setting stakes for conflicts.  That's advice which can be applied in any game really, just stop and ask the player "what exactly are you trying to achieve?" when they're trying to do something.  That book lays that out really well.<br/><br/>Honourable mention goes to Polaris for the great formalisation of getting other players to play the NPCs in a scene if their character's not present.  That works very well and is applicable usually independent of system, but Polaris does formalise it rather well in it's system.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope some of that might be useful.<br/><br/>I also mentioned a recent experience I had in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2422" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, which may or may not be of interest.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phasmaphobic</cite><br/>How would you suggest introducing "story mechanics" ... into campaigns that are using established mainstream systems (D20, Savage Worlds, etc), without wholly switching to other systems?</blockquote>
<br/>The 'Trust Mechanic' from The Mountain Witch consists of players allocating a number of chips at the start of each scene, to indicate how much their character trusts each of the other characters.  The number of chips acts as a bonus on rolls when the other character comes to your aid.  But it also serves as a vulnerability mechanic, giving the other character an advantage on rolls, should they suddenly betray you.<br/><br/>I think this could be added on top of another game system painlessly, anytime you've got a scenario where the characters Abosutely Need each-others' assistance to prevail; but also find it tempting to backstab before they get backstabbed.                        </div>

                            Another one I've used:<br/><br/>The Frateritas (sp?) mechanic from Thirty applied to bennies in Savage Worlds.<br/><br/>In Thirty, the players have extra dice which are awarded to them, much like bennies in Savage Worlds.  The difference is that the players can either keep them, or put them into a common pool.  If you put them into a common pool, this represents trust, teamwork and the camaraderie of (say) a squad of soldiers.  So if I put my benny in the pool, other people can use it, but that means there might not be any left for me when I need them later.<br/><br/>If someone does something to reinforce this (like risking his neck to save a team-mate) they earn an extra benny for the pool.  Betray that trust and they lose one.  Bennies in SW are a great currency, but you probably need to limit them and not refresh the pool for this to really shape player behaviour, but it's an idea.  I was going to use something like this if I ever run Necropolis or Tour Of Darkness.                        </div>
