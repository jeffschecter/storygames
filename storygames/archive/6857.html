You're adventurers, and you're deep beneath the earth. You should probably start at level 5, just to account for the fact that you're miles underground, and have disrupted the lives of countless beings behind you. There were plenty of bad dudes, sure: this isn't revisionist D&amp;D.<br/><br/>But, there was an earthquake, or maybe there was something terrible that you couldn't fight or understand and you ran. Whatever happened, you're lost miles underground and the way you came in - you don't even know where it is. And there's miles of pissed-off creatures behind you, anyway. Your adventure is getting home, and encountering horrible foes and unlikely friends along the way. I'd definitely have strange underground communities that need help from heroes, and man, do they have a bone to dangle: you need them to help you get out of here.<br/><br/>The focus would be on resource management, horror encounters, mental stress, xenophobia, and bonding with each other and, again, unlikely friends.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152575/#Comment_152575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T20:05:30+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  8:05PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As long as you include Drow, Aboleth, Duergar, Svirfneblin, and Kuo-Toa, it would be very hard to go wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152581/#Comment_152581" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T20:30:40+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  8:30PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "Linked Portal" ritual provides a great setup for this kind of campaign, too.  I really want to run an adventure that starts with the PCs finding the portal sigils of a lost temple or fabled Dwarven city, and teleporting "blind" to the linked portal with no clear plan for getting back.  <br/><br/>I think the idea of running a whole campaign that way is great though - lots of opportunities for weird politics, fantastic locations, and plenty of horror.  My one question is what you'll do about replacing dead party-members.  Recruiting new members from subterranian races could be cool (it'd be fun to be the one Drow or Duregar in the group, or whatever), but once the natives outnumber the aliens, the purpose of the campaign becomes a bit diluted - "wait, why are we looking for the surface again?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152589/#Comment_152589" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T20:49:01+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  8:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>Finding other lost adventurers from the surface is always a party-member replacement option.

If someone, say, needed the brainpan of an aboleth to heal their daughter who had the wasting disease, that would be great: they would push and encourage the party to go a certain way in order to run into an aboleth, and probably wouldn't want to tell others, which is dangerous and could end up sticky, but isn't the same as slitting someone's throat in the night, which generally is never cool in D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152632/#Comment_152632" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T03:26:53+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  3:26AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Six desperate adventurers are hired for a simple but terrifying task -- to descend deep into the earth and slay Lolth, the dreaded Queen of the Demon Web.
