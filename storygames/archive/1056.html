                    I thought that this was topical because of recent discussions of women's issues in gaming here. Apparently one Christopher Dyszelski, a doctoral candidate (or actual Phd) at the Univerity of Miami in Ohio has written a dissertation regarding women in tabletop RPGs. I haven't consumed it entirely yet, but I thought I'd post the link to it so other's could start reading and discussing it as well. <br/><br/>The abstract and a link to the text itself can be found here: <a href="http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/view.cgi?miami1146539391" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/view.cgi?miami1146539391</a><br/><br/>Mike                </div>

                            Thanks for posting the link--I haven't had a chance to look at it, but it excites me a lot.  I have been thinking and reading about James Hillman a fair amount of late, so to see a dissertation tackle rpg's with that direction in mind makes me all tingly with anticipation.                        </div>

                            I didn't care much for the writing style... but I appreciate the effort put intot researching this, and there were some very good quotes.  Here are a few I found noteworthy:<br/>
<br/>
On early RPGS...<br/>
Gaming Media Voice: While the individual elements to attract the Female Gamer were<br/>
now present in the games, literary references, getting into the role of the character and so<br/>
on, the games were still mathematics and violence heavy.  - The Slayerâ€™s Guide to Female Gamers<br/>
<br/>
Female Gaming Professional Voice:  I can only speak about the women I worked with,<br/>
but they tended to add a great deal more detail about social interaction between characters<br/>
and expanded motivational backgrounds for characters.  Plus, they added much stronger<br/>
female characters to the stories, making sure that women played crucial roles in the<br/>
products we published.  Most importantly, they usually refused to put cheesecake art into<br/>
their products whenever they could get away with it.  Luckily, we worked with a lot of<br/>
extremely respectful men, who noticed these things quickly and started incorporating<br/>
those ideas into their work as well.  As soon as there were more women around to voice<br/>
their opinions, the men would adapt and incorporate these elements moving forward.<br/>
- Cindi<br/>
<br/>
Female Gamerâ€™s Voice:  I think the White Wolf systems are very good at presenting<br/>
gender equality.  The pictures of men and women both cover a range of themes; though<br/>
the women may be â€œsexyâ€ in one picture, farther through the book, there will be a â€œsexyâ€<br/>
picture of a man.  Their wording and phraseology is very neutral, alternating between the<br/>
masculine and feminine pronouns.  Their advertising is similar to their book art; covering<br/>
a range of themes for both sexes.  I have thus far been very pleased to see that there is a<br/>
company out there that recognizes the importance of gender equality issues.<br/>
- 24-year-old who began playing in 1995<br/>
<br/>
Female Gaming Professional Voice:  ...the launch of Vampire: The MasqueradeÂ®,<br/>
which not only changed the way people played tabletop RPGs and introduced more<br/>
women to the game, but it greatly affected the way RPGs were designed after that.  They<br/>
certainly caused quite an upheaval at TSR, since most of our designers wanted to design<br/>
storytelling type games like White Wolf, which turned out to be the opposite of what our<br/>
(D&amp;D) fans actually wanted, causing significant decrease in sales.  - Cindi<br/>
<br/>
Female Gaming Professional Voice:  Itâ€™s the bodice buster romance novel of RPGâ€™s<br/>
- Samantha<br/>
<br/>
Female Gaming Professional Voice:  Women are far more political and manipulative,<br/>
for lack of a better word, in their approach to conflict resolution.  From what Iâ€™ve seen,<br/>
women enjoy a game more if they can resolve conflict through discussion, compromise,<br/>
or even trickery, rather than using weapons... Vampires focus on seduction, rather than<br/>
just feeding or combat.  I think women are very intrigued by the idea of a charismatic<br/>
being so strong and powerful that he can make you desire him with a single look.  - Cindi<br/>
<br/>
Female Gaming Professional Voice:  Wizards did not force D&amp;D to try to become<br/>
something it wasnâ€™t or force it down the throats of the wrong target audience.  We were<br/>
finally able to do real market research, find out who the audience really was, and then<br/>
make the products they wanted to see, which is one of the reasons 3rd Edition has been so<br/>
overwhelmingly successful.  - Cindi<br/>
<br/>
Numbers:  Both male (72% of men) and female (84.7% of women) gamers agree that<br/>
men pointing out and correcting gender equality will help gaming to be more gender<br/>
equal and less sexist.  Similarly 64.5% of male gamers and 77.3% of female gamers think<br/>
that women pointing out and correcting gender equality will help (Table 16).<br/>
<br/>
Female Gamer Voice:  Women see the scantily clad Amazonian warriors on posters and<br/>
just wonder why they would want to purchase such a thing; meanwhile the men are<br/>
drooling.  If you had an equal number of romance-novel covers to go with the babe-<br/>
posters, more women might realize that the games are for them as well.<br/>
- 31-year-old who began playing in 1979<br/>
<br/>
Female Gaming Professional:  Sex still sells...In most cases, I think gaming products<br/>
and advertisements today are better about presenting gender equality than many other<br/>
forms of entertainment media, especially considering that tabletop roleplaying is targeted<br/>
primarily toward young men.  Most products targeted toward that group go for the lowest<br/>
common denominator in their appeals...RPGs, for the most part, have moved away from<br/>
such appeals...In D&amp;D in particular, there has been a concerted effort to: include iconic<br/>
characters of both genders, use gender neutral language and to dress most characters<br/>
appropriately for their activities, rather than having female fighters slogging through<br/>
swamps or swordfighting in bikinis.  - Kim                        </div>

I suspect you meant that purely in terms of cheescake, but just in case it was meant more broadly, I must object.  I've a great love of books as artifacts, and if I didn't, I'd probably own more PDFs than I do.  The appearance of a book is an important element in my decision to purchase  it or not. It's a matter of taste, certainly, but I have no reason to consider it a problematic one.<br><br>-Rob D.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hm, you're right. I should have said "Judge Books based on how they look".<br><br>But then, books as repository of knowledge, rather than books as commodities, which is where the art and gloss go, as sale-drivers, rather than content enhancers. And I think "Pictures for atmosphere" should go away, and it's important to remember that RPG Books are a tiny segment of the book-trade.                        </br></br></div>

Beyond marketing, thinking about how the games inside books with non-traditional RPG artwork might be different is interesting. Particulalry when that artwork is from another genre that's very popular with women, non-traditional RPG players, etc.<br/>
<br/>
All About Romance has a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.likesbooks.com/awardpge.html#d" rel="nofollow">yearly Cover Contest</a> where people vote on their favourite romance novel covers in categories including Historical, Contemporary, and Alternate Reality.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For younger women, Manga and Manga inspired books are very popular.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Many indie comics are popular with women as well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I'll also point you over to Karen Healey's post on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.girl-wonder.org/girlsreadcomics/index.php?entry=entry060728-224052" rel="nofollow">the cover to October issue of Supergirl</a> - which I think is relevant to discussion of "fantasy" artwork in general.<br/>

                            Here's the thing Guy. There are enough RPGs available (here in the US at least, can't speak to Israel or anywhere outside the US), that people have to pare down what they even take the time to look at. I mean, you can't get a sense of what's in a RPG with just a glance. So, if I have ten RPGs in front of me, all adressing the same stuff thematically, and I decide to read only the three that look best to me...is that really a bad thing? <br><br>Further, while an RPG may be sensitive to female issues on the inside, while having cheescake on the cover, wouldn't you agree that it's not very likely? That is, I think that anybody who dismisses a game based on the notion that they're likely to be dissapointed by it, because the art indicates insensitivity isn't making a great leap. They might be wrong once in a while, but, as I say, if there's a product that looks just like it except for having more acceptable art sitting right next to the product in question? Why should they spend the time? <br><br>In this case I think it makes all the sense in the world to judge a book by it's cover. <br><br>Mike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Did you just pull out the "Oh <i>those</i> people are just looking for an excuse to pretend to be offended" trope? This is an invincible argument. It allows you to cleanly dismiss other people's positions as both frivolous <i>and</i> disingenious, and it saves you the trouble of engaging with the substance of their arguments. <br><br>Classy. <br><br>Somewhat ironic, considering that you're trying to make an argument in favor of substance over style.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think that a great deal of people make arguements based on form rather than content, yes.<br><br>And no, people aren't looking for an excuse to be offended, but they take something which might be offending(pulling the "I don't mind, but think of the kids!" trope) and other such things and blow them out of proportions.<br><br>Do I think that showing cheesecake without beefcake is somewhat wrong and sexist?

                            Hi! I'm not going to get into everything brought up in this thread, but I'd like to add that there's nothing wrong with cheesecake at all. In fact, sometimes I get paid to create cheesecake and I love every cheesy minute. <br>
<br>
But, if used, it should be appropriate to the subject matter. And, of course, as long as it's equal opportunity cheesecake! (says me, with the reputation of incorporating full frontal male nudity into recent games.) Tackling sexuality in art is good when it's called for. But it's not always called for.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Thunder_God, I will ALWAYS judge a book based on how it looks. Sorry, it's my job!                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm not going to jump on Guy here, but i am going to respond to the "away with pictures as atmosphere" notion, as it is pretty much the antithesis of my design philosophy.<br>
<br>
three of my favorite games are L5R, Nyambe, and Deadlands. I love these games because they have strikingly rich settings full of flavor, history, and story. I rarel if ever get to play these games, and when i do i'm often dissatisfied. You know why? Because in order for a play group to really utilize these games fully, everyone has to be up to speed on the content. You gotta read the book. Maybe if everyone lived in their moms basement we would all have time to read 250 pages of story, but in real world thats too much of an imposition. This is why i'm not playing the new Vampire, that book is fucking dense, and so tightly nuanced if you don't know it all the game gets boreing fast.<br>
<br>
Now a lot of indie games tackel this by going light on setting, thats fine. But there are other methods. I cite Luke's new Burning Empire's as a startelingly brilliant example of using art and "atmosphere" to convey important game information. The setting of BE is a deep and interesting one with a lot of facets. Rather then spend big chapters discussing it, that information comes out in things like lifepaths and skills and most importantly, the art. Without the art the game wouldn't have any flavor, any color. I attempt to a similar thing with my game Primitive. Luke is very good at this technique, but he is far from the first to attempt it.<br>
<br>
Art/Design is critically important. It doesn't just sell books, it helps you read and understand them. A picture is worth 1000 words right? Well elegant design is worth even more then that. All human language developed from pictographic interpretation, the letters of the major world languages are all basterdized adapted modified pictographic representations. Pictures and ideas are permanently welded together. To seperate them is possable, but doing so hamstrings both sides. There is a reason textbooks have pictures.<br>
<br>
Images, millions of images. Thats what we eat.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think there's something else worth questioning here: who are these people who are blowing everything out of proportion, perhaps pretending to be offended, deceiving themselves, etc? Are they a big problem here?<br><br>Just looking at the quotes that Stuart pulled, I don't see anyone <i>particularly</i> up in arms, or acting especially huffy and offended by anything, or blowing things out of proportion. It's more people saying stuff like, "If game companies don't do a woman-friendly production, no wonder women don't buy in much" and "White Wolf showed that they were trying to take women into account. And that got me interested." So I guess the more constructive thing to do is actually address the stuff that's there, rather than the mysterious, hypothetical threat of hysterically overreacting will o' the wisps. I admit I haven't read all the quotes in the dissertation, just the stuff in this thread; so maybe there are some people like that in there. But I think we're wandering into the danger of just constructing an imaginary group and then arguing about why they are or aren't right. <br><br>The concrete quotes, and the earlier reactions to them in the thread, are probably more useful to focus on. And turning back to the issue of appearances, some folks are indicating in the quotes that the visual representations matter to them: that visual representations in RPGs affect how these folks talk about RPGs, how they make purchasing decisions, and perhaps also how they play. <br><br>Should they? Is that a reasonable way to make these decisions? <br><br>I'm with the "visuals matter" folks on this one. Hell, I'll go you one more: I think the visuals are part of the <i>substance</i> of the books. They're not just "gloss" and "style." They're substantive and meaningful parts of how the book represents its subject matter. I think this both in general terms as well as in the particular case of sex, which can be done well and can be done badly. The images on the cover of an RPG, and the images inside, represent the game. The written words don't do that work alone. And what's more, the visual representations didn't simply wander by, trip, and fall onto the book. There was a design process of some kind involved, choices to be made, etc. Visual design and artwork presents and represents the game, and it contributes to the pool of resources available to players when they're actually playing the game. Some folks will make more and some less use of these visual influences in actual gameplay, but I don't think you can simply argue that visuals are (or should be) just irrelevant, or that they're just not substantial. You can argue it -- but I don't think we can just take it for granted. (And this is somewhat orthogonal to Mike's points, which I happen to find pretty convincing as well.) <br><br>I'll stop now and hold back for a bit, because I'm conscious of the danger of this becoming just a big dogpile on you, Thunder_God.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Doh! Totally missed the date. For some reason, the front page of Story Games presented me with a whole bunch of very old threads when i loaded it a couple days ago. Hadn't noticed that this was one of them. (And didn't notice any ofthem were old until i went to reply to a couple. Very weird glitch.)<br><br>-Nat                        </br></br></div>
