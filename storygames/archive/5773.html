And then there was some talk about how to be nice about it. Screw that. This is the thread where I am going to give a ton of criticism out about all kinds of RPGs that folks might think are sacred cows, or never get criticism or something. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to shoot for about a couple a day, and I can't possibly get too in depth. So I'll stick to the most obvious criticisms. Note that each critique should be viewed this way. Like, "Mike thinks this is the worst of the problems with the game, but he probably could come up with a ton more if he took the time to do so."<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see RPGs aren't just imperfect, they're all totally messed up. If/when I say that a RPG is "Good" or that I like it, I mean precisely that it's just less screwed up than others. As I hope I'll demonstrate. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129279/#Comment_129279" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:21:05+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's start with Sorcerer. If you don't know why I'm starting with Sorcerer, you probably won't get this thread. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon calls Sorcerer a "Vanilla Narrativism" RPG. Well, from another point of view that means pretty much that it simply does very little to support narrativism. I've leveled this criticism at it before, in fact. Mostly, in fact, this boils down to the system "getting out of the way" of narrativism. And not supporting other modes of play very well. <br/>\n<br/>\nExcept... well it's got this combat system. That's not to say that a combat system can't be designed to promote narrativism. Just that I think that they're rare. And Ron's is pretty damn traditional, in what it promotes in my estimation. Oh, sure, it's got some twists to how it works from traditional, but I don't think that any of them mechanically make promote narrativism play. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course we narrativism-biased players lean that way playing it. But give sorcerer to a gamism leaning group (even an open-minded one), and I think you'll very quickly get some pretty broken gamism emerging. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the "innovations" in Sorcerer combat are so convoluted that I've never seen a combat go without confusion. Not even when Ron is running the game. I think that they're interesting ideas, but I simply don't think that they really enhance the experience as they are now. When, in fact, not having a combat system would have done far more to promote the sort of play he wants the game to promote. To say nothing of a system that might actually promote narrativism. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's not the only rule that's confusing. Ron's version of an "Effects First" power system for demons causes people fits all the time. Many need a ton of explaining before people can even think of using them functionally in play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot to mention, if other folks are feeling like-minded, I think that they should join in the criticism. Somebody ought to rip apart Universalis, for instance. I'm probably a little too close to it to do it right. Though that's not at all saying that it can't be criticized. Lord knows it's a pretty messed up game in some ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129286/#Comment_129286" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:31:02+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:31PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 1:32PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs in the Vinyard<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this doesn't sound like "praising with faint damnation," but I'm not the most experienced with DitV. I don't even think I own a copy. And that's because my biggest criticism of the game is...<br/>\n<br/>\nMormon Cowboys? Thehell? Sorry, just a bit too post-modernly specific. And if the mechanics have been ported to so many other genres, it makes me think that the setting in question is really not all that specifically supported by the rules in question. And, if that's the case, I can only wonder if Vincent had reallly identified the genre his rules spoke to, if they wouldn't have been a lot better? <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and "Say Yes or Roll the Dice?" Fuck that. I say no all the time, without rolling the dice, and I'm right to do so. At the very minimum it's gotta be "Talk about it or roll the dice." Player tyranny is just as possible as GM tyranny. They don't need protection, they need to be appropriately empowered to have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I know that this is probably actually Vincent's intent. But it's not how the phrase comes off, is it...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Any responses to these critiques that are to become discussions should get their own thread.

You couldn't play the game having just read that, though; for starters, it glosses over Complications in two sentences, and doesn't really talk about Challenges at all except to say that they exist and there's bidding involved.<br/><br/>So, you come out of Chapter 1 going, "okay, sounds interesting, I guess all will become clear shortly." And then you get SIX HEFTY BAGS OF DATA DUMPED ON YOUR HEAD.<br/><br/>I was talking about this in whispers with Ralph, actually, over in this month's monster-thread-that-destroyed-Manhattan, because he brought up the question of what's so terrible about a game with a minimal text that then points into further discussion online. Uni Revised basically embodies that, but in one printed book; you have the minimal Chapter 1, and then a vast field of information to search through and hope that you glean the bits that are important.<br/><br/>I hate harping on layout in game books, but it must be said that the layout doesn't help matters here. Indeed, it hurts them.<br/><br/>Never has a game been in more dire need of a Quick Start Rules booklet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129295/#Comment_129295" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:39:52+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:39PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go, Mike, go!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129296/#Comment_129296" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:40:29+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Life With Master<br/>\n<br/>\nD4s where you don't count the 4s? Whothehell's idea was that anyhow? <br/>\n<br/>\nOh... mine? Oh shit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI console myself in that I think that I provided Paul with some options on this, and he chose the D4s. At least that's my story, and I'm sticking to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's wrong with this? It's basically got a relatively high handling time. People forget to not count the fours, and miscalculations are made. All in the name of having a zero-based system. There are better ways of dealing with the problem, even if I like the mathemetical elegance. Mathematical elegance often means zero in terms of how well a game plays. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the scene-framing rules... that's all Paul's fault? Only three types of scene? And two of them are really the same choices (violence and villainy). I'm not criticizing Paul's choice to constrain to the tight game he decided to constrain to. I'm saying there's got to be more possibilities. I think MLWM could have a ton more depth than is provided by the occasional "Horror Revealed" scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nInnocents... maybe I'm just lame, or forgot, but how come I never see them in play? Like not once in all of the sessions I've played of MLWM? If you're going to have these elements, shouldn't there be a way of ensuring that they get into play? <br/>\n<br/>\nI often see good mechanics laying by the roadside, beacause there simply is no point in the procedure of play where anyone gets asked if they want to use that mechanic. That's ghastly. Sure the designer can say, "but if you needed it, you'd have used it." But that just isn't true when we have needed it, and yet haven't used it. We're dumb, you have to remind us. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129299/#Comment_129299" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:43:49+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Mr Sugarbaker.

I could be wrong about that, however. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a very simple game, it has too many mechanics that do really the same things, increase effectiveness. Why not just have one method? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why call it a Poker mechanic when it seems to be more like a Gin Rummy mechanic or something. I mean, the idea of using a Poker mechanic in a Western game is to give the Western feel, right? So... if it's not Poker... haven't you really voided that concept? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn point of fact I've designed Poker resolution mechanics that do not vary from Poker at all (the difference is what you bet). I felt betrayed!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd... the rest of the mechanics just don't gel. Mostly because the devil mechanic really doesn't insert itself with enough assertiveness. Even when the player has it dialed up to high. And this is what's supposed to drive the rest of the cycle in theory. In practice it feels very jumbled up in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. people might start posting that they've seen me make these criticisms before. That's because I often have.

I love playing Polaris when I do get a chance, but it's hard to budget the time to play on a consistent basis. I think its distributed authority and negotiation model is awesome and would love to see it used in a game structured to be more short-game-friendly.<br/><br/>I think Mike's points about Sorcerer have a lot to do with why I never really got into it. In some ways Sorcerer feels like a link in an offshoot process because it is clearly going in the direction of a story game but retains a lot of trad characteristics. Birthing pains, if you will. This obviously is not to say that it can't be fun or that it doesn't have interesting ideas, but I personally found it more an item of historical and intellectual interest than something I would play. <br/><br/>My big beef with MLwM was that it didn't provide much for player involvement. The basic structure is like one of those sessions where the GM takes each player aside for a one-on-one scene at a time, resulting in an overworked GM and players who are bored three-fourths of the time. An adversarial model where the players could create each other's difficulties would have put a whole lot of zest in the game. Or a more cooperative model, where the players play each other's connections. Again, this was a transitional aspect in the design that I don't think helped the gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129340/#Comment_129340" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T14:22:21+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more for today:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnistat<br/>\n<br/>\nI can sum up my critique of Unistat thusly: I could do better in twenty minutes of designing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's nothing wrong with having a simple house system by which to freeform, more or less.

I really, really enjoyed the game.  I thumbed through the book, and found it to be attractive.  I already owned <i>Dust Devils</i> ("Revenged" edition) from the same author, which I had enjoyed reading, so I put Nine Worlds on my Christmas list and my husband got me a copy. I've been reading it on and off, when I have a few minutes.  Here's the thing: if I had read the book first, I would probably not have formed a good opinion of it.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's a pretty, well presented book with good layout, good fonts, and art that varies from technically good but not very evocative, to very good and very inspiring. On the minus side, the writing is not very tight, it's wordy, it has way, way too much setting chronology (28 pages on the war between the Titans and the Eternals -- 28!  I just don't bloody care, give me the final score!), the system is "weird" (meaning very unlike most games out there), and it uses a lot of jargon. In play, none of this was a problem: the newbie players got used pretty easily to the jargon because we only needed a small portion of it, the system actually worked well despite being unusual, and the GM boiled down the metaplot to a handy-dandy relationship map. I had fun, and the game felt completely different from the impression mere reading provides me.<br/><br/>But reading it?  I would never have got past the wordiness if I'd read before I played it.  It's hard to say things like that because I really like Matt and I greatly enjoyed playing the game.  But this beautiful little book needs to be ruthlessly trimmed by a professional editor.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129426/#Comment_129426" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T16:15:48+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  4:15PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>On the minus side, the writing is not very tight, it's wordy, it has way, way too much setting chronology</blockquote>\nIndeed.

Only three types of scene?</blockquote>\nI blame what came later. When I designed My Life with Master my play style was characterized by fluid scenes involving multiple player characters, a natural enjoyment of roleplay and dialogue without any particular hurry to use the resolution mechanics, and no particular concern for equitible apportionment of screen time. To my great frustration, it has subsequently become characterized by formalized stakes-setting, abrupt usage of resolution mechanics, and narration at the expense of roleplay. My Life with Master doesn't have three types of scenes. It has an infinite variety of types of scenes on top of five formulas for conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, fuck this thread. Because what this community needs is a status game of can't-see-the-forest-for-the-trees criticism?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>The basic structure is like one of those sessions where the GM takes each player aside for a one-on-one scene at a time, resulting in an overworked GM and players who are bored three-fourths of the time.</blockquote>\nThe forest that's absent from Mike's "open and honest" criticisms of Sorcerer, Dogs In the Vineyard, and My Life with Master is the way the rules provoke great game by manipulating the social landscape of play. The great part of Sorcerer isn't the dice mechanics. It's the way a GM acting as a demon on behalf of its interests, and Humanity loss and gain rolls treats the player character as a meaningful protagonist and the player as the author. The players aren't bored playing My Life with Master because of what the game knows about creating dramatic interest: when the players have a shared hand in creating an antagonist that represents a personal threat to all of their characters, there is no boredom when another character is in the spotlight.

Not by a long shot. Mike is ranting and saying negative things about games he likes to make some kind of meta point. Which is fine, I guess. Useless (to me, anyway) but whatever.

A lot of my complaints are, I will totally cop to, rather esoteric (apparently IAWA starts its text in the second column of the verso page 2, sharing the page with the table of contents!).  But as esoterric as my complaints may be, I still think they're justifiable and will cause problems (readers will be missing the beginning of the text, just like I did).<br/><br/>I'm not one of the brave, lonely few with insight and nerve.  I've one of the few that has noticed problems that nobody else was talking about.  The "few" part doesn't make me special, it's just reality: there are X people in the community, and a small proportion of X were noticing these problems.  And I thought I was going crazy and hypercritical and to be quite frank, I worried what it said about me as a human being.  It is <em>incredibly</em> heartening to find that there are other people who have noticed the same problems, and are not happy with them either.  That you haven't noticed the problems, or you don't think they're problems, doesn't mean they don't drive me up the wall!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129458/#Comment_129458" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T16:57:06+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  4:57PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><b>NO ONE IS ON CRAZY PILLS, GOD DAMMIT.</b></blockquote>\nTake a moment and chill, man.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>We have thoughts and opinions and we can discuss them with respect and understanding, right?</blockquote>\nWith that response, I question that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129460/#Comment_129460" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T16:57:12+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  4:57PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>If I might intercede for a moment on Ryan's behalf: At OrcCon last weekend, a half-dozen of us suddenly realized we all felt similarly about some topics that we'd never talked about online <em>because we thought no one else felt that way</em>.

When I designed My Life with Master my play style was characterized by fluid scenes involving multiple player characters, a natural enjoyment of roleplay and dialogue without any particular hurry to use the resolution mechanics, and no particular concern for equitible apportionment of screen time. To my great frustration, it has subsequently become characterized by formalized stakes-setting, abrupt usage of resolution mechanics, and narration at the expense of roleplay. My Life with Master doesn't have three types of scenes. It has an infinite variety of types of scenes on top of five formulas for conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Hi Paul!<br/><br/>Could you please post a longer version of this, in another thread, or in a blog post, or in a downloable pdf, anywhere, where I can send people with a link saying "Look! this is the way the game has to be played"?<br/><br/>Because a few weeks from now the Italian edition of My Life With Master will be published, and I know that a lot of people will assume that the game has to be played in a "choose a scene. Roll dice. Tell what happen. Next player, please" manner. It's the way I played the first times, until I found out that I enjoyed the game much more if I role-played the character more, without going straight to conflict. And until now I believed that it was only my personal preference, not the way the game should be played. <br/><br/>The game need a page that explain this, even if it's outside the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129466/#Comment_129466" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T17:02:23+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  5:02PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 5:12PM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>For this thread is it just to demonstrate that insiders can and do say harsh things about other insiders' games?</blockquote>\nThat is what I smell.<br/><br/>It is a Celebrity Roast for popular roleplaying games, by an average joe who is like the Brett Farve of game playing.<br/><br/>We have a thread made in jest at least once every quarter, that's meant to poke fun at our community.

Couldn't really get to the bottom of why, because no one in the discussion could show me a clear example of what GOOD Fun looked like (hoping that in 2 years a Replay culture will fix that). Later, I started getting it. I ran a fun game of it at Trinoc-Con back in 2002 or so. I described the session, only to be told that my Fun Was Wrong, Again, but even Worse this time! <br/><br/>When I relay this story over a beer and some goodhearted laughs (to me, the story is hilarious, not bitter or whatever), my friends laugh and nod sagely. They've been told loudly by Sorcerer enthusiasts on the Forge that their Fun was Wrong, as well.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b><br/>EDIT: WOAH WOAH OUCH COW CRAP!</b></span> I was typing this lazily as I thought I'd be the next post after Paul Czege's, but all this flamey stuff got dropped in the center. Sorry, this post from that perspective will look like I'm heaping on gasoline, but I assure you I'm not. This was my reaction to Ralph and Paul, as well as my own Celebrity Roast of Sorcerer.<br/><br/>PS: IIRC, I was the one that ran that game of Dread, Mike! I'm 90% sure: I'm the only one that brought copies, I think, but that morning was really haze because of experiences the night before (What happens at GenCon stays at GenCon...).<br/><br/>So, not mandating an hour chill or anything (good idea Eric! An hour of thought helps you think rationally and not passionately/with anger, etc). But let's continue to be generous in our readings. And treat this thread as a roast, perhaps? <br/><br/>I know Mike. We're not BFFs or anything, but I know his heart is full of love, and not bitter spite. Knowing that makes me chuckle and slap my knee when I read his roast above. If I didn't know him more, I'd be like, "What the fuck is the point of some bitter fuck trolling for Aggro Cred? CLOSED."

I think Ryan's feeling the rush of the New New Honesty.</blockquote>\nI think it's worth pointing out there was a cross section of the community there.  The group included published designers, unpublished designers, podcasters, people who seem to prefer the GM role and people who just play games.

The thickness of traits usually means you always get a chance to bring your character's personality into play and apply your character to the action; the fate points are the real limit. Or, looked at another way, fate points are really the mechanic; aspects are bribery that never lets you forget the character.<br><br>Edit: Now I realize, this isn't in the spirit of the thread.

I don't know a single game writer who can't take negative feedback. Most of them <i>crave</i> it. Sometimes a fan will go explodey and defensive, but so what? Hell even if the author gets all twitchy and weird about it, so what? That is not a reason to be silent.<br><br>Insecurity, fear of rocking the boat, fear of being seen as an outcast, whatever... it ain't easy but that stuff has to be dropped -- with extreme prejudice. And everyone else has the duty to stay committed to open ears and understanding hearts -- welcoming all the voices. (And yes, including Mike's ranting here. That too.)<br><br/>If you are strong and really believe what you believe, then you don't have to fear someone else's take on it. I know that I love Play Unsafe. Someone saying that it sucks doesn't hurt me, and I doubt it even hurts Graham much (or at all). If you have something that you are dying to say, please say it. If you want to stay positive, stay positive. If you need to be honest and say what's not working, then say that. That's what we do here.<br/><br/>Does that sound too pat and simple?

This thread has strongly affirmed my message -- of criticism in private first, of mindfully moving criticism to the public venue in a way that manages the context carefully (or, at times, better keeping that criticism private),  and of making sure that criticism in public is done in a way that minimizes emotional response out of shame and other bad feelings.

At first blush, I can't.  My "meatspace" reaction is to get tense, bitchy, hurt, angry, and acidic.  But I've trained myself not to let other people see that.  I hide it, hopefully from myself, and *force* myself to listen, *force* myself to realize there's value in there that my emotions won't let me see, *force* myself to say thank you in advance of that.   My inner demon wants me to hurt the critiquer back, as viciously as possible.  But the skills I've learned, the other part of me I like and want to be, pulls me back from that.  It's more work than I care to do a lot of days.  But I do the work because I have to, because I recognize that pushing negativity back at negativity only creates a feedback loop that will deafen the discussion.<br/><br/>And honestly, I don't think I'm alone (even if I'm not, my very existence gives the lie to your assertion).  I think the community likes to self-congratulate on how good it is at taking criticism, but most criticism <i>fucking hurts.</i>  It saps joy.  It doesn't make me want to make a better game.  It makes me want to take my dice and go home.  Only when I get PAST the emotions of it do I start to find the ability to build.<br/><br/>I only take criticism well from people I've established a strong, personal, direct trust relationship with -- and even so, back in the days of Spirit of the Century's development I got so frustrated I yelled at Rob, stalked out of his house, and left the project for something like five months.  But I've learned from that.  <br/><br/>Anyway, criticism.  EVENTUALLY, I find the value in it.  I especially find the value in it when it's done direct, personal, and best of all off the fucking internet and in person.<br/><br/>But ON the internet, honestly, most folks who deliver critiques have absolutely no skill for doing it in the way that one human looks after another, even when they think they do.  Jason Morningstar talks about the right way to do the criticism is "with love".  And I agree with him, that's the right way to do it.  But how do you do that when you're doing it in text, in public?  For me, "with love" is a mode that can only operate in a personal connection.  I don't get that in a public venue.<br/><br/>It's a lot like a situation where I'm standing around with my fly unzipped.  I deserve to be told about that -- there's a need for criticism about my wardrobe choice and/or malfunction, there.  The right way to handle that, first, is to walk up to me and quietly say, "Uh, Fred... your fly's unzipped."  You've watched out for me there but you've also given me the bad news.  I can act to correct it.  If instead, you go and find the local public address system, flip on the microphone, and announce to the whole convention "FRED YOUR FLY IS UNZIPPED", I'm going to think I need to murder you in your sleep.  Same message.  One context makes it a positive statement of you caring about me.  The other makes you an asshole, and turns the actual value of the message to shit.<br/><br/>Trust is the only way to overcome the intense harmful nature of public internet discussion, if you ask me.  And you have to build trust privately, personally, directly before you can take advantage of it in a public venue.  Though it CAN be built through certain public persona techniques: there is such a thing as "being a calm, trusted voice" in public.  But you've got to work at that, constantly, and you've got to be good at it.  Most folks who want the atmosphere of criticism here have not put in the work, and are not good at it.<br/><br/>Exceptions will always exist, often due to an aggregation of the factors I'm talking about.  I feel I have a strong personal trust relationship with Paul Tevis, for example, and it rides on the back of the feeling of trust he created in public, in advance, with his podcast and general mode of behavior online.  Which helps with the critique he gave of Spirit of the Century above.  Paul also has mad skillz in the department of delivering the bad news with a spoonful of honey (he made sure to create a fuller context of the game, in fewer words than Mike used in nearly any of his possibly-grandstanding critiques above).    Mad. Skillz.<br/><br/>And at the end of the day, most of the rest of you just don't have those same advantages.<br/><br/>And if you're getting your dander up about this message, stop for a second, and think: how much of that is because I'm delivering the bad news about the community in public, on the internet?<br/><br/>Sure, it was a cheap and easy thing to do.  Posting to the internet's one of the lowest effort activities there is.<br/><br/>But it probably wasn't the best.<br/><br/>Folks like to talk about how the rush to publish is bad for the scene.  I think the rush to critique in public is just as bad.<br/><br/>Slow the fuck down already.  Take it in stages.  Connect to the developers directly, first; hash out the problems.  Build confidence on both sides of the interaction that the critiques have merit, and have been thought through enough to be WORTH public consumption. <i>THEN</i> move on to taking it public.<br/><br/>But rushing to get that crap out the door?  That's just mental diarrhea, folks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129515/#Comment_129515" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T18:07:25+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Fred, I get you.

Nice critique. Thanks.<br/><br/>I wrote a game called Dread. It was received well by some, and badly by others. There have been two fairly negative reviews. One of them was posted by you, Mike, just now (and let me point out that I'm only referring to the new edition of Dread, since the old edition was, like, six years ago, and most people thought that it was pretty iffy at best). Anyhow -- DOZENS of people have played my game.<br/><br/>I also wrote this one video game, a few years back. It was played by a FUCKLOAD of people. Like, maybe half a million?<br/><br/>It was reviewed all over the place. Some of the reviews were good. And I put their quotes on my resume. <br/><br/>Some of those reviews were bad. And there was much vitriol, and scorn, and contempt, and gnashing of teeth and rending of garments. Some of the critics were pretty fucking brutal. They hated the AI. They hated the interface. And some of them really hated the story and dialogue. Which I wrote.<br/><br/>But, I drank a fucking beer and I started work on my next game. Why? Because there's no point to doing anything else. You listen to the good, and it makes you happy. You listen to the bad, and you make a list of things that you can do to improve the quality of your work in the future. But you sure as hell don't get angry or sad. And if you start to feel pissed off, you hit the gym or you listen to some good music or you watch Predator on DVD or whatever.<br/><br/>I don't get emotional about it, because there's no percentage in it. I used to. When I was in college, and some creative writing professor would spill red ink all over a short story that I wrote, I'd get frustrated. Then I realized, either it's good or it's not. Feelings won't change anything.<br/><br/>There's this scene in this episode of The Wire where this one sociopath says to his victim: "You want it to be one way. But it's the other way."<br/><br/>And that sums it up for me. No matter how much we talk over the issue, at the end of the day, if you put a creation on the street with a price tag on it, some will find that it was worthwhile, and others will be disappointed. Name the best movie you ever saw. Someone out there hates it. Name the worst movie you ever saw. Then do some googling and you'll find a fan page.<br/><br/>There is no way to avoid criticism when a creative work is made available for purchase or consumption. You might decide not to criticize someone's game. But other people will, and you might not like what they have to say.<br/><br/>There is no way to avoid hurt feelings when criticism is applied to a creative endeavor. You might have rhino skin and shrug and drink a beer and start working on your next game. But not everyone is going to react that way.<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything that can be done about it. That may sound like apathy, but I think it's just a statement of fact. There are a lot of people on this site, and there isn't going to be any consensus on an issue such as this. I don't know if you can even convince people to just 'agree to disagree' and drop it.<br/><br/>But I do know this:<br/><br/>I'm not really a story gamer or whatever. My game, as noted, is kind of traditional. I feel like a welcome outsider here. I felt the same way on the Forge. Just hanging out, observing, sipping a brewski in the corner. Everyone's nice to me, I get to hang out here, and occasionally throw in my two cents once in a while. <br/><br/>So.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, one of the most valuable things that a site like this can provide is a sense of community. That sense is fragile, and must be nurtured. It can easily be undone. It is very easy to respond to someone's post in the heat of the moment. It is very easy to forget that you can just shrug and say fuck it. It is very easy to take offense, and to give in to the need to retaliate in some way. <br/><br/>This shit can go one of two ways; it can serve as the precusor to evolution, in which case you can later dismiss all the rancor as growing pains, or it can serve as the precursor to dissolution, in which case you might interpret all the flaming and bile as red flags.<br/><br/>Now, you might say that I just posted a criticism of this thread. And maybe I feel a little guilty about doing that, because I might have hurt someone's feelings. But I promise you that by the time I get to the bottom of this bottle of Negra Modelo, I'll have forgotten all about that.<br/><br/>Peace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129631/#Comment_129631" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T01:58:01+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  1:58AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 2:09AM by chadu.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>Oo, oo, oo!

I mean, he came right out and said he loves all of these games. He also took some big digs at himself. (Here, I'll take a cheap shot myself: "Mike, let me ream a game. I'll start with Sorcerer in Space...oh, but wait, it's never actually been published, has it?" Oh, snap!)<br/><br/>Having played with Mike, let me share a typical Josh-Mike exchange about gaming.<br/><br/>JOSH: (enthusiastically) Hey, Mike, we should totally play this new game that people are raving about on the Forge!<br/><br/>MIKE: (cranky &amp; curmudgeonly) Aw, that game? I read through the rules, and some of the mechanics are a bit off. Mathematically, the resolution mechanics don't curve right.<br/><br/>JOSH: (spirits dampened) Oh, so you don't want to play it?<br/><br/>MIKE: No, I'll play it. Let's go!<br/><br/>(We play game. We have a lot of fun.)<br/><br/>I think Mike's point is this: every game, no matter how much fun it is, has some cracks and weak spots. Mike likes to focus on those, sometimes quietly to himself, sometimes loudly to everyone. It doesn't mean he doesn't like the game. It doesn't mean he thinks the people who like it are stupid. He's not the RPG Pundit, claiming everyone who doesn't see things the way he does is an idiot or a poseur or a scam artist. He's not being malicious or spiteful. He's playfully pointing out what he thinks are cracks in an otherwise seamless game, and inviting everyone else to point out the cracks (including his own).<br/><br/>Show of hands: how many people here have posted on the Forge that Sorcerer needs a new edition, with more explicit instructions and/or tightened-up mechanics? But Mike points out some flaws in these games--in a playful, self-deprecating, tongue-in-cheek manner--and he's being an asshat? Huh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129683/#Comment_129683" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T07:36:28+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  7:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread hurt my eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129684/#Comment_129684" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T07:37:17+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  7:37AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Mike, you never got back to me about Juiced Rider, for shame!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129819/#Comment_129819" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T15:24:21+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  3:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on crazy pills.<br/><br/>Keep them coming Mike.

Note that I still don't like having to have done this thread. And I, perhaps most of all, think that the thread is stupid... or, at least that the need to have the thread is stupid. Paul is right to call this thread bullshit. <br/>\n<br/>\nJosh Neff, unsurprisingly, figured me out entirely. He knows that what I'm doing here is demonstrating a side of myself that, apparently, some people have not seen. Story Games is a relatively nice and quiet place. I've never felt a real need to do as much criticism here as I did when I was on the Forge. But that's not nearly the same thing as saying that I am some rabid fanboy unable to see flaws in works that I otherwise admire. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I suggest HQ for somebody to use to play, I could add the following disclaimer: HQ is not perfect, not nearly, and you may have to do some substantial interpretation in order for it to work the way that I think works best, or in any coherent way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's the micro version of the disclaimer. To be really accurate, I could go on and on and on about precisely what the potential pitfals are in playing the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I've done that already elsewhere. Do I really have a responsibility to include all of my critiques of every RPG that I've ever written every time I talk about any RPG to avoid coming off as a ravening fanboy? If I over-prescribe HQ just because it's my favorite game (despite it's flaws), doesn't that just speak to my own personal biases, and not a dismissal of other RPGs? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it incredulous that folks think that we are unthinking fans. Given how much critique we have done of these RPGs and others. You haven't seen those (much better written than here) critiques? So you assume we all think that every RPG on the "indie" list is perfect?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, again, that's what's forced this thread. I can't believe that I'm having to "prove" that I'm not a fanboy by regurgitating versions of criticisms that I've posted in other places. Almost every criticism you see from me above is a paraphrase of a much longer criticism I've made of the game in question on the Forge, or somewhere else. In some cases out loud at GenCon speaking to crowds of folks gathered to talk about game design. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a community we don't just value criticism, it's a part of the entire ethos of the system. You put your game up on a site for folks to see, expecting it to get disected and questioned to the Nth degree. And then you take that feedback, and try to use it to improve the end product. Both pre-playtesting, and then as a result of playtesting, you get this feedback. And then, once the product is out, you wait for actual play posts, and you use the feedback there to assess what you did wrong with the game, so that you can either revise if you so choose, or at least you can avoid making the same mistakes in the next game you design. And so that you can put out some words of advice on how to avoid the pitfals that your game creates. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Because at some point you have to shoot the engineer, and begin the project - else we'd never see games finished). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... I've said this before. But, apparently, some people needed to see it for themselves. They weren't going to feel that they could be part of the community until they saw that we weren't "crazy." <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, let me gently suggest that next time you perhaps go and ask us about our criticisms of some game X. Or, heaven forfend, go look up what we've already written on the subject so that we don't have to write it again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worst part of this thread is that, now that I've revealed it's purpose, I'm sure it's going to look like some farce purpetrated in order to hide the "fact" that we really ARE rabid fanboys. The conspiratorial will see disingenuity in this. The Pundit, should he bother, will have a field-day with this. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I hope it's been worth something. That somebody is now convinced of our values. That the point is made. But now that we've gotten this far, I quit. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don't quit with criticism, I quit being forced to convince others of my own integrity. If you want a criticism of a game, here's an idea: ask for it, or start a thread on the subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, when nobody asks for a criticism, it's just unlikely that there will be one. Why say bad things about a game if nobody is likely to do anything with that feedback? How does that improve anything? Note that I dropped off Fred's list for FATE a while back for two reasons. Largely because despite him not really asking for it, I had dumped a lot of criticism of FATE on that list. And, second, because I finally got it through my thick skull that it tended to really bother Fred. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn't make Fred a bad designer or anything (hardly), it just makes his and my styles somewhat incompatible. I actually completely understand Fred's responses. I don't expect designers to be completely dispassionate about criticism that they get. For my part, for instance, I reacted quite defensively to a lot of the criticism I got from playtesters for Universalis. I think I worked around this eventually, for the most part, but I also think that the game probably suffered somewhat for my arrogance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm far from perfect in these matters as you can see. I'm not holding myself up as some paragon of how to do these things. Perhaps I could be more sensitive, too. Whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is not that it's a perfect process, but that it's the process that we hold to be the ideal. That of giving and recieving criticism. More importantly that we are not some cult of personality that all fawn over each others designs uncritically (or, according to the Pundit, just a mutual admiration group set up to promote each other's sales). <br/>\n<br/>\nShreyas likes this thread because it is effectively, as Ralph points out, at this late date nothing but iconoclasm in truth. We shouldn't have to prove anything to anyone, Ralph is right. Shreyas, believing that iconoclasm is good for iconoclams' sake, would like to see more of it (and I understand that perspective too, at times). But unfortunately this thread wasn't for Ralph, or for Shreyas... at least not my reasons for having it. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo anyone disillusioned by my work here, well... I am the asshat. Always have been. Somebody has to full that role. I guess it has to be me. I could apollogize, but will that help?

If I'm going to play a game about redemption, I'm going to need mechanics to support that. In Nomine even has some. Maybe I missed em?

In other words, if you thought a game was uncooked, it was your responsibility to publicly criticize it, being harsh *but fair* in your critique, rather than saying, "That person is a Community Elder, so I'll swallow my criticism; even as I see people purchase said game, and post followups about being unhappy with the game or finding it unfinished."<br/><br/>It was an... okay... idea? In theory? But ultimately, the movement was a failure: Public aggression just turns everyone off. Makes people enemies, even when they're not fighting each other but over ideas. A lot of the "givers" of feedback couldn't "take it". Empathy overcame, and people understood -- finally -- that having something you put time and effort into, attacked in public... <b><i>hurts</i></b>.<br/><br/>Still, this thread, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpFzGpUlJ2M" rel="nofollow">Stand-Up Comedy style Roast</a> (loving the games, and bashing them all the same in the spirit of a good send-up) by Mike was pretty funny. It would not have been funny if he didn't love the games, nor their designers, and was just being a cruel dick for LOLs.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a piece of history, a bone excavated from 5 years ago. And a reminder why Aggressive, Harsh Public Criticism of Personal Works of Creation isn't really a solid foundation for a movement or a community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407220/#Comment_407220" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T13:16:39+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  1:16PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I really appreciate about these forums is the prevailing tendency for people to give deep, challenging, fair criticism that's still constructive, supportive, and friendly.

The problem is that negativity doesn't really solve anything, is silencing, promotes people not making games rather than people making better games, and just creates a bad vibe around games and game creation.<br/><br/>I think it's been proven many times that the best solution is to talk very excitedly about the games you do think are really great and to "be the change" in terms of making the kinds of games you want to play. Otherwise, it's really easy to just be a hater and criticize folks for attempting the hard work of game design and production without contributing yourself. This isn't to say that you shouldn't question or criticize games, but it's really poisonous to take a stance like "this game should never have been published" or "this game shouldn't exist" rather than promoting the creation of more things (which inevitably involves mistakes and imperfections and just games that you subjectively don't care for). It's super easy to say "Hey, so I played your game and I think my group might enjoy it more if we did X instead of Y" (and even make a hack of the game that does that) instead of the entitled and negative "This game sucks; obviously X should be Y."<br/><br/>Really, this is true of indie games folks complaining about D&amp;D too, so I guess I should stop that (guilty).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407516/#Comment_407516" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T15:49:24+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  3:49PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite right:<br/><br/>If you have issues with design, look at solutions and show by example.

I mean sure, let's protect the precious feelings of game creators but once they charge money for something they open themselves up to criticism. I hate buying a game that's been hyped up to no end only to find out I wasted my money on something I would never be able to use. A critical voice is essential to avoiding this problem and I think I care more about the feelings of someone that lost money than someone that lost nebulous feelings of creative accomplishment.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'll respect your feelings if you can respect mine. I hate feeling ripped off by the unwarranted positivity of internet anti-critical culture. I don't have a huge disposable income, wasting my money on shit hurts me more than negative thought on the internet hurts a game designer. I would rather warn people away from things I don't like than give the creators of things I don't like a pep talk about doing better next time.<br/><br/>(Don't suggest that I should 'be the change', not everyone has the luxury and privilege of so much free time that they could design, playtest and publish a game)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407545/#Comment_407545" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T22:01:35+00:00" title="February 27, 2013 10:01PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2013 10:02PM by Callan_S.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans_c-o, Depends if Valamir missed it to?

I can't follow it, because I love buying games first then worry about playing them later. :-)<br/><br/>But the middle ground? That's easy: Actual Play Reviews. Reviews of a game not based on how pretty they are, but how they played out.<br/><br/>That's a super positive way to give criticism, even if the feedback is negative! If you didn't have fun with a game after playing it as-is out of the box, write about the experience and give details as to what worked and didn't. It will help people like Tulpa (and Me!) decide if the game is right for us. And like all reviews, I can go into a review and realize that what "That Person Doesn't Like, I LOVE!": I might pick up a game that someone else game negative feedback in a solid play review. Likewise, I might say away from a game that has poitive feedback from a solid play review, if I understand the player has interests that lie far away from my own (which happens sometimes between me and Jason! Okay, maybe A Lot Of Times!).<br/><br/>So if someone wants to bag on a game, the most positive way to do so is to play it, and say what you liked and didn't like, speaking to an audience of potential other players. <br/><br/>A negative way to do it is to look at the press page or website and just slag the game, in a way meant to score points with your friends, or show how awesome and smart you were for deconstructing a game you never touched before.<br/><br/>That's the middle ground I think Tulpa is looking for.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407590/#Comment_407590" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T08:57:03+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  8:57AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tulpa, you're someone after my own heart, really. I've published two things in the last 10 years partially because I hold myself to a really high standard and don't want to feel like I'm ripping people off. There's a lot of stuff that people publish for money that's not very good or just pretty inconsistent, from both the big companies and indie publishers. And it can be hard to find the good stuff. A lot of times, individual groups and GMs feel like that have to hack the rules to make something functional, rather than to adapt it to the game concept they're interested in playing. <br/><br/>Personally, I don't feel like a culture of criticism would change things very much. I mean, RPGnet reviews tell me basically nothing interesting. Likewise, most video game or board game reviews. Unless I can get my hands on it and read/play it myself, I'm not sure how to tell if a game does anything that I find useful or not, and whether it seems like it will do it consistently, except word of mouth from other people that I trust. Their criticism matters a lot to me, where general criticism doesn't seem very useful. A lot of people heap praise on games they haven't played or where most of what makes the game work is stuff they're doing rather than stuff the game makes happen. Likewise, a lot of folks heap criticism on something when they haven't really engaged with it or taken the time to understand it. But there are folks who are more careful and thoughtful and those people are worth their weight in gold, definitely.<br/><br/>Still the New New Criticism was mostly about how game designers should treat the work of other game designers, not about rejecting criticism from customers. Basically, it was about whether we should give each other "tough love" or try to be a supportive and welcoming community for each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407592/#Comment_407592" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T09:04:32+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  9:04AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does seem like it should be possible to provide negative feedback in a constructive manner that respects everyone's differing opinions.

Positive and negative. It helps me grow as an artist to know how other people view my work.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean I have to change what I make based on everyone's varied opinions. I take what feedback helps my work be better, and try to apply that. You can't make everyone happy, nor should you try. I make things for myself, and I hope people enjoy them as much as I do. If I was designing for everyone else, I'd be in, I dunno, marketing. I'm not here to trick you into buying things I make with clever advertising. I'm here creating something from the heart and hoping other people love it as much as I do.<br/><br/>I view game design through this lens too. I haven't designed a game yet, but I hope that when I do people who like my ideas will like my game! I'm sure 80% of the rest of gamers don't have to like it, and I'm not going to convince them to. <br/><br/>There's a difference between objective critique and subjective taste. For example, I might not subjectively like Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup Can print, but I can objectively appreciate it's importance in visual and cultural history. I feel the same way about D&amp;D. I might not subjectively like D&amp;D as a game, but I can see why its popular and objectively appreciate its importance in my hobby.<br/><br/>It's important to recognize your taste, and play and buy and create toward that. Actual Play reports and reviews and playing games at conventions and reading sample PDF's and watching Kickstarter videos are all great ways of determining if you like a game or not. I feel like there's plenty of positive and negative reviews of games on the internet.

I would say that there are four different kinds of responses:\n<ol><li>Short judgements. "I don't like this."</li>\n<li>Personal preferences. "I don't like rolling attributes."</li>\n<li>Corrections. "But it says on page 77 that..."</li>\n<li>Improvements. "I would like to have this on the character sheet."</li></ol>\nWhere it may seem good to get responses like 3-4, it's in points 1-2 you get an understanding of what kind of players that will like your game. You can get a deeper knowledge when the first point happens by asking more questions about how the player would change the game to like it and what games that person likes. The second points tells you that you failed somewhere to explain what the game was about. You also learn when different implementations in your game mechanics break how it's traditionally done, and how people will greet that.<br/><br/>That is something I learned from my first game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407677/#Comment_407677" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T08:42:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2013  8:42AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think having Actual Play be the home for criticism here on story-games is a brilliant choice.

Would I be out of line if Eclipse Phase was being talked about and I posted about how its complicated enough to be a deal breaker for a lot of people in a general discussion thread rather than actual play?
