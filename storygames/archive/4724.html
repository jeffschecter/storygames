I'm not going to have my entry judged (as contest organizer), but I want to go through the creative exercise.<br/><br/>I've decided to do the second category of the contest: designing a comprehensive marketing plan for a non-existant game.<br/><br/>Here's the pitch for  the game:<br/><br/><i><b>Angelic Pervert </b>is a game of Hentai exploration. It is a game that allows players to create stories of epic sexual obscenity, involving their own kinks and curiosities into the fiction. The structure of the game (especially Bits and Squicks) allows players to strike the fine balance between hardcore hentai exploration and personal boundaries.<br/><br/>The most interesting parts of the game are the Squicks system and how Dominance is calculated for characters in scenes. If you're into tentacle-lashing, demon-worshipping, catgirl-featuring hot sex, then <b>Angelic Pervert </b>is your game. If you're into empowering the lolicon characters you portray, and have a major issue with how some H Anime portrays women's agency, then <b>Angelic Pervert </b>is still your game! <b>Angelic Pervert </b>allows you to create hot, vivid hentai scenes that the entire table is comfortable and positive about!</i><br/><br/>So, my thought is that Angelic Pervert will be produced as a Flash Application. This is for a bunch of reasons, including:<br/>a.) It's a game about an animation style, and the rules should be an interactive application with H anime "dividers" and "segues".<br/>b.) Hentai is largely popularized by the internet, so a ruleset that's available online makes the most sense.<br/>c.) I like the idea of a ruleset where you can click on things and be brought to a description of those things, instead of being forced to read in a linear order (sure, you could always read a traditional book out of order, but it wouldn't make as much sense.)<br/><br/>I'm going to include a huge section in the Advertising and Promotions section about how it gets this huge, negative backlash in Japan because it's created by a North American author.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106580/#Comment_106580" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T14:49:12+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  2:49PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, but how are you going to market this?

Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/><br/>1. Generating Revenue<br/><br/>a.) The flash application has a few embedded videos of Actual Play in it. It shows quick snaps of scenes in home games and con games. My thought is to somehow do a split screen of movie + ad. So that when you watch Joe McDonald and Graham Walmsley playing Angelic Pervert, along the bottom 1/4 of the screen it shows an ad for Another Lady Innocent/Front Innocent. Depending on the play count of the video, that ad space will cost more or less.<br/><br/>b.) The ruleset is interactive and to a degree non-linear. When you click parts of the page, you are linked to another page of rules. Every 3-4 click-throughs, an ad pops up. You can just click a little button in the corner of the screen to kill the ad so that you're taken to the next rules page. Pricing for these ad spots is higher than the videos (because rules are more core to the game than AP), and are rated based on whether it's core rules or additional descriptions/alternate rules/etc.<br/><br/><br/>So, you have hentai and anime companies advertising through ads that pop up every couple pages of rules you read. The entire thing is available free and has some cool tentacle animations and stuff throughout. Everyone wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106627/#Comment_106627" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T19:35:57+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  7:35PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip - Wicked!<br/><br/><br/>Graham - your other question was about marketing. That I haven't really figured out, and would love some feedback on. Here's the thing: the entire game is funded by in-game advertisements. The advertisements cost more for companies to publish when the game gets more hits and click-throughs and feedback.<br/><br/>So... the way we make more money is to get more people reading and playing Angelic Pervert. That makes advertising space more expensive for publishers but also more valuable.<br/><br/>I'm just not sure how to get people to the flash site. Once they're there, it's solid - the game is awesome, the animated flash app is an interesting and eye-catching presentation of a game, and the occasional ads aren't all that annoying (especially because they are intentionally addressing a community of people who appreciate their wares).<br/><br/>I'm thinking maybe every hentai producer that buys advertising space on Angelic Pervert can get a discounted rate if they post a web banner on their site. That way there's a feedback loop in play - they attract more people, more people increases advertising value, they help reduce their costs by putting up a web banner, which attracts more people. Just a simple "Want to play these scenes out yourself? Try Angelic Pervert - the H Anime Tabletop Roleplaying Game".<br/><br/>I'm thinking that if any RPG publishers want to advertise through Angelic Pervert, they get a super reduced rate (or maybe free) if they also include a full page ad for Angelic Pervert in the back of their book.<br/><br/>The ad for Angelic Pervert will have suggestive images, but no explicit sex scenes, nudity, or violent images. Maybe like a scantily-clad, poorly-proportioned woman and a leering tentacle, with some pretty suggestive ad copy. Therefore, it's something that I could see published in a couple of indie-rpgs, but also rejected for a lot of indie-rpgs.<br/><br/><br/>ANy ideas for marketing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106885/#Comment_106885" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T20:05:00+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:05PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Filip.<br/><br/>I think that including the core resolution mechanics in the flash app would be a bit of a heavy handed approach. But I like the idea that maybe some rules would need to be referenced during play - not constantly, but occassionally.<br/><br/>I was also thinking that the App could include 3 "Soundtrack modes". So that you can bring up the app, load one of three soundtracks ("Looming Tentacle Darkness", "Kind Words From A Dirty Stranger", and "Catgirl Awesome Guitar Solo") and play with the app doing its background thing. That way the app is always RIGHT THERE when you need to pause play and look up rules. Playing a soundtrack also acts as a bit of a Salute In/Out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108356/#Comment_108356" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T01:59:08+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  1:59AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Angelic Pervert allows you to create hot, vivid hentai scenes that the entire table is comfortable and positive about!</blockquote>\n!\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n!!\n<blockquote>Oh, sorry.

So, there's a person who's responsible for selling adspace in the game and promoting the game. How else do they support Angelic Pervert?

I'm not an avid anime or hentai watcher myself. So... I am not 100% sure.<br/><br/>I have two inklings of system so far:<br/><br/><b>Squicks</b>: Squicks are some kind of currency/resource/method which allow players to say "actually, I'm offended by that content" without shutting down another person's fun. I have no idea how that works in practice, but it's a way of removing a piece of the narrative without shutting down the idea. It's about finding mutually acceptible terms on which to layer the story and sex, without bogging down the game and hurting pacing.<br/><br/><b>Dominance</b>: Dominance, whether violent, forceful or simply culturally ingrained, is a huge part of all the hentai I've been witness to. There are simple questionaires that the players use to assess the situation and determine dominance. My thought is that there are a lot of these Dominance "modules", and each player picks them for their characters. These bear similarity to Archetypes/Lifepaths/Classes/Templates, in that they paint broad brush strokes of a character as well as determining what situations the character gains power from.<br/><br/>"Woman" will gain almost all of her points of Dominance for internal-based factors. "Man" will gain almost all of his Dominance from situation-based factors. "Catgirl" will gain almost all of her points of Dominance for exoticness (essentially novelty and innovation). "Tentacled Creatures" will gain a lot of Dominance from fear and mystery. "Sorcerers" will gain all of their Dominance from spells, demons, fear, oppression, and blackmail.<br/><br/>Something along those lines. So that when my catgirl sorcerer tries to chain your innocent woman up in her sex dungeon, I'm determining how much dominance I have for the scene based on how I can manipulate you, what supernatural components I have at my disposal, and how new and exotic I am to you. You're determining your dominance based on power of will, innocence, emotional stability, and other personal factors. In the end, we have these currencies to spend to control narrative and move the action in our desired direction.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a character will only have a token amount of Dominance. They'll be able to put up a  fight, but that's it. The first time you see a catgirl sorceress, and she's kidnapped an innocent and taken her to the sex dungeon, the catgirl sorceress is pretty much going to own that scene. She's got a huge amount of Dominance from both her templates.<br/><br/>That's where Squicks become ultra important. It allows the player of the woman to say "My character isn't going to be raped", without shutting down an obviously vivid action scene for the other player. Then you can divert into a emotional power-play scene, or a "witness my power!" scene, or something that's going to allow both players to be comfortable.<br/><br/>Basically, if you put a pedophile, a feminist, an easily embarrassed college student and a gamer in the same room, I'd want them to be able to play Angelic Pervert together and feel like it did an amazing job of making their fantasies compatible.<br/><br/>Hm... I also think Dominance modules can be player-created. Jake Richmond talked about <b>Player-Created Content</b> in an earlier post... Dominance Modules is where that takes off. If after playing I felt that there really needed to be a "Powerful Businesswoman" module, I could create it and get it inserted into the Flash App. If you felt the Catgirl module missed the entire POINT of catgirl sex, you could re-write the Catgirl module and host up your own version of it.<br/><br/>Dominance Modules allow you to: a.) create part of the mechanics! (just like creating keys, settings, etc), b.) pre-script scenes that get what you want out of the game, c.) tell others where your sexual priorities are.<br/><br/>And, again, Squicks help balance your interests with group comfort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108591/#Comment_108591" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T12:52:57+00:00" title="November 16, 2007 12:52PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            King Morningstar, here is another post in your name:<br/><br/><br/>I think that the ratio of story:sex will really depend on the group. Some hentai is 95% story, with even the sex scenes telling us a lot about really meaningful characters. Some hentai is 5% story, a patchy framework to lay sex upon. Some is just a bunch of bizarre costumes, bizarre anatomical oddities, and bizarre settings, and that's the "story" of the movie.<br/><br/>Most is somewhere in between, with story setting up a lot of sex scenes, and showing us the characters motivations, obsessions and desires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
