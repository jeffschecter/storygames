I've worked through a great deal of it, but the part that I'm really stuck on is skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the game to be about fast character generation, and strong, iconic decision points. To that end, I'm looking at using the idea of roles (ala Cortex+ Leverage RPG) which will more as "skill packages" rather than individual skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I have:<br/>\n<br/>\nWarrior (Fighting, dodging physical attacks, weapons, siegecraft, tactics,etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue (Subterfuge, stealth, thievery, sabotage, streetwise, disguise, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMage (Metaphysics, the planes, sense magic, identify magic, spellcasting, resisting magic, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nScholar (History, myths and legends, languages, medicine, heraldry, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNegotiator (Diplomacy, bluff, sense motive, intimidate, gambling, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDaredevil (Climb, balance, tumble, swim, jump, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSurvivalist (Animal handling, foraging, pathfinding, herbalism, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking to have 10 or so "roles" that encompass typical Big Damn Adventure! skills. I'm thinking that I'd want to regulate everyday, mundane "day job" type skills like crafting, accounting, performing, etc. to a different part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm wondering if anyone has any ideas, or can recommend other games with a pared down skill list, or if you thought of better names for the roles than I have?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks : )                </div>\n<div

class="Message">\n                            So what is the purpose of this rules-light system?<br><br>Is it to use for setting-light super generic fantasy? Is it for add-your-own-flavor-and-tweak-to-match play? Or do you have a specific setting in mind?<br><br>Cause roles do a few very specific things in Leverage.<br/><br/>For one, they group ALL of the potential skills that would be invoked into a very small set of 5 roles. Because of this, you don't have "unskilled checks". You just have areas that you are better at and areas you're worse at.<br/><br/>And secondly, they reflect the setting in a rich and significant way. These are THE roles that are significant for play in this setting. By playing the game, you WILL approach a given task through the use of one of those five roles.<br/><br/>For both of those reasons, I'd suggest that having 10 roles is way too many to get that effect across. 10 roles aren't roles like Leverage uses. They're just classes like good old D&amp;D (where, in my rarely humble opinion, classes are a poorly implemented blah dumb thing that I don't like in any of the editions).<br/><br/>I ran a fantasy campaign where I hacked Savage Worlds and replaced the wild die with a Stat + Job matrix that contained all the Savage Worlds skills, plus a few that reflected the setting.<br/><br/>I was running in a fairy tale based setting, so the Jobs I used were Woodsman, Scoundrel, Soldier, Witch, Servant, and Noble. These weren't chosen for generic reasons, they were specifically designed to reinforce the setting. For example, in many games, Noble would be a title you earned in game. But in a fairy tale, being a princess or a prince or something else similar is super common. And having a high Noble rating as a commoner marks you as one of those characters whose courtesy is remarked upon and puts you in an excellent position to earn a prince or princess's hand as a reward. Plus, you could be a noble and have a low Noble score, meaning that you stand out as being particularly uncouth and ill-suited to your position.<br/><br/>Also, I gave most of the defense abilities to the Servant job. In fairy tales, those in servant positions often have a hard time acting due to their role, but they tend to be quite resiliant in the face of difficulties, so that fit well.<br/><br/>(My wife was playing Cap o' Rushes, which is a Cinderella variant story. So her two highest scores were Servant and Noble, which made perfect sense for a scullery maid who can charm a prince to fall madly in love with her as soon as she puts on a ball gown and starts dancing. Oh, and she rolled ludicrously high twice when charming her prince - he was utterly devoted to her from then on in. The dice matched the source fiction beautifully.)<br/><br/>Anyway, assuming you're looking at implementing some sort of Stat+Job roll, I'd say you can narrow your job list WAY down from 10. Let the Stat part of the dice be the differentiator between, for example, Rogue and Daredevil.<br/><br/>If you're going to be inspired by Leverage, make sure your output accomplishes the things that Leverage does well. 10 roles suggests to me something that won't.<br/><br/>And eschew the generic. Make the roles reflect and reinforce the setting.<br/><br/>And consider separating defenses from the job that produces them as offence. Split "resist magic" out from the Mage job. Better yet, don't use a generic "resist magic". Have something like Willpower to resist charm and influence effects that are both magical and non-magical. Have something like Focus to resist distraction effects that are both magical and non-magical. That way, your Negotiator's skills and your Mage's mind magics can be similar (and I'd suggest making magic that overlaps with another job like that super limited - jack-of-all-powers mages that eliminate the usefulness of other limited-use specialties like rogues and negotiators piss me off. Unlock spells are the bane of my existence).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gizmoduck5000" title="gizmoduck5000"><img alt="gizmoduck5000" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gizmoduck5000">gizmoduck5000</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378284/#Comment_378284" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T15:33:35+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  3:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My intent is to create an action-packed Big Damn Fantasy game very much in the vein of D&amp;D or Exalted, only where the rules are geared for descriptive play rather than tactical.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules resemble Savage Worlds and Cortex+ but are not based around Leverage itself, as Leverage doesn't do what I want MY game to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reasoning behind using the idea of "roles" is that they tell players what their character DOES in the game.

What happens if you combine Mage and Scholar - maybe magic is physically intensive and requires a Wise One + Strength roll, while insight is gained with Wise One + Intelligence and a persuasive scholarly argument is Wise One + Charisma.<br/><br/>I think you get more out of only having, say, 5 or 6 Jobs.<br/><br/>You can also use some sort of Perks as another sort of differentiator. Perks can give +2 for a specific type of non-combat action, or a +1 to a combat action. Plus they can do lots of other things.<br/><br/>That being said, the things that make the Cortex+ games work for more descriptive, less tactical play are not the core stats. They're the everything else. The relationship maps. The flashbacks. The danger pool mechanics. All that sort of stuff is what's key to driving less tactical focused play.<br/><br/>And as I suggestion, I'd say don't put it together as setting agnostic. Make it setting driven. Let the users strip out and switch the setting as they see fit. Users are plenty good at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/todd" title="todd"><img alt="todd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/todd">todd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378617/#Comment_378617" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T06:31:26+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  6:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gizmoduck5000</cite>So I'm kit-bashing a rules-lite fantasy rpg together. I've worked through a great deal of it, but the part that I'm really stuck on is skills.<br/><br/>I want the game to be about fast character generation, and strong, iconic decision points. To that end, I'm looking at using the idea of roles (ala Cortex+ Leverage RPG) which will more as "skill packages" rather than individual skills.<br/><br/>[snip]<br/><br/>I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas, or can recommend other games with a pared down skill list, or if you thought of better names for the roles than I have?</blockquote>\nTake a look at Barbarians of Lemuria. Rules light, simple character creation and role-based skill groups called careers. Its base system is 2d6+modifiers vs target number 9, but it's also SUPER EASY to convert that to step dice (-1=d4, 0=d6 ... 3=d12). I think the standard BoL stat ranges go from -1 to 5, so it's not a direct conversion, but its certainly workable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
