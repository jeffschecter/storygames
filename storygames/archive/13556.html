And then maybe you refine your GMing, or your character, or try to make a game?  And all the while, you've got this vision of what play should be like?  Maybe it's something you've done before, but not reliably.  Maybe it's something you've almost done, but never quite.  Maybe it's cobbled together from your favorite bits of other play.  Whatever its origins, it's palpable.  Some combo of social vibe, game choices, system interaction, style, genre... you know it'll be <i>awesome</i>.<br/><br/>So, now, how do you go about taking that vision and making it happen?<br/><br/>I can't answer that question.  Ry St. and I were discussing it, and he suggested I start with an example of a highlight from one of my games.  So, here's a typical payoff moment from Delve:<br/><br/><i>With the clock ticking down, the characters face a final danger and a puzzle.  The players, fully immersed, deploy their characters' resources to survive the danger long enough to use their own wits to innovate a particularly elegant solution to the puzzle.<br/><br/>Actual play example:<br/>The characters decide to alter the potion and dip the rune-stones in it to create a giant "protection from curses" rune in the wall of the haunted castle.  As Jan dangles from a melting portcullis to insert rune-stones, Alaric and Roderick distract the undead king who has the power to stop the rune.  Alaric feints a sword stroke so the king will waste his command powers on stopping it, while hiding a holy water flask under his shield arm.  The king is spritzed and dissolves; Roderick braces the portcullis as the castle threatens to crumble; Jan adds the final brick.  <br/><br/>Everyone holds their breath and looks to the GM.  <br/><br/>The GM describes the curse effects vanishing.  The dark mists part, the cursed doors fall, and the reanimated dead crumble to dust.<br/><br/>High fives all around.</i><br/><br/>That wasn't the <i>majority</i> of my vision of "what play should be like", but it was a <i>key part</i> of that vision.  So, Ry, what next?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306282/#Comment_306282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T17:48:16+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  5:48PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So this moment of play is like...<br/><br/>the player and their character have a simultaneous 'eureka'! moment<br/><br/>this is<br/>- immersive (high correspondance between the character and the player - THIS IS HAPPENING)<br/>- empowering (now we can survive this deathtrap / kill the monster / save the village - i.e. THIS MATTERS)<br/>- authentic (the player figured it out, not hand-fed by the GM - I DID THIS)<br/><br/>So, my next question would be what other moments had to happen before this moment could arrive?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306366/#Comment_306366" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T09:00:56+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  9:00AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick note before I respond: <br/>The cut-off for "authentic" is very low.

This is usually an advertised  problem with at least some hint of reward for fixing it.  <br/><br/>This moment often comes while leisurely pondering options for what to do next.  These can range from fairly low engagement/immersion if starting from indifference to super high engagement/immersion if furthering a plan the players have previously concocted.<br/><br/><i>The haunted castle was listed on the PCs' very first "help wanted" sign as "too tough for you".</i><br/><br/><b>Promise.</b>  Early in the process of checking out the opportunity, some NPC will clarify what stands to be gained here.<br/><br/>When this merely confirms the players' initial guess, no biggie.  When it's something unexpected and cool, the excitement can skyrocket.<br/><br/><i>Imperial officers revealed the haunted castle to be at a point of great strategic importance for them.  Their appreciation and payment for this job would be orders of magnitude beyond any village-saving.</i><br/><br/><b>Lead.</b>  A second potential reward, often less well-defined.  Usually the potential to find something out that isn't directly related to a scenario's core.  This can hook more specific player goals than the Promise's more general offers of fame, status and wealth.<br/><br/>Players often pick a Hook based on this, eager to follow up on some project they've already invested in.<br/><br/><i>They decided to go after the haunted castle</i> now <i>because one of their enemies had just fled to it.</i><br/><br/><b>Secret.</b>  New knowledge about the supernatural.  A piece of the puzzle.<br/><br/>These are always highly engaging when first encountered.  Players get psyched about their potential.  Then: (A) When they quickly figure out how to derive some actual use from adding this piece to their other puzzle pieces, it's a celebration.  (B) When they quickly figure out how this <i>probably</i> gets them closer to doing <i>something</i> cool, there's just as much enthusiasm, with much speculating.  (C) When the new puzzle piece is inscrutable and the players just stash it for later, play continues at its current level of engagement.  (D) When the inscrutable piece gets poked at for too long, engagement wanes.<br/><br/>When (A) happens and the new ability actually helps with the current problem, that's The Ultimate.  (Why don't I try this every scenario?  Too fast a rate of gaining useful magic powers utterly ruins the game's tone.)<br/><br/><i>In the haunted castle, the players discovered a way to make rune-patterns activate: construct them out of bricks enchanted by a special potion!</i><br/><br/><b>Clues</b> and <b>Tasks</b>.  This is the process of pursuit, discovery, complication, theory, experiment, and victory (usually).  It's also the narrative in which the fiction comes alive, with vivid places, colorful actions, moral dilemmas, horrific monsters, occult plots, tense negotiations, and combat.  <br/><br/>Engagement is highest when the players know how to make progress toward some goal(s) and are planning or pursuing that.  <br/><br/>Engagement is also high when players jump at a situation that facilitates striking portrayals of characters -- moral stances, great speeches, showing off, pet causes, and well-timed visual descriptions.<br/><br/><i>Jan looks out for the poor and hates abusive nobles.  Roderick promotes free knowledge of magic and hates fearful superstition.  Alaric likes scaring people first and reassuring them second.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306940/#Comment_306940" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T11:13:06+00:00" title="January  5, 2011 11:13AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had an 'aha' moment; I realized we were doubling jargon, because I'm making up mine as I go but you have similar terms.<br/><br/>I shouldn't have asked about Tasks, because after a day of reflection I realized that what I'm trying to get at is a diagram, independent of game-specific language.  <br/><br/>I am creating that diagram in google docs, I will post it as a .pdf when I'm done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306946/#Comment_306946" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T11:46:17+00:00" title="January  5, 2011 11:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2011 11:52AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

That is most excellent!  It is definitely at least pretty close to the way I see things.  I will think hard about which boxes really deserve the thick lines...<br/><br/>Relative to the thoroughness of your description of GM hooks/promises/leads and player responses, the link between "PCs choose some particular small-scale problem to resolve" and "PCs undertake to resolve a larger-scale problem in a situation that involves risk" seems a little incomplete.  <br/><br/>Thinking about an example from last night, the PCs were already determined to quell the menace of the Tentacled Thing Beneath the Ziggurat.  They first dealt with the small problem of preserving their cultist allies' secrecy, and in the process made friends with a scout who can help chart the reach of the tentacles.  So the little problem effected <i>how</i> they pursued the big problem, but not <i>whether</i> they pursued it.  This is a fairly common configuration, but there are others.  Looking at it more broadly, I think there are basically two requirements for the PCs undertaking a big problem:<br/>1) it gets on their to-do list<br/>2) of all the things on their to-do list, it achieves the position of either Most Fun or Most Urgent (or, rarely, Most Doable, where everything else on the to-do list is too risky at the moment)<br/><br/>Anyway, that was a semi-tangent.

I'm fine if my specific labeled bits of prep never come into the discussion.  If and when they do, though, hopefully the labels will provide useful discussion shorthand.<br/><br/>I'm mulling whether the conditions for "eureka!" are purely "state of the fiction" (there is knowledge and cohering and danger), or whether they also rely on "our experience getting there".  I'm not just talking about being primed to want the thing you get, I'm talking about the dramatic arc of discovery, speculation, fear, etc.  I wonder if perhaps the thick-outlined boxes are simultaneously part of what makes "eureka!" moments work <i>and</i> what makes play as a whole work.  It's difficult to disentangle.<br/><br/>The main thing I see totally missing from the current chart is about portraiture.  The personal styles of how the characters go about their activities are huge.  Expressions of these are more strongly correlated with engagement than any specific activities.  I'm always looking to give the PCs opportunities to brag about their exploits, show off their scars and trophies, and make moral statements central to their personalities.  The moment where the manor lord gives you a feast <i>because you're you</i> is its own sort of "eureka!"<br/><br/>Regarding the chart, all of those boxes fall within "where the game wants to be", including character failure.  Running from a scary thing is huge!  Delve would be broken and wrong if that never happened.  So I think we need a more precise language for what you're honing in on, here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307108/#Comment_307108" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T11:02:47+00:00" title="January  6, 2011 11:02AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also:<br/><br/>In the Choice Cycle, following "furthering a plan the players have previously concocted", there could be a few options for a next box, describing how they pick how to proceed.

I also opened up a new section in the upper right that I want to use for the Prep cycle.  The Prep cycle basically has the work that underpins the red diamonds (i.e. there would be an arrow from various parts of the prep cycle to various parts of the play cycle).  <br/><br/><a href="http://ryswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DelveCycles2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Delve Cycles 2</a><br/><br/>So in theory we've now inferred required prep as from the vision for play.

It's just "whoever the PCs ask first", which tends to be their choice of a village elder, a manor steward, or the first farmer they bump into, depending on their mood.<br/><br/>As for the other red diamonds: I always prep 3 and 4.  But for 5 and 6, I usually just remind myself what the PCs have been up to and caring about recently, and then I'll inevitably be inspired by something in play.

Certainly as much as the other corrections you pointed out.  But I think we keep going in this vein as if the diagram were accurate.  <br/><br/>For that purpose, let's call this game DigDownwards to distinguish it from Delve (because for Delve I'd have more nuanced diagrams and I'd make corrections).  <br/><br/>So for DigDownwards, this is a perfect representation.  What I'm saying is THIS diagram, prep cycle included, is a clear articulation of a vision of how DigDownwards should play.  <br/><br/>There's no value statement here except for the "we hope the game ends up hitting thick boxes a lot."  <br/><br/>What you want is for most of the arrows, and to a lesser extent the boxes, become things you want your system* to do <b>well</b>, including an arrow from Prep to Play for everything marked with a diamond.  With consideration given to the # of reps you're expecting to run.  <br/><br/>To me, that's a vision for play, clearly articulated, that basically constitutes a design schematic, for which you can seek fellow-designer-help improving every piece.  Where every piece is every arrow.  And where improving is up to you (like, doing failure well is doing it quickly and getting over it, doing success well may take longer and provide the expected level of in-game reward).  <br/><br/>That was more or less the point I was trying to make.<br/><br/>* A game's rules don't define, but instead inspire and provoke, its system. - Vx Baker                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308019/#Comment_308019" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T09:39:48+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  9:39AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.  So, as a first step before asking for help on system, you're suggesting that aspiring designers ought to make such charts?  As a visual learner, I do find that appealing.<br/><br/>That said, the vision represented in the DigDown chart could be seen as overly specific, nailing down too many steps and details, when really, an early-stage vision doesn't include them.<br/><br/>For example, my inspiration to make Delve stems from 3 things:<br/>1) the coolness of the highlights - thick-lined boxes<br/>2) the coolness of the mood and depth of imagination of the whole process - a giant array of boxes with no inherent number or definitions<br/>3) other games I've played - will probably suggest default content for certain boxes when they come up<br/><br/>Nailing down not just your vision but also some prerequisites to realizing it sounds like making design decisions to me.  And if we're asking each other for help on the internet, maybe we aren't looking to make those decisions just yet.<br/><br/>Do you think visions could still be adequately communicated in this fashion with big question marks preceding things like "players get interested in a risky goal"?

But the prerequisites for that moment, though, aren't up to you.  I'm saying that those prerequisites should really be inferred from that payoff.  The process of understanding these basic elements are the process of you clarifying your vision for play. <br/><br/>Like, a game where I get this incredible, blood-rushing satisfaction from my character stabbing his stepfather to death.  I think to myself... well, how do I make that satisfying?  I need at least some build up of fictional transgressions by the stepfather...

We're not talking about choices made to fill the requisite niches, we're talking about the niches themselves.
