Neither does "stunt" or "feat." I would like the special abilities granted by the class to apply as much to the <i>player</i> as to the character.<br/><br/>Yeah, the pilgrims can all fly. Yeah, there might be some other wuxia abilities on display. I don't want to just make them straight superheroes, though. And yet, I like the idea of weirdness and unusual events occurring in the pilgrims' presence, sometimes caused by the pilgrims themselves, but not always.<br/><br/>Even if they had special powers, because Do is leaning towards being GM-free, I couldn't rely on a GM to introduce situations where characters could show off those abilities. So, I thought it'd be cool if I gave the players some toys that facilitated affecting the game in a manner similar to "powers," but flavored in a different way. In lieu of powers, I'm mulling over giving each class a short list of "events" that are likely to occur when they're around.<br/><br/>As an example of the difference:\n<blockquote>If you were to take the classic D&amp;D fighter, his powers would include stuff like doing extra damage, attacking multiple targets, and surviving extensive injuries.<br/><br/>If you were to look at the Fighter's "events," they'd probably include stuff like "Ambushed!" "A New Challenger Arrives," and "All Problems Can Be Solved With Punching."</blockquote>\nBasically, Events could <i>include</i> the stuff that'd normally be considered powers, but they'd also go beyond the scope of the character's abilities, extending to the territory of general scene-framing. It's an even more explicit way of saying to the group, "In playing this character, I am declaring that I want this sort of stuff to happen in the story."<br/><br/>What I also like about this is that you could take any ol' archetype, from pauper to prince, from Batman to Superman, from cute pet to ancient nature spirit, and they'd be equally "powerful" in terms of how they could affect the flow of the narrative, yet they'd still be unique and flavorful.<br/><br/>I might about go through the  <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Characters" rel="nofollow">list of archetypal characters</a> on tvtropes.org and see if this holds up by attributing behaviors and events to some of the characters listed there.<br/><br/>Again, I get the sneaking suspicion that I've seen this somewhere before. Are there other games that take a similar perspective on "powers"? Also, is "Event" the right word for this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77554/#Comment_77554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T16:35:20+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  4:35PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, how would "Ambushed!" differ from the players' regular ability to influence what happens in the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77571/#Comment_77571" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T17:08:12+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  5:08PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, suppose a fighter is good at taking on mooks. In a GMed game, I'd advise that the GM look at that ability and use that as a cue to insert a couple scenes where the fighter can take on a big mob of ninjas, zombies or nameless henchmen. "Ambushed!" would be a way for the fighter-player to introduce such a scene. At which point he'd... resolve it... hrm...<br/><br/>Gah... now I'm seeing the trouble. "I'm introducing my own opportunities to be awesome" doesn't sound very fun, does it?<br/><br/>Hey, what if you worked in a card-drafting mechanic?

I wonder if there's a way it could be done using a points system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77920/#Comment_77920" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T14:59:55+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  2:59PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to use cards as a convenient play aid, but not one that is absolutely necessary for play. So say you could use "Ambushed!" three times in a session, you could represent that by filling little bubbles on a character sheet or playing cards from a deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
