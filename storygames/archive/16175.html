Once I was old enough I started going to the library on my own, finding more encyclopaedias, a trove of scifi paperbacks from the 70's and issues of scientific magazines. That was exactly the time when I lost any interest in football :-)<br/><br/>I used to spend lots of time drawing pictures of mythical heroes and battles and I created maps of imaginary places with exotic names, spanning page after page of connected A4 sheets of paper.<br/><br/>Then there were videogames. We used to get our bikes and ride to the arcades watching the older boys playing for hours, waiting in line and scrounging the coins to play a few games ourselves. We couldn't really afford a console at the time and I decided I could make my own games, copying the mechanics of console games.<br/><br/>The most complex board game I had seen at the time was monopoly and, as far as I knew, board games were boring things where you just followed a fixed path by rolling dice.<br/><br/>Inspired by the arcade games I started drawing 2d or 3d maps with discreet locations that the characters could move through, following many different paths. The characters were the heroes from videogames and epic stories, moving over the detailed world maps that I had drawn. I used to draw them very small, cut them out and use them as characters in the story. I used a single d6 to add randomness and the stories were pretty simple. Heroes and villains had different goals: get that artefact, kill that monster, kidnap the princess.. the d6 was used for movement, and for confrontation and to jump over traps. There were no hit points, but you had 'lives' you could use and collect, like in a videogame.<br/><br/>While the system was entirely mechanical, in my mind every die roll created some fiction and the characters started developing motivations and an individual character. Two villains could become allies or mortal enemies, sometimes the princess didn't want to be saved and occasionally the hero took over the villain's castle and became the new tyrant. Whenever I saw a movie, a comic or a cartoon that I liked, I sat down and just made a game out of it! It was my way to appropriate pop culture and make it mine.<br/><br/>Then fighting fantasy games started going mainstream and in a short time I found out about T&amp;T, D&amp;D and the whole subculture.. and I started running away from home and riding the train for 3 hours to get to the closest mythical RPG shop.<br/><br/>What I find fascinating is that some other pieces of culture started accreting as if they wanted me to produce something like an RPG and I am sure this has happened to other people too. I am curious to know your garden of eden** stories.. before you were exposed to the hobby and to its subculture.<br/><br/>This is my story.<br/>--i.<br/><br/>**I realize that it was not a pure isolated environment.. videogames in the early 80's were probably already incorporating some RPG and board game concepts for example, but I was not consciously aware of anything like open-paths boardgames, multiple choice stories or RPGs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368746/#Comment_368746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T02:21:34+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  2:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, what were your Garden of Eden RPGs like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368756/#Comment_368756" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T04:35:58+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  4:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me and a friend invented RPGs by emulating Lucas Arts style adventure games. They were usually very simple escape the room type things but one day when I was GMing and he was some sort of criminal trying to set up a trap for the private eye that was hounding him (adventure game style ofc. using soap and fly paper and stuff) he just said fuck it and left the hotel his character was staying at, hijacked a yatch in the harbour and suddenly the whole world opened up.<br/><br/>Later we were influensed by games such as Final Fantasy and Septerra Core to the point of having turn based battles despite not having any rules or anything. Many things obviously took the D&amp;D -&gt; some video game -&gt; our game route but I remember introducing a magical dagger that could detect gold (but that was problably me reading LOTR and thinking detecting orcs was a silly ability). Some older guy overheard us roleplaying and was like "are you roleplaying?" and we were like "Wtf is that?" and then we were brought into the fold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368769/#Comment_368769" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T06:55:53+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  6:55AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was about eight or nine, I heard about <i>D&amp;D</i> from a kid on the bus, though I have no idea how the topic of conversation got around to that.  He informed me that a big part of the game was "fighting monsters," which I interpreted to mean monsters that fight <i>each other</i> (I'm on the bleeding edge of the autism spectrum).  Not having access to any of the actual game books, I created a game myself which involved drawing a monster and giving it various weapons for duels with other kids' monsters.  To facilitate combat, I wrote up a few tables that used a single roll of a six-sided die to randomize hit locations, though I can't recall how I handled damage, if at all.  A monster was taken out of combat when its secret weakness was struck, so a torso hit would disable a monster with a soft underbelly.<br/><br/>Eventually I was able to get ahold of the actual <i>D&amp;D</i> rules and my understanding of roleplaying changed dramatically, as you would expect.  What I was doing before wasn't roleplaying in any conventional sense, beyond inhabiting the "role" of a fighting monster, but it was fun for a time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368772/#Comment_368772" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T08:04:02+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  8:04AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great topic, man!<br/><br/>I made up rules to create normal people using Marvel Super Heroes, just a bunch of charts really.

We watched the D&amp;D TV show, and asked each other and looked in libraries for the game to no avail. We thought it was just a myth. Then, like 10 years later, I found the strangest article on a newspaper, describing RPGs in a fashion that only made them more mysterious. Suddenly there was not only an actual D&amp;D game, but one about Robotech (a tv show I was already a huge fan by then) and many others. That was probably what awakened the hacker in me for the first time.<br/><br/>There wasn't any way to find the books, not even in english (which I wasn't even remotely familiar with by then) so I went on and tried to figure out the mechanics by the things mentioned in the article and every boardgame I knew by then. It ended resembling a sort of huge hexagonal map with lots of events listed in tables. Wherever you could go there could be something happening, but I failed completely to provide players with a motivation to go there. Or even play it fully. We tried it a couple of times and then I abandoned it completely and threw it out.<br/><br/>I took me another ten years to finally find somebody who had actually played a real RPG, who told me of this brave new world where fantasy flew wild an free from one horizon to the other. Half a year later I was hacking my first game out of a mix of Palladium's Robotech and some d20, to run a rewritten version of an old robotech argetinian module, one of the campaigns I've enjoyed the most in all my years as a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368823/#Comment_368823" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T14:17:32+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  2:17PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2012 2:17PM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh shit!

Our characters and their interactions were very informed by Squaresoft games of the day.<br/><br/>We were just on that too-old-for-this edge where spontaneous imagination like that was still magical and rewarding, but just a little bit sophisticated, too.

Before then I had seen D&amp;D ads in comics, so I had an idea that RPGs existed, but didn't have any idea what play should look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after selectively reading through the Dark Sun books, my younger brother and a few friends and I started playing "Dragonfield", a tolkien-esque fantasy LARP (except with Muls and Thri-Kreen, too, because Dark Sun!) that entailed us running around my wooded back yard in character. All of my friends had static characters which became exponentially more powerful over time, eventually becoming gods or kings of the setting, at which point my friends would start playing their old character's son or brother or something. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never really had a static character, and conceived of myself in kind of a GM role (though I had only a tenous grasp on what that meant) - I played all the NPCs, described the world, and gave out quests and treasure. Also, I drew maps and illustrated particularly awesome moments from our games, to show off at school the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were no mechanics to speak of - everything was done basically by fiat, though once in a while we'd simulate a battle using sticks for swords (because: little boys). I just came up with the challenge of the day (usually based on whatever I was reading at the time - we played through the plots of a few of the Narnia books, and some of the Terry Brooks Shannara stuff, too), everyone would say what they wanted to do, and I'd dictate outcomes. Sometimes players would argue, in which case we'd compromise, but mostly they just said okay and we moved on to the next thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, I think the fun first started to die when I tried to introduce some more sophisticated plots and drama - specifically romance. Shockingly, pre-pubescent boys weren't overly keen on the idea of acting out a mock romance with another boy-talking-in-a-girl-voice. Shortly after that (when I was 11) I started to drift away from that group of friends - they realized that the stuff we were doing was nerd stuff, which didn't deter me in the least but which was anathema to their budding adolescent egos. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I think about it, though, I learned a lot of what I think of as my GMing skills from playing Dragonfield in a total rules vacuum.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat topic - thanks for causing me to think about this stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368844/#Comment_368844" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T17:01:00+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  5:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Miles, so you guys were acting out campaigns? I remember playing pretend and building stories but we had NO concept at all that a story could last beyond the few hours when we were playing. Amazing really that we were unwittingly putting up those limitations .<br/><br/>Hans, so did you get the girls in the end? ;-) <br/><br/>I also have to thank the hobby for many of the skills I acquired as a kid. I still clearly remember learning english while painstakingly translating the spells of AD&amp;D2E. This later allowed me to go to study abroad for many years.  All the attempts at balancing systems and designing rules proved invaluable for my later studies and work. And all the epic shit was really a motivating factor in making me face apparently insurmountable odds and just keep going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
