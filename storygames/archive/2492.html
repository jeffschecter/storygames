                    My Saturday gaming group is coming along nicely. We've just had a month of Star Wars using a homebrew based on PTA (sorta): d6 Dice pool. Set stakes, roll your attribute+skill+passion  and compare to the GM's arbitrary 'difficulty' pool. Results of 1-3 are successes, and the person with the highest dice on the table chooses who narrates. Everyone has gift dice they can offer around, too.<br/><br/>Our next game sounds like it's going to be set in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menzoberranzan" rel="nofollow">Menzoberranzan</a> and my group would like to keep the same system, more or less. We'll be working on a theme document on Saturday, but I expect we'd like to focus on depravity, weird magical experiments, baroque artforms, family politics, slavery and lots of corsetry.<br/><br/>I thought I'd strip down the system, making skills, motivations, equipment and allies numerically equivalent. Characters would have three or four attributes in common. Characters could also have family dice - 'The Honor of House Xtpyl, 2d6' etc.<br/><br/>We're also throwing out the GM. Pretty cool for a group that was strictly traditional till 6 months ago. So, like Polaris, the person sitting opposite is responsible for your conflict.<br/><br/>This is all fine. HOWEVER, I wonder if we should have some sort of riskable resource to play with... to make the game more gamey. But what would evil drow have to risk? It's not reputation if you spend your time wallowing in the blood of innocents. They don't really have consciences. <br/><br/>Joe.                </div>

                            I don't know, I think more like critical fumbles/successes are rewarded/punished, rather than everyday acts. If you're a very successful swordman, then losing to someone who isn't as good as you will cause you to lose Reputation, which you can somehow regain by immediately killing the one who bested you, but it's more on a case-by-case basis.                        </div>

I'm not Guy but I'm going to take a shot at this.  I don't really see how the Drow being transgressive would make scenes where reputation was on the line dull.  At least it shouldn't be any more dull than playing the same kinds of scene in another setting.  The only thing you are doing by playing Drow is turning the standard by which you judge reputation on its head.  Just make a list of things that the Drow value as a culture: Strength, Cunning, Skill, Ruthlessness, and Beauty.  Set up scenes that put these things at risk for the characters.  If the players are buying into the setting then this should hold some interest for them and it won't be dull.                        </div>

                            Hey Joe,<br/><br/>This is one of those ideas I've kicked around myself. One of my thoughts is that loyalty to House could for a lot more than you might expect. That way, you can have some sort of "common good" for PCs to belong to and cooperate with, without spending the whole game trying to backstab one another. For a different sort of game, the PCs could be united in their membership in a non-Lolth cult -- maybe invested in bringing down the drow matriarchy!<br/><br/>"Conscience" for drow can boil down to things like "Don't be a weakling," "Don't suffer an insult," "Enslave your lessers," that sort of thing. Just because the morality's inverted doesn't mean they don't subscribe to some culturally-enforced value system. I mean, if other drow notice you're not enthusiastically pulling for drow values of violent self-supremacy, that's clearly a sign you've gone soft and need to be culled from society.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I think you're looking at the same sort of inhumanly ruthless courtly intrigues you might get in a <i>Vampire</i> game. So there's something you can mine for actual play wisdom.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh yeah! I forgot about "united against a common greater enemy" like mind flayers or whatever.                        </div>

                            Cheers, Larry. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> Great stuff, and Vampire's a good example of lots of the tropes (and perhaps, pitfalls to avoid).<br/><br/>As the group is only slightly familiar with D&amp;D (or drow for that matter), I'm going to suggest we write up a theme document to begin with rather than expect each of us to be on the same page. So I was going to push for the matriarchal spider cults being scary and new. And thus something to fight or fear or exploit (or join).<br/><br/>I've also been chatting to my gf who's a huge fan of Regency romance novels, which have terrific genre conventions. So I'm also going to suggest that loyalty to one's ancestors (and perhaps a mainstream ancestor-worship) and family name is absolutely vital. Don't dishonor the name.<br/><br/>I'll let y'all know how it goes. Our first discussion is tomorrow. <br/><br/>Joe.                        </div>
