It's charming and occasionally hilarious and easy to do and nerve-wracking in equal parts.<br/><br/>However, once in a while you can get a set of scores which is unusually high or unusually low and present a bit of a challenge in one way or another. I recently came across a couple of very clever ways to generate D&amp;D ability scores, and I'll share them with you.<br/><br/>These keep the random and simple approach, but also introduce an element of "balance". Interesting!<br/>\n<blockquote><b>Method 1</b><br/><br/>Pick any two abilities, and then roll 3d6. The first ability receives the rating you just rolled. The second receives a score equal to "21 - [the first score]".<br/><br/>e.g.<br/><br/>"I'm rolling for Strength and Intelligence!" You roll an 8.<br/><br/>This means your Strength score is an 8, and your Intelligence is 13 (21 minus 8).<br/><br/>Repeat two more times for the remaining four abilities.<br/><br/><br/><b>Method 2</b><br/><br/>Get a regular deck of cards. Take out all the cards above a 6, and all the Spades. Your deck (the remaining cards) will consist of Ace through 6 in three suits - eighteen cards.<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards. Now deal three cards for each ability score, and add up the values, counting Aces as "1". For example, an Ace, a 5, and a 4 would give you a score of 10. Two Aces and a 6 would give you an 8. And so on.<br/><br/>(A cool thing about this one is that you can very gradually change the average results by replacing one or more cards with a better/worse card from the missing suit, tuning the process appropriately for whatever sort of D&amp;D you're trying to play. Maybe you take out the 6's from this little deck and replace them with the 2, 3, and 4 of Spades, to make a deck which generates slightly lower ability scores for "normal" people.)</blockquote>\n<br/>Under both methods, you get random scores in the 3-18 range, but every character's ability scores will add up to the same total - no one will come out with a super-competent set of stats, or vice-versa.<br/><br/>What do you think of these? Conceptually? Mechanically? (I can see an issue with the first one already; less so with the second one...)<br/><br/>What's the purpose of random ability scores in D&amp;D, anyway, for you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433035/#Comment_433035" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-26T17:47:43+00:00" title="May 26, 2014  5:47PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2014 5:48PM by biffboff.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, it depends on what version of D&amp;D you're playing - not just the edition but the play-style/expectations (heroes, super heroes, grunts and grogs, desperate peasants put through a grinder funnel).<br/><br/>One version I haven't seen is something like this: the lower your ability scores, the better your saving throws. A sort of built in "luck" factor. Now it doesn't matter what method you use (3D6 down the line, point buy, choose whatever numbers you want) - there is an automatic corresponding balance (yeah, yeah, "balance" is anathema! someone is shouting at their computer screen. Don't get your neck-beard in a knot ; )<br/><br/>I won't speculate on what might be a good conversion on the two editions I'm familiar with.

I'm interested in comparing that statistic.</blockquote>\nThe only way for this to occur is if all three '6' cards happen to end up in the same attribute. In other words, we're placing 18 balls in 6 boxes, and hoping that all three black balls end up in the same box. The balls are all going into the boxes randomly and at the same time (we shuffled the deck in advance, in other words). We might as well ignore the white balls (the cards that are not '6') and just throw in the black balls, as their distribution is the only thing that matters to us here: if all three do not hit the same box, we don't have an '18'.<br/><br/>This reframing of your question should make it obvious that the probability is (1/6)*(1/6)*(1/6), or roughly half a percent. This is the same probability that rolling an 18 with a single roll of 3d6 has, which of course makes sense, as we're basically distributing the range of a single 3d6 roll between the entire array of six attributes.<br/><br/>As we know, the probability of getting at least one 18 with the ordinary method is about 2,7%, so clearly higher. Again this makes sense: in the cards method you only have three sixes to go around, and if any of them ends up in the wrong place, the other two are "wasted" for this purpose. In the dicing method each roll is independent, and therefore you can't "waste" them in the wrong places. Thus, despite having the same average outcome, the cards method discourages extreme results that depend on getting specific combinations of the dice; the more specific the requirements (such as for '18' and '3'), the stronger this effect is. Thus the random distribution of the cards method has a more pronounced bell curve than the standard method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433114/#Comment_433114" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T08:17:07+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  8:17AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I think there's at least one problem with your analysis.  I'm trying to figure out if ignoring the 15 "white balls" creates a more systemic problem that's harder to account for, but even if not, your framing of the problem isn't quite right.  Your (1/6)*(1/6)*(1/6) is the chance of any <i>particular</i> stat being an 18, I think.  When you toss the first black ball, you know it's going somewhere.  So you that's a 1, not a 1/6.  Then there's a 1/6 that the next one joins it and a 1/6 that the third one joins them both.  So that sounds like 2.8% of an 18 somewhere.

A "deck" is the arrangement of all 18 cards after shuffling.

With the ratio of cards, a character will ALWAYS have one bonus for each penalty (if I did the math right)<br/><br/>We can generate countless combinations of unique numbers, but keep the bonuses very 'fair'.

So it's actually 1/36 to get all three sixes in the same stat.<br/><br/>Tod: your solution is wrong because you're not counting all acceptable hands. For example, it is not the case that there are only six possible deck permutations that give you 18 Strength; your list accounts for all permutations of the three '6' cards involved, but it also assumes that every other card will, for some reason, come down in a specific way.<br/><br/>To get the correct odds that way, you need to multiply the 36 permutations with the size of the probability space of the other cards. If the '6' cards are in Strength, then the other 15 cards can be in any order whatsoever, and thus there are 6*15! permutations for combinations where you have 18 in Strength, rather than just 6. As the case is the same for the other attributes, we find that there are 36*15! permutations that have a 18 in an ability. Because 36*15!/18! = 36/(18*17*16) = 36/4896 = 6/816 = 1/136, we find a probability of roughly 0,7%.<br/><br/>Interestingly I got a different result than the first time. Next, let's figure out what's wrong with my balls and boxes solution - I feel more convinced by Tod's approach here <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433126/#Comment_433126" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T08:54:57+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  8:54AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason for why my balls and boxes solution gives 1/36 while Tod's permutation space solution gives 1/136 is of course that I'm assuming that the three black balls are distributed first. This wouldn't matter otherwise, except I'm discounting all the permutations where some of the white balls go in first and ruin one or more of the slots for the black balls. For example, if we first assign a '2' in Strength, then we actually only have five attribute slots that <i>can</i> get an '18', because the white ball already ruined that Strength slot.<br/><br/>Tod's right about the permutation space being the right solution for this, so let's forget the combinatorics for now. Of course we'll need to drag them (or AnyDice!) out when the inevitable follow-up questions start <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433129/#Comment_433129" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T09:10:59+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  9:10AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2014 9:14AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right Eero.

He said to look at it this way: Consider a stat to be a "hand" and each of the six stats is a player sitting around a table.  Each player will be dealt three cards.  For a single player, (18/3) * (17/2) * (16/1) = 816 so the chance of getting a 6/6/6 is 1 in 816.<br/><br/>But you're not the only player (aka stat).  There are 5 others.  So the chance of SOMEONE (some stat) being dealt a 6/6/6 would be 6 times (1 in 816) or 1 in 136.<br/><br/>For comparison, your chance of rolling a natural 6/6/6 on 3d6 is 1 in 216, so the chance of SOME stat being 18 is 6 times that, or 1 in 36.  In other words, the dice are 3.7 times as likely to generate a natural 18 as the cards are.  In addition, the dice could conceivably generate more than one 18, while the cards could not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433179/#Comment_433179" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T11:22:32+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 11:22AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aslf: that's what I get for the cards too.

In it, you deal out all the cards (A to 6, four suits) into six stacks of four, drop one from each stack, and assign as desired. It's basically the 4d6-drop-lowest method to Paul's 3d6 method.<br/><br/>Both methods are also interesting because they're hard to cheat. Even if you totally arrange your cards instead of shuffling them first, you're still going to come out in the same ballpark as anyone else in the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
