I didn't buy it mainly because I was confused by the conflict rules after having played it at Games on Demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we played, it seemed like we were introducing our own conflicts till a player died and took over the zombies. Example:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Bob's turn.<br/>\n- Bob: "Sam and Lou are in the scene."<br/>\n- Bob: "We are in the mall trying to move up the stairs to evade the zombies."<br/>\n- No one is playing the zombies yet, so there is no conflict to get away.<br/>\n- Bob: "We are slowed down by having to drag Lou in his wheel chair with us so the Zombies get closer."<br/>\n- No conflict yet since no other player's in the scene oppose (does that mean no conflicts if only one player is in the scene?)<br/>\n- Bob: "I drop Lou and leave him to his fate so the rest of us can get away."<br/>\n- Lou: "No way, I hold on to you..."<br/>\n- Conflict!<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect we were playing incorrectly. Help!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the positive side, I really liked:<br/>\n- the board<br/>\n- character creation<br/>\n- the box set and pieces<br/>\n- the price<br/>\n- the dice mechanic<br/>\n- aiding with your character in the same scene<br/>\n- supporting as a player, regardless if you are the same scene (Ryan Macklin describes this as a way to vote people off the island!)<br/>\n- how characters die and move on the board<br/>\n<br/>\nSide note, my character was forced to escape faster than I wanted him to. So towards the end I tried to lose conflicts so I can stay in the game a few more scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm eager to learn more!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163253/#Comment_163253" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T10:11:32+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 10:11AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Until someone dies, the conflicts are among the PC's.

The thing is:  Everyone on one side moves up, and everyone on one side moves down, right?  So there is a <i>group advantage</i> to unbalanced sides:  If you have four people, you want three of them to be moving up while only one is moving down.  That's a net win for the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI refer to this as the "Asshole savior" effect.  The one person in the group who is saying stuff that is <i>obviously wrong-headed</i> is doing the most good for the team.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than dropping Lou and leaving him to his fate, for instance, you could have your character be really offensive ... "Why we bothering to wheel this gimp around with us?  It's just gonna get us killed, for cryin' out loud!  I say we roll him down an escalator and run like hell the other way when the zombies go after him.  Who's with me?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal here is to give Lou (and Dierdre and Sylvia) a point toward escape at the cost of you getting a point closer to death.  Hopefully (heh!) they'll turn around later and say something really unreasonable that you can disagree with in turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone shows the stupid, panicking side that zombie-horror requires, and everyone also gets a chance to band together with their friends to let cooler heads prevail, and together they push toward eventual escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is one way of playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, by contrast, you come to it with typical story-game sensibilities, saying to yourself "More even conflicts are <i>better</i> conflicts!" then you'll get two people going up while two people go back, which is pretty well the definition of a zero-sum game for you humans.  Keep that up, and the zombies will over-run you as sure as anything ... but you'll all have a reasonable claim that <i>you</i> were the reasonable one, right before your brains get chewed on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is another way of playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163261/#Comment_163261" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T10:35:06+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 10:35AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, John, were you sacrificing yourself?

So especially early in the game, but arguably throughout the game, you should be looking to find and play through conflicts between characters rather than "the party" versus the zombies.<br><br>Or, as Eero best put it: "Zombie Cinema is a story game because it puts the characters in an untenable position.

Towards the end of the game, that would have been very useful!<br/>\n<br/>\nTony and Judd, makes perfect sense!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn't clear to us that we were supposed to create characters or situations where we were so often and so quickly antagonistic towards each other till much later in the game. At first the conflicts I was bringing to the table felt very forced and artificial. But I suspect we had too much build up. If we we ended scenes where there was no conflict after say 1-2 minutes, then we would have gone around the table quicker, and the zombie token could have started it's march towards us which would have created more tension and reasons for screwing each other. We had 5 players and it felt like it took the zombie token a very long time to move. Our total game lasted around 2 and half hours. Although that also seems to fall in line with the 30 minutes per player estimate.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan, I'll check out that article and then respond back here with thoughts. Many of us who played also have played Geiger Counter in the past and didn't have the same issues. In the version of Geiger Counter we played, when you frame a scene, you aren't framing from your own character's perspective. Also, the order you take turns is more flexible. Both differences seemed pretty key to me for a GMless game. But there are many factors!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163273/#Comment_163273" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T11:02:37+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 11:02AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played this game (though I think it sounds cool and I hope I can sometime) but can I assume it's both possible and reasonable to have conflicts that have <i>nothing to do with the zombies whatsoever</i>?

But rules wise, character creation seemed to create characters that were dumb asses (but funny) that we wouldn't mind seeing killed. But beyond that, we didn't have any positive or negative connections to each other to work off of. And with 5 players, the pressure the zombies presented at the beginning of the game felt small and far away. It felt like we had to do most of the heavy lifting to get the game going and build a situation appropriate to the mechanics to then feedback and help push the story forward till things reached a more synchronous fiction meets mechanics rhythm.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we could have been doing something wrong. I don't want to judge any game based on a con game. Is there anything else to the initial set up beyond draw 3 cars, imagine a character inspired by those cards, and then start framing the first scene?<br/>\n<br/>\nEric, we will game one day!

This is because of the game's background as a roleplaying kata (I explained this to many demoees: I originally wrote the game to teach protagonism), but also because in the context of this sort of social situation I very much believe that the satisfaction of success is integral to the game experience - it is absolutely <i>exhilarating</i> to stand up from the game and realize that your skills, your friends and a simple game have made this excellent story. Thus the game allows for some leeway in approach and does not include any advice for play, but only rules.<br><br>Now, what this means is that Zombie Cinema is not so much like a jukebox than it is a guitar: you need to bring in some techniques and skill to it yourself, because you are answering a question of narrative theory: how do I make these characters appealing and this story engaging? You have complete freedom as an individual to figure out a personal answer to this, and as a group you will work to develop teamwork that benefits the common goals of play. It is not random that I left the notion of relationship mapping the characters out of the game, for example; it's an excellent idea for an individual character's interest and survivability to have some existing relationships with the other characters, but this does not mean that all characters should have such relationships. Furthermore, <i>you can play successfully without those relationships</i> by working up other sources of motivation, characterization and sympathy; thus relationship mapping is not a required rule in this game that only presents the minimal, required rules and leaves matters of play strategy (or technique, as you might call it) up to the players who play it. Part of play is to figure out which techniques you need to make the story successful. I've often played an intentionally isolated character myself to set up adversity or outsiders in an otherwise well-connected group of characters. Something like this often grows out of the setting, as when we played a Haiti-based voodoo zombie game and all but one of the characters were natives to the island.<br><br>Coincidentally, I'm going to write some strategy articles for the game on our website soon. Just like a boardgame, <i>Zombie Cinema</i> only presents the objective, absolute rules of the game in the rules booklet, leaving matters of preference and technique for deeper sources. So there is going to be technique advice, it's just not in there mixed with the rules. I encourage anybody else who's taken a look at the rules to give some hints out as well - that's why it's "advice" and not "rules".<br><br>(Expect that article this month; I can't say for sure, as I have a horrible after-con rush going on here.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163481/#Comment_163481" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T19:32:17+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  7:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for some details:\n<ul>\n<li>The purpose of the game is to enjoy creating a story with your friends. The <i>characters</i> are most likely trying to escape with their lives, but even that can change as the game proceeds and the characters are revealed - the sacrifice mechanic is there explicitly so you can choose to have your character endanger their well-being for some other priorities, and there are other places where characters act for anything but self-preservation. So while concentrating on character survival is a very useful compass when you learn the game (you can't go much wrong in your actions that way, really), you're also free to discard this priority and strive for other things if you want.</li>\n<li>The rules of the game have not changed much at all for the last year (most of the changes have been in very minor, theoretical points), but I noticed at Gencon that there are all sorts of interesting mis-interpretations floating around, perhaps because of a hasty translation we made last year. I recommend reading the rules booklet carefully, I put it together very carefully.</li>\n<li>It's theoretically possible for all characters to survive the story if you have more than the minimum number of players. You just need to have lots of uneven conflicts; like Tony said, the average net of those conflicts is positive, so with any luck the group will overall be moving up. In practice I dearly hope that individual characters will come to have their own concerns and priorities which drive them to betray others and complicate this "optimal game plan". Zombie movies are very much about character thinking that they can take the zombie threat less seriously and even benefit from it; this is not a false promise in this game, as if you choose your conflicts right, you can be completely selfish and still fight your way up to escape over the bodies of the other characters.</li>\n<li>If you don't want your character to escape, sacrifice to move backwards. Note that the sacrifice narration is optional.</li>\n<li>As the rules say, "Each player creates his character for the game by drawing some Cinema Cards. One of each color is traditional, but the players are free to take more or less, or trade cards with others to their satisfaction." What this means is that the cards are not a rules-constraint, but a tool for players to utilize as they see fit. The topics of the cards have been toned to represent typical character concepts in zombie movies - note that you can interpret and deviate from the cards freely in the basic game.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the rules for game set-up are intentionally free-form: it's up to the group to decide how much situation they want to front-load. If there is a GM-type player in the game and he suspects that the others need it, it's completely feasible for him to start the game off by having a pre-prepared situation to start with. The point is, as I try to communicate above, this stuff is about the technique of play, not about rules issues, which is why I don't discuss this in the rules booklet.</li>\n<li>Per the rules, players are very much not required to frame scenes for their own characters. It is completely feasible (with some good strategic reasons, too) to frame scenes with other characters, or even ones that don't have characters at all. Story integrity is much more important than just getting your own character into a scene (if you don't care about story integrity, at least remember that other players might, and annoying them is not likely to increase the survivability of your character), so I often see players framing good scenes for the other players purely in a gamemasterly mode of thought.</li>\n<li>It's a good idea to make the conflicts between the characters be believable and interesting, and your character's participation understandable and human, as those are the qualities the other players are expecting. The zombies need not be concerned in the conflicts or any other narration at all, either - the only place where the zombies <i>must</i> come up are conflict ties. Characters can even die without zombie involvement, if you read the rules carefully. All this means that, technically, the role of the zombies in the story can be really minor if nobody is particularly interested in working with them.</li>\n</ul>\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions about the game. This, at least, is one topic on which I have complete confidence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163510/#Comment_163510" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T21:37:53+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  9:37PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Euro, <br><br>Thank you!

However, <i>for me</i> it's a clear joy to go into the game blind and then create a story by feel. It's nice to throw things at the game and then, around the middle of the story, to figure out what it's <i>actually</i> about. It's like you're storyboarding with your friends, except that nobody is planning anything. Ouija board story creation, in a sense. This is the same sort of entertainment that <i>Universalis</i> gives when played from a dramatic viewpoint.<br><br>When we want to be more structured around here, we just spend a bit more time pre-play in figuring out the premise of the scenario. There's a huge difference between, say, a "licence game" like the one time when we played Jurassic Park in the game, and a totally blind undertaking where you just have a one-sentence setting and go into chargen.<br><br>A note on play technique: do <i>not</i> be afraid to pass on your turn if you don't have any ideas and nobody is suggesting anything. That rule is there for a reason. Another note on technique: think of the first scenes not as significant in terms of escaping from the zombies - they're not. Rather, the first scenes are there for you to set up your character in the minds of the audience. So use those scenes for establishing character motivation, and don't worry about whether you get conflicts or not. Remember that your job as the active player is to close the scene when it has ran it's course. Remind others to close their scenes when the pertinent stuff has been dealt with - even if that means the scene is just a bit of flavor with no free character play at all.<br><br>I've been thinking that it wouldn't be that difficult to create adventure modules for Zombie Cinema, if that sort of thing were needed. Basicly you'd just have a sheet of bangs and a pre-thought idea about why the zombies are there, what they do and so on. I believe that sort of thing could be rather entertaining, and perhaps require less creative energy from the players.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164335/#Comment_164335" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T05:23:33+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  5:23AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Euro!

I have your typical hobbyist game designer background, just like most Forge folks - a game or two under my belt, several years of designing into private folders and such. Probably the most notable bit about me is that I'm either a bum or a full-time designer/author (as opposed to having a real job) - depends on whether this is just a phase I'm going through, I guess. Apart from Zombie Cinema, my other current project is rewriting <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, in case you didn't hear about that one. After that I'm going to go back to <i>Eleanor's Dream</i>, which is my real game that is going to convince people that I'm not only good-looking, but smart as well. I've introduced the latter at the Forge at some point.<br><br>As for the BGG entry, Joachim Erdtman told me that he made it. I'm going to send him some images for the entry as well when Jari gets back to Finland and is again available for this sort of stuff.
