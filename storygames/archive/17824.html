In abstract terms, the conversation at the table usually follows this cycle:<br/><br/><i>Player: "something-fiction-something"<br/>MC: "rules-check!"<br/>Player: *blinks* *rolls dice*<br/>Dice: *whisper to the player*<br/>Player: "something-rules"<br/>MC: "rules-something-fiction"<br/>Player: "something-fiction-something"</i><br/>...<br/><br/>Because of how the MC just raises a flag when the player says something, the move being triggered may feel like a buzzer going off in the middle of the conversation. It's nice to know you said something of note, but the buzzer is not adding anything to what you were saying. Also, once you realize that the buzzer is there, you have this temptation to play with it and you may even start to say whatever serves as an excuse to mess with the dice. Now, what happens if we get rid of the rules-check flag and just let the MC roll?<br/><br/><i>Player: "something-fiction-something"<br/>MC: *blinks* *rolls dice*<br/>Dice: *whisper to the MC*<br/>MC: "rules-something-fiction"<br/>Player: "something-fiction-something"</i><br/>...<br/><br/>In the first situation, the MC essentially tells the player who is talking to him to talk to the dice. In the second situation, the MC talks to the dice about something the player told him. The buzzer is still going off but the temptation to play around with it is minimized. I know, I know, playing with dice is fun and you can even get some XP if you roll an highlighted stat, but I'm just wondering about how we are flowing between the fiction and the rules as we interact in these APGs.<br/><br/>Imagine we're having a conversation at some nice party and you're saying something particularly interesting. What situation seems more natural to you?<br/><br/>1. I tell you to send a message to a mutual friend of ours to tell him what you told me, tell me what he responds and then I respond to what you were saying.<br/><br/>2. I take a moment to send a message to a mutual friend of ours to tell him what you told me and then I respond to you based on what he told me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403421/#Comment_403421" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T06:07:15+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  6:07AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2013 6:07AM by biffboff.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                              This reminds me of Gary Gygax in Futurama : "Hello.

I understand that some RPG's are run this way, the argument being that the dice mess with the Player's immersion. Personally, I've never met Players who wouldn't want to roll their own dice. It gives the illusion of control; let's face it, if your life was hanging on the roll of a die, would you want some-one else to roll for you - in secret no less!<br/><br/>  Having said that, in my own game, I make a distinction between Challenges and Tests. A Challenge is any action that carries with it the possibility of immediate Harm and is rolled by the Player. A Test (of knowledge, social skill, perception, etc) may result in a little or a lot of info, have long term consequences, or may otherwise show that there is more going on than the dice indicate and is rolled in secret (sorta).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403422/#Comment_403422" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T06:17:05+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  6:17AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>   I'm assuming the MC would roll the dice in secret (otherwise, what does it matter who's hand they fall from?) .</blockquote>\nNo secret rolls and I'm not talking about immersion, but indeed that is what I'm asking, what effect does it have in an APG.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403427/#Comment_403427" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T07:31:12+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  7:31AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanically? Nothing, probably. It's tactile reinforcement of the fact that it's the player that does stuff, I think.<br/><br/>If you bring a knife to a game, stab it into the table and then never use it again, it's not going to change any proceedings mechanics-wise, but it is going to change the social dynamic at the table, and thus the game itself. Right?<br/><br/>The "buzzer" effect is intentional, or at least positive, I think. It provides pauses to the conversation. It's not like real conversations are endless chatting, right? You talk, and then you reach some kind of an important question, you ruminate on it for a bit before replying, you wave your arms around and gesture to emphasize your words, you nod in agreement. Slight interuptions in the 'flow' of conversation are natural and maybe even what makes it followable.<br/><br/>Anyhoo. A MC-rolls game is completelly viable if you're aiming for a different sort of agency than in the AW model, though, if the game requires you to be more passive and reactive. Horror might be a good genre for it - it'd give the "something is happening to you!" instead of the "one of the protagonists is doing something important!" beat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403428/#Comment_403428" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T07:53:21+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  7:53AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But isn't rolling dice reactive in APGs?

That\u2019s always the player\u2019s choice. For example, the player might backtrack in the fiction, taking a different course of action that doesn\u2019t trigger that move (or maybe triggers a different move). That decision, and the conversation about how exactly the character makes a move are really important to the AW communication protocol \u2013 it\u2019s the handshake where the GM says, \u201cYep, you\u2019re making the right move and you\u2019re clear to roll dice\u201d and then the player picks up the dice and rolls them. The conversation, by necessity, shifts from \u201cthis is what my character is doing in the fiction right now\u201d to \u201cthis is specifically how my character is making the move.\u201d That\u2019s a disruption of the conversation about the fiction; but, it\u2019s an important part of how making moves in AW works. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that can be \u201cfixed.\u201d It\u2019s a feature of the AW system - like how there\u2019s always the pause in D&amp;D while the player integrates the system of partial differential equations that determines the outcome of swinging their axe. Within the scope of AW, I think you just have to work to maximize the fluidity and continuity of the move-making disruption.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403437/#Comment_403437" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T09:41:18+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  9:41AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2013 11:31AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree mostly with Paul about why the moves are structured that way. Also, AW is partially the product of a series of thoughts and experiments conducted (at least, from what I remember from the Anyway blog posts that proceeded it) about <i>what feels fair and unfair</i> in GM-player interactions. If the GM gives the players a "fair shot" and lets them roll the dice, then it doesn't feel unfair when the GM does something terrible afterwards, for example. Likewise, if you "threaten badness" and then follow through with it, you gave the players "fair warning." So there's an awful lot in AW that's focused on GM-player interactions and how to make those feel a certain way.<br/><br/>That said, in an AW hack, anything is potentially up for grabs. I can think of a lot of situations where the GM rolling dice might be a good idea. Rolling dice, like you say, all the time is also certainly an option. But it will dramatically change the feel of the game. Like Paul says, you'll have to worry about the GM assuming players have committed to a path of action that they may not be 100% on board with, and about the results of the roll not seeming "fair" because the player didn't roll the dice themselves. But if your game is about, let's say, being horrible oppressed and in an uncertain environment and not having time to think clearly about what to do next, then sure, that could be the appropriate choice. But it's important to be aware of the ramifications of those kinds of tweaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403446/#Comment_403446" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T10:22:59+00:00" title="January 11, 2013 10:22AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Paul and Jonathan said, Apocalypse World is leveraging a lot of <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2011/05/26/compliance-techniques-and-rpg-design/" rel="nofollow">human</a> <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2011/05/27/compliance-techniques-and-rpg-design-2/" rel="nofollow">psychology</a> to make things that happen in the fiction of the game seem credible to the participants. You can't say "game A is functionally equivalent to game B" if it requires you to treat humans as black boxes rather than creatures with brains that work in particular ways. Player-rolled dice is one of the elements of AW's game design that helps it work. For example, having the player roll the dice is a strong acknowledgement from the player that they are indeed agreeing to the rules procedure set out by whatever move they're invoking, and that they're buying-in to the possible range of results. Having "fictional triggers" for the moves serves to orient all of the players and the GM toward treating "<a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/12/31/in-rpgs-the-fiction-is-a-convenient-fiction/" rel="nofollow">the fiction</a>" as the basis of what's happening in the game rather than the viewing the game as dependent on the potentially arbitrary and capricious opinion of a single individual.

Some indeed are not even triggered by fiction, some moves may overlap in certain situations, some rolls may depend on the player expending resources, some results may call upon the player to make a choice, etc. However, all of this still gets to happen while the MC is holding the dice, so perhaps this is more of a usability question than one of system, but it's nevertheless a design decision that affects the game. <br/><br/>Why do we tell the MC to "say yes or roll the dice" and then hand those dice to the player? Is it indeed a matter of perceived agency or fairness that is being symbolically reinforced? If it is, aren't those concerns being raised precisely because we are by default putting ourselves outside the fictional space? Inside the fiction, the MC is already constrained by the moves he has and therefore he is forced to let the players have the initiative and the time to do what they want. Regarding overlapping moves, are we saying that having the MC roll the dice forces the group to spend more time exploring the fiction until a distinction can be made on which move the player is aiming for? Perhaps it does, but is that a bad thing?<br/><br/><i>Quick note: Again, I'm not talking about character immersion. Being inside the fiction is not the same as being in-character.

You're thinking of a different game, maybe. There's no "say yes or roll the dice" in <i>Apocalypse World</i>. In AW, the rule is "to do it, do it", i.e. that if you do the move in the fiction you must do the mechanical part of it, and if you do the mechanical part of it you must do the fictional part of it.

Players don't get access to any out-of-game numbers or information. So, if you're playing the Warrior playbook, of course you're going to know that you're good at fighting, but not the exact probabilities.<br/><br/>For most of the game, this works fine: you say what you're doing or trying to do, and the GM describes the result. Many things will be automatically successful\u2014there's a very strong idea of saying yes to reasonable player ideas, especially when the characters aren't under immediate pressure. The problem was with things that *were* uncertain: you rolled dice, but had no idea what those die rolls meant, which was immensely frustrating for a whole raft of reasons. But if the die mechanic were explained, it would be too easy to calculate the probabilities and start thinking out-of-game.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think <i>Delve</i> really wants to be a game of principled freeform, which is what the Apocalypse Engine actually is (articulated brilliantly once by Jonathan Walton). But having the GM roll the dice, and handle all numerical aspects of the game, while challenging, would solve the problem of thinking out-of-character. (Even though AW is fiction-first, it's pretty easy to describe something that'll let you roll your best stat once you understand how the game works.)<br/><br/>Dave has actually come up with a new solution for his combat system that I like even better than using AW as a base, but I'll let him (hopefully) talk about that elsewhere soon, because it is fucking rocktacular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403754/#Comment_403754" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T14:13:24+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  2:13PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2013 2:15PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, now I feel the need to offer the disclaimer that I just clicked into this thread based on the title.  I had no idea my stuff would get mentioned here (I'm the <i>Delve</i> guy).  Probably a sign that there's some natural overlapping interest here.  (Matt, yes!  I will rant at some point.)<br/><br/>Ricardo, I think it would be great if your suggestion could get people to stop fiddling with the buzzer.  I think that would fundamentally transform the game, though, and would impact who'd enjoy it.  I have a lot more gamer friends who are comfortable with "I suss the odds and roll the die and do the math and determine success" than I do friends who are totally happy to let the GM do that.  And if they're not <i>totally</i> happy, then this is what will happen:<br/><br/><i>Player: "something-fiction-something"<br/>MC: *blinks* *rolls dice*<br/>Dice: *whisper to everyone at the table* </i> (you said no secret rolls!)<br/><i>MC: "rules-something-fiction"<br/>Player: *stares at dice to double-check*</i><br/><br/>So we're still interrupting the natural flow of the conversation at the party.  <br/><br/>Here's how I see it: the only way you just keep the conversation rolling is to avoid distracting stimulus.  If the die roll matters and is visible, it's distracting.  So, you can either <b>ditch it</b> (if it doesn't matter) or <b>hide it</b> (so it's not visible).  I don't see any other real options.<br/><br/>I suppose it could be argued that my example above is <i>less</i> of an interruption than the APG system, but it doesn't strike me as significant enough to bother.  The one case in which I could see it as valuable is as training wheels for freeform -- where you have a group whose <i>goal</i> is to play with no dice visible, but <i>first</i> they need proof that the GM isn't just making up whatever they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403776/#Comment_403776" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T20:44:22+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  8:44PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2013 8:45PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But having the GM roll the dice, and handle all numerical aspects of the game, while challenging, would solve the problem of thinking out-of-character.

The confusion and frustration often comes when the player (and sometimes the GM) don't understand how the game rules define what a character is good at, thinking "This fighter is good at this, because fighters are good at fighting!" and then discovering too late that in this particular game a character needs X, Y, and Z to be good at fighting, but somehow their character ended up knowing only X and Y and they're actually awful at fighting (and at everything else).<br/><br/>I mean, game systems are all a little weird, so at some point it helps to be able to peek under the hood and see what exactly is going on. Even if you hide the specifics of the rules from the players during the actual game in order to avoid out-of-character distractions, understanding them up front is an extremely powerful tool for figuring out how to play your character well. Just being able to suss out that your character isn't actually very good at a particular task lets you play that scene with false bravado or visible trepidation or whatever, and gives more texture to your eventual failure or success.<br/><br/>(And it beats the <i>hell</i> out of the vague suspicion that you screwed up epically during character creation in ways that you cannot even understand.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403779/#Comment_403779" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T21:06:57+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  9:06PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man, this makes wonder whether some kind of randomizer/technique could be used as a purely oracular device.

In AW proper, your stats are highlighted by the MC and another player, specifically giving you a carrot for hitting moves that derive from those stats. That, coupled with the playbook structure, reinforces how you play a playbook and who your character is. The dice and the moves are meant to influence the fiction. They are meant to give your character with their playbook a focused direction.The game systematically encourages you make specific moves at a meta game level because that's what your character is supposed to do.<br/><br/>That's a strength of AW's design: focusing play around a theme by strongly coupling the mechanics to the fiction.<br/><br/>AW is not a voyage of discovering the delicate flower that is your character's inner child. We're not left to wonder whether your character is or is not likely to succeed at something. You know your stats, you know your character's ambition, when you make a move you pick up the dice and roll them: then we see what happens. <br/><br/>And, let's face it, the AW probability math is really not that hard.

The categories for which you roll are broad enough that, yes, the fighter really is going to be good at fighting; he doesn't have to make sure he picks the right feat combos or whatever. (We're putting Moves/Advancement choices in the hands of the GM, based on what the character has been up to.) Anyway, for someone mathematically savvy, even seeing the numbers once, combined with the basic 2d6+stat system, would be enough to internalize them. I think this experiment really does require the players <i>never</i> to see their character's stats.<br/><br/>Ooooooh, you know, if you really wanted to minimize dice-rolling, you could just auto-generate on Excel or whatever a list of 100 2d6 rolls, and cross 'em off one at a time.

Though, of course, the player could say things like "I'm doing something something and I think that triggers rules rules, yeah?" if the MC isn't chiming in with the call for a roll. Plus, the MC needs to be mentally ready to respond with results to a roll.<br/><br/>With an MC-rolls-everything model, the MC needs to do all that, plus remembering how all the moves work (including moves with special results), plus the character's stats, plus whether they have a +1 forward or something that applies. And still be ready to respond to the roll and maybe make up some interesting consequences to a fail.<br/><br/>Yes, some of that is fixable using office supplies, etc. You can put character stats on name cards, for example.<br/><br/>But that doesn't completely solve the fact that you're asking the MC to do more logistics brainwork. While they're already doing lots of creative brainwork stuff.<br/><br/>I don't see the benefit of removing the sense (false though it may be) of empowerment that comes with rolling your dice for your move, as well as removing the opportunity for clarity ("do you really want to Sieze By Force?") in return for more MC stress.<br/><br/>Only in the case of a game like the above described Delve setup, where you're using it to completely blackbox the mechanics and create an entirely different effect, do I see a potential benefit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403829/#Comment_403829" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T15:48:51+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  3:48PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, Rob.

They wanted to get started *right away*, no dallying. So, while I let them roll the dice, they didn't really know which moves were being or what. (For many moves, there's no need to show them the full text, since the only time they need to know how the move works is if they roll a 7-9 and need to choose options or something similar).<br/><br/>So, effectively, the game was fairly similar to a blackbox GM kind of situation, although the players rolled the dice. However, that illusion wouldn't last long, since the players do have the character sheets in front of them and would eventually learn all about all the moves by exploring them.<br/><br/>Another way of obscuring odds (if that's one of the design goals) is just to use a mechanic that's very hard to estimate, like a complex combination of dice, or drawing cards from a deck (without foreknowledge of what cards are in the deck, or in what proportions).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403840/#Comment_403840" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T17:44:05+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  5:44PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2013 5:45PM by creases.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, for whatever that's worth, rolling the dice in Apocalypse World doesn't break immersion---rather, it ramps up the tension, because rolls become something you don't make until you can't avoid them. My players avoided rolls they were bad at, and they tried to position the fiction so that, if everything's going to hang on a roll, it will be a roll they're good at. So we wound up making fewer rolls, but it really felt like those rolls mattered more, and what they meant for the fiction was very clear, like "hold your breath while you roll" clear. The players were making calculated risks that reflected their comfort zones. As an MC, I found this behaviour really rewarding to see, and I'm afraid it would be lost if all the moves were MC-facing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404021/#Comment_404021" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T17:30:42+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  5:30PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the idea was to simply enjoy the notion of fuzzy control, where you state some fiction and hope that activates the power you wanted.
