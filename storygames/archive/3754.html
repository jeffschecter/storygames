Of WGP, I know only the following for sure:\n<ul>\n<li>There are superheroes</li>\n<li>The superheroes have to suffer on a personal level to "win" (thus, "With Great Power...")</li>\n</ul>\nThis is probably a one-shot, perhaps 6 hours or so long, and I doubt there will be any "pre-gens" of any kind. So, what can I expect and what mindset should I be in to enjoy the game? Should I expect nothing but character creation and perhaps a few "colour" scenes? If character creation is quick, what sort of game could feasibly be run in the next 4 hours or so? Should I be setting myself up to "lose", due to the mechanics of the game preventing me from "winning" in the short time span we have? If so, how do I make that "losing" scene really work? Are there any crucial mechanics I should really, really know up front, before sitting down at the table?<br/><br/>Note that I use quotes extensively in this post, to indicate that "winning" and "losing" pertains to the character's success, not to my fun. I'm all for having my dude fail horribly if that is what is expected of me.<br/><br/>Any advice appreciated!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84047/#Comment_84047" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T09:27:14+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  9:27AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Push hard but know when to give!

You will need at least a 20 minute break after that to look at all the characters and create villains in opposition to them that have needs based on the heroes' aspects. <br/><br/>You will not be able to play a "full game". If anything, it will be a teaser. You will probably be able to get about halfway on the Comic Story Flow Chart thing, but not to the end.<br/><br/>Remember that the villains are nothing more than guys with plans who REQUIRE the players' aspects in some way. If you make a generic villain(s) with goals outside of those character aspects, then the game will not run well.<br/><br/>Also, remember that with NPCs, you should often have scenes where other players play background NPCs or henchmen/villains. Don't just let the other players sit there and do nothing, give them NPCs to roleplay. In fact, in playing I find that in a scene with one Hero, I will more likely than not NOT roleplay the antagonist or major NPC in the scene.  I will assign that role to another player, and as GM will do nothing more than watch the players roleplay in front of me, calling for a conflict if one emerges. This is expressly in the rules, but I forget it often.<br/><br/>If you want to have a game that goes further and a villain pre-created where the players don't have to wait around, I suggest doing the following:<br/><br/>1) For every two players, have only one hero. The playing of that hero will drift back and forth between players. Less heroes, more focused game.<br/><br/>2) Or, better yet, contact all players via email. Have them give you ideas for their characters in alignment with the rules. You stat out all their heroes for them. You also come up with villains that address the heroes' aspects (better yet, the players' focus aspects). Do this all before Saturday. That way you can drop right into play without wasting time.<br/><br/>I'm playing WGP bi-weekly, and it is one of the most fulfilling roleplaying experiences I've had in the last two years. However, we are in it for a multi-month campaign (probably 6 sessions total, in two days is Play Session Three), and we had one session where we did nothing but create characters, then play board games afterwards (I made the villains in between sessions). It's a great game, but I think it really shines for me when I took my time with it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84062/#Comment_84062" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T10:05:23+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 10:05AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, you can easily do it as a one shot and finish. I don't have the book with me, so I don't remember exactly what it's called, but if I remember correctly, Michael provides some optional rules for the Story Arc mechanic depending on the amount of time you expect to play. Allow each card spent on the Story Arc to cover two spaces in the arc rather than just one, and you should be good to go.<br/><br/>Other pointers:<br/>1. Everyone should try to keep The Struggle you select in mind. For best results, it should inform all your choices and scenes. When your aspects Suffer, they should Suffer in a way that informs the Struggle.<br/><br/>2. Don't skimp on Enrichment Scenes. Conflict Scenes are big and splashy and fun, but Enrichment Scenes are the real meat/soy protein of the game. Push for interesting issues and dynamic stakes. The player should have a difficult choice between sacrificing a good card to get his preferred outcome, or playing low in the hopes of winning a good card from the GM.<br/><br/>3. Try to get the group to talk about their favorite comics before doing character creation. What really gets their engines going? What shuts them down? You want to try to get everyone on the same page and excited. What is your comics universe like?<br/><br/>4. Definitely chat about penciling, coloring and inking beforehand! With Great Power gives players a lot of power over the look and content of scenes, even when their characters are nowhere to be found. Don't ignore it; revel in it! Talk about what a panel looks like on the page, how it's bursting out of the frame, the color and shape of the text boxes, etc.<br/><br/>5. Make extensive use of the Thought Balloon. The Thought Balloon is a fantastic way of introducing internal conflict into a role-playing game. Internal conflict is generally very difficult to do in a role-playing game, but it's fantastic in With Great Power. Use it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84072/#Comment_84072" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T10:18:25+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 10:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always get excited when I hear people are playing With Great Power!

You have to lose enrichment scenes and get sand kicked in your face in order to get more cards. With more cards, you have a better chance of winning that next conflict if you really want to aim for the Win (near the end of the game).<br/><br/>I wish it could function without 4+ decks of playing cards, as that gets quite the handful. But still, it works.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84075/#Comment_84075" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T10:29:15+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 10:29AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are definitely a lot of cards in play.

Since I published the game, I've started to make my villain's Plans differently than outlined in the book. Instead of taking the players' Strife Aspects and retreating off by myself to think up some devious way of transforming them that might <i>or might not</i> excite the players, I instead create the villian's Plans right there at the table. The HUGE advantage of this is that it allows me to see the players' reactions to my ideas. I'll say something like "If I succeed at my plan, I'll transform your Duty 'Defender of Truth' to 'Perpetrator of Lies.' " Then, I listen to the players' reaction. If they're not excited by the Plan, I try something else. I've found that open Plans--including occasionally accepting player suggestions for how to transform their own, or another player's Aspect--works much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, for a time-limited game, each player should have FOUR Aspects, <b>maximum.</b> Possibly even three, since you're making characters at the table. Let everyone know that their characters can have more story stuff than those three Aspects, but that the rest doesn't particularly matter for this story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84247/#Comment_84247" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T09:18:11+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  9:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, for such a short game, I'd almost suggest using only 2 aspects, three absolute maximum.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84330/#Comment_84330" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T12:41:40+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 12:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You need atleast 3 Aspects even in a one shot -one of each type: <b>Asset </b>(your power): <b>Relationship </b>(who you do it for):<b>Motivation </b>(why you dot it).<br/><br/>I run many one shot convention games and the characters have 4 aspects.

At least one of us will be writing an AP report, and I'll be sure to link to it here.<br/><br/>As a teaser, this is what's been brainstormed so far (and none of this is set in stone (or ink, as it were) yet):<br/><br/>Struggle: Belonging vs Responsibility (in the sense that characters are inhuman and struggle to belong in a world that shuns them, while simultaneously trying to protect those same people - trying to become more human will make their powers suffer, while becoming more powerful will further separate them from humanity)<br/><br/>Tone: "Under New Proprietor". Our characters were originally cheesy 60's heroes - "Weather Girl" and "Math Man" have been suggested so far - whose comics got canceled. The publisher has given the old characters over to a new, edgy writer whose job is to bring the old properties into the current comic scene. We're going for something like Grant Morrison's "Doom Patrol" and "The Invisibles".<br/><br/>Heroes: So far, we have:<br/>* Weather Girl, who upon her death transfers her consciousness into a storm, and re-emerges as the Storm Witch - an amnesiac super-heroine with weather control powers, trying to work through an existential crisis, and<br/>* Math Man, a professor who transfers his consciousness into a piece of silicon, which he has re-implanted into his brain, giving him amazing powers of mathematical prediction as well as the ability to induce and control low-current electricity. Rewritten as Doctor Monotone, a digital consciousness controlling his former body - internally referred to as Meat - like a stilted hand puppet while trying to pass himself off as a living human being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
