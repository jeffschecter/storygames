What's the thought process behind that if you don't mind me asking?</cite><br/><br/>Kevin and I observed, over our couple of years at the Forge Booth, that demo's didn't really sell our games. Or, to be more precise, the number of games sold on a given day didn't really seem to sync up with demos given. Also, while actually conducting demo's is fun, both of us find the process of getting people to sit down to demo painful and awkward.<br/><br/>Design Matters is about creating an atmosphere that attracts customers that we think will enjoy our games. A demo table is chaotic and messy, and without having to (a) ensure everyone is able to potentially demo every game and (b) have space somewhere in the booth to store demo kits and materials, we avoid a lot of headaches. <br/><br/>So that's our reasoning, and it works for us! I'm not saying "don't demo at Gen Con", by any means. But it's like a game design, y'know - who's your audience, how will demos or lack thereof change their experience, it is in pursuit of your goals, etc.<br/><br/>Oh, I'm also not saying that actual play doesn't sell games. It absolutely does (see Harper for 3:16, Adam Dray for Annalise, etc). But, in the vast majority of cases, 10-minute convention demos are not actual play.<br/><br/>So....there's that. I'm happy to discuss!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230178/#Comment_230178" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T07:48:12+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  7:48AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that I'd call it actual play.

But I hear what you're saying about how getting people to sit down can be painful.<br/><br/>I guess I can see how, for many games, just teaching the basic mechanics is really a misrepresentation of the game.

But in 40 minutes, you can really communicate a game in a way that you can't in 10 minutes. I think, at least. <br/><br/>Jeremy - Here's a thing. The year a game debuts, it almost always sells pretty well at Gen Con. People want the new hotness, that's why they're there. And you have a great-looking, grabby product that seems to me like it's probably always going to sell well from the shelf. I absolutely am not trying to say that your experience is wrong, or that your demos weren't selling your game - I wasn't there! And demoing sure doesn't hurt your sales. But I am saying that, sure, I sold a bunch of carry the year it came out at Gen Con. The next year, both myself and Ron were demoing it (Ron even more than me, actually), and it sold about half that. Same deal with Primitive, it moved pretty well when it debuted, and then it really didn't sell much in year 2 despite demo efforts.<br/><br/>It's a complicated thing, for sure. But we just want to point out that, for some people and some products, 10-minute booth demos isn't as effective a sales strategy as it can be for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230189/#Comment_230189" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T09:01:44+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  9:01AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2009 10:32AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Nathan P, at least for our games.<br/><br/>At GenCon we run 40 minute demos for 5-6 people. Getting people to sign up is the biggest headache, and we get some no-shows. In a change to our original strategy of concentrating entirely on getting new customers, we also encouraged people who have bought the books but haven't played yet, or those familiar with the system who want to try actual play with an experienced GM. It really gets them primed to play with their group. You could maybe give a flavour of a GUMSHOE game in 15 minutes, but I'm really not sure. Our ideal would be to run a master-class style game for multiple GMs.<br/><br/>That said, demo space in the hall is fantastically expensive, and we'll make more effort to get games in the program book.<br/><br/>This year, though, it was no longer a matter of introducing GUMSHOE, though we were still pitching settings. For Mutant City Blues we had no demos, but with one exception, every person who saw the <a href="http://pelgranepress.com/gumshoe/mutant/quade.html" rel="nofollow">Quade Diagram</a> bought MCB.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230192/#Comment_230192" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T09:12:40+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  9:12AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Universalis's first few years at the Forge booth we were doing 30min demos that routines crept up to 45 and occassionally an hour.  Universalis demos very very well in 45 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we moved to the 15 minute demos...it became literally impossible to demo Uni effectively.  The game doesn't have that one key hook or super sweet mechanic that sells it.  You have to see all the pieces meshing together over a couple of scenes to realize what it does.  Sales plummetted...and finally I just stopped even trying to run Uni demos at the Forge Booth.  It was pointless.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, whatever demo strategy you go with, it has to be one that works to showcase the game effectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230193/#Comment_230193" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T09:22:30+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  9:22AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2009 9:24AM by Elizabeth.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really confused by the whole demo thing the year It's Complicated came out. I didn't think a ten-minute demo could accurately reflect the fun of the way that the engine builds weird, three-dimensional characters throughout the course of play, which I think is one of the major selling points of the game. PlayCollective was the anti-Design-Matters in that no, you had to have a demo, no matter what. Tony LB, who is the demo KING, helped me design a cute little demo of IC that, while it didn't follow the rules exactly, definitely helped carry the spirit of the game to potential buyers. (That was another point of confusion for me: the demoed rules don't have to be the same? Won't that confuse the players when they sat down to play the game for real?) I had a lot of people buy the game when I wasn't at the booth and then come back for demos. That also really confused me-- wait, demoing is a sales tool, and you want me to run a ten-minute example of play that isn't even exactly what you bought? Why? I was happy to, but there was always this niggling feeling in the back of my head that selling my game to people who had already bought it was not the best use of my energy.<br><br>I asked people about that, too. "Oh, some people just want to play the new games with the designers." <br>"If they said something, I'd run it after the hall closed," I replied. <br>"Oh, well, people tend to have full plates after hours, they might not want to play it then," was the response I got.<br/><br/>That's when I got it. Oh. Demos are a really, really shitty replacement for actual play. Some people like that can say they played a game without actually having to play it. Even if what they played for ten minutes had completely different procedures.<br/><br/>I don't know. I really enjoyed having the full ten minutes to goof off with new friends and sell them on my game, but the physical demoing of the game itself is something I really regret. I think it's probably one of the reasons IC showed up so much in that "What games have you bought and keep meaning to play but don't" thread that happened a while ago.<br/><br/>I should have found the people who actually wanted to play my game and actually run it for them, and just glad-handed everyone else.<br/><br/>(Note to people I demoed for: I am glad I hung out with you! I do not begrudge you your demo requests! I just wish I'd known a more effective way to spend that time with you.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230194/#Comment_230194" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T09:49:49+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  9:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm glad that we didn't do demos at Design Matters last year (I wasn't there this year).

I'd demo this game in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Diaspora, however, I wouldn't even run a one-shot. It's a multi-session game before the WOW. I might run a single-session mini-game though -- say a space combat chase scene or a boarding action gunfight. I think you could get to WOW. Running a cluster creation and character gen session can probably also get there. But none of these are hitting the moment before minute 40, so I wouldn't demo it.<br/><br/>If your game has a structure that delivers its awesome through completion, a demo sounds risky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230199/#Comment_230199" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T10:32:03+00:00" title="September  5, 2009 10:32AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan P.</cite>I absolutely am not trying to say that your experience is wrong, or that your demos weren't selling your game - I wasn't there!

In order to have adequate staffing to be running demo's plus telling people about games plus actually ringing in customers, you needed lots of booth people. This created the "game designer wall": just across from the booth hovered like 20 designers at any given time. Some talking, some hawking, but all of them gathered in this big storm cloud.<br/><br/>When I showed up to The Forge booth, I knew I had to demo my own game, I knew I should learn how to demo others' games, and I knew it would be a bit action-packed.<br/><br/><br/>Design Matters staffs two people at a given time. We don't run demos or try to rope people into the booth. If you're browsing already, we'll ask how you're doing. If you've got a game in hand, we'll see if you want to talk about it. No hard selling, no pressure. Coupling this with the coffee table &amp; chairs, the menu and the simple design... I think we really created a kind space where people felt at ease.<br/><br/>Different people took that "no hard selling" motto differently. Gregor, for example, would conversationally share his favourite things about a given game, when someone was clearly interested in it. Eppy would often explain something procedural or structural that he thought demonstrated play well.

Take this year at PJ. I am, not to flatter myself, a good sales person, but I had almost no luck on pitching the game on it's merits. It's $12, it adds variant rule sets, an endgame mechanic, a different setting, and it indexes the original Polaris as well. That's a lot of value for just $12.

Over half of all demos in a convention environment turn into sales. This is because the game can be explained concisely in 15 minutes, with some fanciful narrative dropped in, too. The only reasons <i>not</i> to buy in that social situation are because you really don't get the genre or because you're not a storyteller typer person to begin with, and thus can't play something that is basically just people talking to each other. Everybody else seems to buy, if we discount the people who don't have money and are just window shopping.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Solar System is and has always been a difficult game to demonstrate due to how it's basically another powerful generic rpg system for fantasy adventure. Being impressed by the game depends solely on whether you happen to have the same technical aesthetics the designer does. It's possible in principle to sell a game like this with a demo, but what you're doing is just basically talking, talking, talking until the other person gets infected by your enthusiasm and decides to buy the thing out of misplaced empathy. Considering how that technique can be used to sell fridges to eskimos, I don't deem it much of a proof for the efficacy of the Solar System demo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230270/#Comment_230270" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T07:46:29+00:00" title="September  6, 2009  7:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>So how many copies does the typical Design Matters game sell during Gencon?</blockquote>\n2008: 161 discrete sales, 11 products, so on average each sold about 14 or 15.

People either come up asking for a demo, b/c they've heard of the game or they see it on the shelf and it grabs them, and they do it and it's cool and they buy it; or I rope someone in ("hey, wanna play a demo!"), they participate, it's cool and they're not interested regardless. I often had the experience that I had one guy who really wanted to check it out, then roped someone else in, and then (surprise) the one guy bought it and the other didn't.<br/><br/>My philosophy with selling <b>carry</b> is pretty much that it will get to the people that it needs to get to, and I'm not gonna worry too much about it.<br/><br/>But, no, don't throw out the demo as a sales tool! It's one tool in the box, sometimes it's appropriate, sometimes's its not.<br/><br/>For Thou Art But A Warrior, it sounds like there's an additional layer of something going on there that makes the demo work for you. And that's rad. In addition to the "giving yourself permission" thing, I wonder how many people already have Polaris, and wanted to see if there really was any value-added by getting your game. Cuz I bet that's a factor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230273/#Comment_230273" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T08:32:55+00:00" title="September  6, 2009  8:32AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2009 8:36AM by Graham.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure there are some games that don't demo well.

My perception is that the base position is that you must have a 15-min demo for your game, and that people just don't think about whether that is true or not for their game.<br/><br/>So I'd say the default is people obsessing over demos to drive sales, rather than everyone thinking they're a special snowflake who doesn't have to. (it's like how everyone obsessed over having an elevator pitch from 2005 onwards...)<br/><br/>For me I think I could demo my books and get sales, but I've also seen that I can get sales (to different people?) without demoing. Best Friends did 37 on the Forge booth in 06 with demos then 28 the year after when I split my time demoing BF and Dead of Night. I think it benefits from demos, where people can be enthused, have fun in 15 mins and see how to create characters and resolve a simple conflict.<br/><br/>For 3:16 I could do a demo in 15 mins but you'd probably just see how a round of combat works rather than the really hooky stuff, which is how easy it is to GM and levelling up between missions and ongoing play. It's not a cut down version simplified for a demo - it really is that easy.<br/><br/>Demoing is a very useful tool.  Pitching is also a useful tool. As is just leaving shoppers weary of the hard sell alone to browse a menu unflustered to see if there's anything they like. You have to find what's right for your game, you, and the booth. (And whether you're on the right booth for you and your game.)<br/><br/>So I guess we just need to think critically and not fall into the trap of doing stuff "just because".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230304/#Comment_230304" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T15:00:33+00:00" title="September  6, 2009  3:00PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>'m sure there are some games that don't demo well.

I can certainly see someone saying, for GURPS, for example, that virtually everything fun in GURPS happens at a broader scale: designing a campaign, designing and balancing a character able to interact with a highly detailed situation, and so on.  I mean, GURPS is just rolling a few d6s and comparing it to a number.

If you've got 15 minutes to explain your game, are you better off talking about it or demoing it? The answer will vary from game to game. For Mortal Coil, I imagine, talking would be more effective, for Zombie Cinema, demoing. It takes very little time to explain the Mortal Coil world creation method, but a great deal of time to demo it - particularly as a lot of it is brainstorming. That said, there is something special about a demo with the game's designer which is more effective than just a chat.<br/><br/>Looking realistically at our customers at GenCon, though, I'd divide them up into five categories:<br/><br/>1. People who knew what they wanted already, having seen the game online, and are frequently existing customers.<br/>2. People who pick the books up, read the blurb and buy.<br/>3. People we talk about the game to at the stand. It particularly helps if this is the designer.<br/>4. People who are demo'ed to, generally after a pitch .<br/>5. People who buy as a result of their friends pitching them the game at the stand. This one is particularly gratifying.<br/><br/>For a new game, 1 and 5 are non-existent. This year, I think pitch sales outweighed demo sales by a large margin. But, demos aren't just to sell the game; they are to teach the game and spread stories of fun actual play. Playing Ganakagok, for example, has made me an advocate for it, and a willing player, wherease otherwise I don't know if we'd have got round to it.<br/><br/>A really on-the-ball company would mark each sale according to category.<br/><br/>Another thread might be, how would you demo this apparently difficult to demo game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230363/#Comment_230363" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T07:08:00+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  7:08AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's ANOTHER wrinkle - the short (10-15 minute booth demo) has a really specific historical generation. My understanding of the whole thing is that the folks from the Forge looked around Gen Con in, what, 2003-2004ish, and saw that the booths that really attracted attention were the board and card game booths where they were providing said short demos. Ron et. al. said "well, why can't you do a 10 minute RPG demo?". So they did. And it was new and exciting! People were, like, holy crap, I can get a demo of an RPG in 10 minutes? With the designer? WHOA! And it was good.  <br/><br/>Fast forward to, oh, 2007 (which was the second year of my Forge booth attendance, and by then it was the last year of the combined Forge/IPR booth). Everyone going to the booth is required to have a short demo prepared. People for whom the Forge booth is a destination are expecting to received demos of the new games, or old games that they're thinking about getting. In my experience, there were many, many cases where potential customers were expecting to receive a demo simply as part of the booth experience - the demo was one component of their purchasing pattern, but it wasn't the blow-your-socks-off holy crap kind of thing it was when it was new. That is, the "demos-will-sell-your-game" model didn't seem to be as strong as it once had. ALSO, people were coming to the booth having already purchased the game, and wanted to demo so they could learn more about it, or say they played with the designer, or whatever. <br/><br/>As a booth experience, Kevin and I didn't find either of those scenarios to be ones that we wanted happening at Design Matters. We didn't want the cluster of people around tables taking up browsing space, and we didn't want people coming to the booth to get some kind of value other than purchasing product (sorry folks, but being a vendor at Gen Con is about selling stuff, full stop). So, those were other considerations going into the "no demos" plan.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>For a new game, 1 and 5 are non-existent.

If your game is brand new, the need to demo in order to get a sale is higher, I'd argue. I do think building in a <i>expectation</i> of a demo is very counterproductive - you don't want to suggest a demo before the customer has decided not to buy on the basis of a pitch. Sure, when they've bought it, a demo is a good thing, if you have the resources.<br/><br/>I think because we've been demoing CC3 software at cons since 1993, it's a natural thing to provide it as an option. We've learnt not to demo to a certain sale. They'll buy anyway, and it uses up lots of time.<br/><br/>We got a number of MCB sales from one person who was running the game just because they liked it after-hours, and this is really where we have fallen down in the past.

Even better, I'd love to see the events ran at these cons made available for free to the participants so that they can then go home and run the games themselves. A lot of us started going to Origins and Gencon because of the Cthulhu and Shadowrun tournaments.<br/><br/>That being said, one of the reasons these events became popular is that they were known to attract high quality players. The idea was that at a large convention there was a large risk you would play with crappy people. Especially with low common denominator games likes D&amp;D. But Cthulhu master events were almost always a guaranteed safe bet. And in events like these, the GMs were often instructed to watch for charismatic players to invite to eventually become GMs in future events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230468/#Comment_230468" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T20:46:53+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  8:46PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan P.</cite>ALSO, people were coming to the booth having already purchased the game, and wanted to demo so they could learn more about it, or say they played with the designer, or whatever.</blockquote>When I went to GenCon last year, I had one guy who sought me out specifically to demo <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>, which he had bought two years earlier and couldn't make heads or tails of.

My understanding of the whole thing is that the folks from the Forge looked around Gen Con in, what, 2003-2004ish, and saw that the booths that really attracted attention were the board and card game booths where they were providing said short demos. Ron et. al. said "well, why can't you do a 10 minute RPG demo?". So they did. And it was new and exciting! People were, like, holy crap, I can get a demo of an RPG in 10 minutes? With the designer? WHOA! And it was good.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nActually, I don't think that's quite the correct chain of events.  The short board and card game demos were pointed at after the fact as a confirmation of the idea not as the catalyst for the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe catalyst for the idea was much simpler.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early days demos sold.  They sold because The Forge had no Rep.  It had yet to become a GenCon Destination Booth.  The designers had no Rep.  No one came to GenCon with a plan to go to the Forge Booth and buy one of everything.  The game were completely outside the norm.  So the original demos served several purposes, among them:  1) Proof that this actually a real game you can play. 2) Providing a relaxed atmosphere where folks could take a load off for a while as long as they agreed to sit through a 30-45 minute sales pitch for a game they otherwise didn't know existed.  3) ensuring there was a crowd of people at the booth engaged in an activity distinctly different from what was going on in other booths and thus creating a level of interest to attract the curious.  The crowds of people sitting around tables playing games was like having a carnival barker shouting out "come one come all and see something you've never seen before".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "problem" arose when the 30-45 minute demos began creeping to 60-90minute demos, and in a couple of cases...pretty much complete games were being played.  That monopolized table space, reduced traffic volume, and led to a lower sales per unit of effort rate.  That's what spawned the desire to require demos to be kept to a time limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 15 minute time limit was one of those brainstorm ideas that became a meme that became enshrined as booth policy.  I believe it came about at the same time as promoting the Elevator Pitch and occupied that same brainspace of short, punchy, to the point, attention grabbing and then move on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230895/#Comment_230895" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T13:43:25+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  1:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>I was happy to, but there was always this niggling feeling in the back of my head that selling my game to people who had already bought it was not the best use of my energy.</blockquote>\nAs one of those people, here's a thing to consider: demo is a quick building of a rapport.
