The thread collecting links for all of these posts is <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2866" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The reason for this is fairly straightforward: while not everyone agrees with this assessment, it is my belief that most RPG rulebooks are essentially teaching texts and/or workbooks or unconsciously modeled after them. In short, an RPG rulebook's essential task is to teach the game to the person reading it.<br/><br/>As such, being aware of some of the rules of instruction and learning can help you deliver your game into the minds of the players as clearly and painlessly as possible.<br/><br/>This post concerns itself with how to deal with human Attention Span and making efficient use of the time you have with the players.  In these, I'll attempt to come up with examples from various games that provide a good example of one of the guidelines, but I welcome questions about applicability and such in the comments.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attention Span</span></b><br/><br/><b>1.</b> Strive for variety in methods and media as much as possible.  (This isn't always possible, though it becomes moreso with Web Sites, Wikis, Flash animations, and so forth. To quote T. Roosevelt, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.\xe2\u20ac\x9d)  <br/><br/>One of the best examples of a novel teaching aid is the Capes Flash demo of the conflict mechanics.  For folks who don't have that kind of know-how, there are still Wikis to fill with demo information and example characters, downloadable 'cheat sheets' and and so forth, and other low-cost solutions to novel information delivery.<br/><br/><b>2.</b> Use visuals to provide impact and to speed learning. (See TROS\xe2\u20ac\u2122s <i>The Flower of Battle</i>)<br/><br/><b>3.</b> Present no more than 7 items of information before the players get to <i>do something</i>.  (In this, I'm reminded of Conspiracy of Shadows' rules for Cell Creation, which keep players engaged and tossing out ideas for the cell throughout the process.)<br/><br/><b>4.</b> Devote 2/3rds of your text to application and 1/3rd or less to presentation.  (For the purposes of unaccompanied gaming texts, we have to rely on Examples in the text and on Actual Play as our two main means of providing "application" within the text. Gameplay might not immediately happen, so Examples are very important.)<br/><br/><b>5.</b> People best remember things covered in the beginning and end of a section rather than those covered in the middle.  Cover key items early; review them again at the end.  (I think that the chapter layout for Mortal Coil was very well conceived: the bullet-list summary of the rules covered in each chapter provides a good review as well as a good, easy-to-find <i>reference</i> during play.)<br/><br/><b>6.</b> <b>Use plenty of examples, samples, analogies, metaphors, and similes \xe2\u20ac\u201c anything that helps the player understand the material.</b> <br/>(This really can't be emphasized enough.  I have yet to read a game text and think "this author uses too many examples."  I'm sure there's a point where that might happen, but I'm willing to bet that most games are <i>nowhere near</i> that point.  In the realm of instruction, <i>application</i> of the learning is the best possible way to teach.  We are not able to actually teach a class with an RPG book, and cannot guarantee that a gaming group will all sit down together like a round-table class with an expert on the system to teach it and time to go through every Task in the rules until they understand it, so in order to provide a sense of application, we need to provide <span style="text-decoration: underline;">examples</span> that show the rule being applied in a relevant way.  That allows their mind to 'apply' the learning.  However, since that's really only a fair substitute to the real thing, we need to give them those examples a LOT.)<br/><br/><b>7.</b> Always seek opportunities for the players to respond to each other and be active in the group.<br/>(Group character building (as encouraged in many Indie games -- I'll randomly point at Shadow of Yesterday) or group Setting building (Primetime Adventures) don't just create a Situation that everyone has a hand in -- it's also a group learning activiity in which everyone sitting at the table helps each other learn the rules.)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Efficient use of Time</span></b><br/><br/><b><i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153In some situations, the tedium is only relieved by the boredom.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i></b><br/><br/><b>1.</b> In your text, spend the most time on tasks and sub-tasks that are important and difficult to learn (just think about your game for a second -- you'll know what those things are -- usually it's conflict resolution or advice on setting good goals in a conflict). Devote less time to tasks that are less important, not as difficult to learn, and/or can be easily handled by referencing the text and/or asking the group (such as character generation).<br/><br/><b>2.</b> Reduce the time spent in the text on one-way delivery of information.  (For example: In a GMs section on session-prep, give the GM something to do besides read advice.  I point to Dogs in the Vineyard's Town Creation as a good example of Giving the Player Something to Do.)<br/><br/><b>3.</b> Use very clear language in explaining rules and tasks.  (Not sure if your text is clear?  Check out <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2869" rel="nofollow">The Fog Index</a>)<br/><br/><b>4.</b> Develop hand outs that reduce the need to refer to the text or to the \xe2\u20ac\u0153resident expert.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Usually referred to as Cheat Sheets, these can be invaluable to both teaching the game and speeding up play.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>As with any of these posts, questions and brainstorming are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">welcome</span> encouraged.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65103/#Comment_65103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T15:26:59+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  3:26PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
