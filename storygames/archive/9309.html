It's a little flat as presented though. I'd like the players at the table to have Agendas (connected to the system and fiction of the game somehow) that would inform their outcome decisions. Also, like you said, some sort of ability to manipulate to a degree the result of who is the outcome decider.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does one measure degrees of randomness? I'm pretty much happy as long as the randomness produces results that don't obviously violate the integrity of the fiction. That seems to usually be in the hands of whoever is narrating that particular bit of fiction though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm mainly in the "because I don't want to know for sure what is going to happen next" camp as well as the "it's quick and efficient" camp when it comes to my opinions on why the random generators. Also I think that it often brings a sense of objectiveness to outcomes. Not necessarily actual objectiveness, just the feeling. Unfortunately, I know I've been in my share of games where I basically would not have trusted some or all of the participants to make decisions in place of the random element being employed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206413/#Comment_206413" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T18:33:17+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  6:33PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your "you decide" system in an inherently geeky way, but these things shouldn't exist in a vacuum, right?

Having other people narrate the outcome (rather than making it one particular person's job) has been a huge flop in our gaming group in the past, because about half of the group really and truly does not want that job, or they want it only under specific circumstances and not thrust upon them by someone else.  I'd say that about 80% of the time I don't want it, either, and I can run a game where deciding outcomes is my job to satisfy that other 20%.  I quail at the thought of forcing the outcome-deciding job on someone who doesn't want it, or the potential overhead of having to track what other people decided in earlier scenes and why.  It just sounds ugly and not fun at all for the kind of gaming I like to do these days with my friends.<br/><br/>But I would say that this method does sound fun for a group of people who all really like deciding outcomes, or who like deciding outcomes as long as they don't have to do it all the time (like, say, people who GM games, or people who would like GMing games if they didn't have to do so much GM stuff in them).  There's nothing inherently bad about the idea, it's just not for everyone.  I don't mind not being in the target demographic for this.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206424/#Comment_206424" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T20:26:33+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  8:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could dig it if it was actually up to the person however many to my left, or I could dig it if the outcome was precontained in the rules.

But I don't find it innately satisfying.<br/><br/>Randomness in resolution feels icky to me right now.  Suppose you are playing by GM fiat, as in the GM does whatever they feel like.  Except, instead of letting a real player be the GM, you define an imaginary player be the GM.  The random scores are just an expression of the imaginary GM's arbitrary decisions.  I don't see how that improves things.  No longer is at least one player is being optimally satisfied at any given time.<br/><br/>The method you described is better because it minimizes how much is actually resolved by randomness.  Ultimately, a real player chooses the resolution.  However, rather than randomizing which player gets fiat, it would probably be more fun to take turns between rounds picking the turn order within rounds.  So even though a game played as you described might be fun, I don't think the randomness itself is contributing anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206442/#Comment_206442" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T23:11:34+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 11:11PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, games are all about some kind of magic that happens when people sit down to play. It's about an outcome that is more than the sum of the parts; unpredictable, yet tied to how I play, and satisfying. The magic comes in a lot of different ways, many of which make use of randomization. <br/><br/>Randomization can add the element of unpredictability. Like in games with a critical hit or fumble system, there's always that chance of the very unexpected. It can mix up the possible outcomes so that I can't hold them all in my head: like drawing from the Oracle deck in IaWA and getting an exciting combination of elements. Or it can smooth things out statistically over time, like my chance of hitting monsters in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>So to give my answer to your questions: we have randomizers because they are an extremely useful tool. The degree of randomization is of no importance at all, except that it be an appropriate degree to the game you\u2019re playing. That mechanic would work just fine for some things and not for others.<br/><br/>One side effect of randomization, is that it can create the feeling that the outcomes are "just random" and that how I play doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s perfectly appropriate in some games. The mechanic you mention has that element of randomness. I think it would be appropriate for something that's supposed to be outside my control, like an agent of chaos. Or it might suffice in a situation where you need an outcome decided, but how it\u2019s decided isn\u2019t that important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206445/#Comment_206445" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T00:33:00+00:00" title="May  9, 2009 12:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>[Randomization] can mix up the possible outcomes so that I can't hold them all in my head: like drawing from the Oracle deck in IaWA and getting an exciting combination of elements.

It's buried at the Forge somewhere. <br/><br/>Basically, imagine you're throwing a ball back and forth with someone. Throw, bounce, catch. It wouldn't be fun if the ball came into your hands, in the same way, every time. There needs to be variation: either because the other guy throws it differently or because it bounces slightly randomly.<br/><br/>So there needs to be some unpredictability. Often, that's down to randomness, like rolling a die. In a game like Polaris, it's down to unpredictability on the part of what the other player will say. That's good too.<br/><br/>I quite like your resolution system but I'm wary of resolution systems that aren't grounded in a game.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206769/#Comment_206769" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T16:22:17+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  4:22PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for giving me some really fun thoughts on these topics. There are obviously a lot of perspectives, and I was interested in hearing them. The vast majority of RPGs have some random element, and I have to say I'm always a little sad when I read something without randomness in some form, but maybe I just haven't read the right things. Polaris may make my reading list.<br/><br/>The resolution system was meant to be more of a conversation starter, I'm not actually sure I'd like it in play. That said, I think some of the comments convinced me that it might have merit, oddly enough. I think I reacted kind of like Roger: now way... wait, maybe.<br/><br/>Accounting, you said something that I found interesting, that randomness was a way to foist off the responsibility of making decisions and enjoy certain things more. Just out of curiosity, what things does your group enjoy more? I'm presuming that there are some things that you like making decisions for? What areas do you NOT want to be random?

It may have been implied by "Sometimes I want to maximize randomness because I want to see where it takes things"?  At that point, I'm really just speaking for myself and not assigning any particular credit/blame for that feeling to the rest of the people I play with: it's just a sense that sometimes I want to go with something that doesn't come exclusively from inside my own head (or someone else's), something that I can't predict, something that I'm not already prepared for.  I get some fun from scrambling to make sense of an unexpected result, sometimes.  Not all the time, not in every game, not even in every scene of a particular game, but...sometimes, y'know?  When that's what I'm in the mood for.<br/><br/><br/>If I'm going to be making guesses about my gaming group, I'd say that there are a couple of people who really and truly dislike randomness, for a mixture of reasons.  One's pretty well convinced from habitually poor dice karma (and possibly from her life experience) that all random chance leads inevitably to failure, and doesn't enjoy failure so much that she wants to play it out THAT often; once in a while, yes, but not constantly.  Another just gets twitchy when she can't predict and prepare for what's coming next, and gets stressed out when she really wants a particular outcome but can't be absolutely certain she'll get it.  Given a choice, I'd expect them to trend towards games with less randomization.<br/><br/>But we've got a devoted improv guy, too, and he just adores randomness in any form.  And we've got a couple of players who, like me, wander back and forth across the line of liking or disliking randomness depending on our moods and the situation.  As a result, we're fairly ambivalent about randomness as a group -- some of our game sessions have more, some have less.  People who are randomness-averse tend to build characters that will let them avoid randomness in certain areas (high attack bonuses so that they only miss on a natural 1, for example), and it all works out more or less okay in the end.<br/><br/><br/>What I did comment on earlier was that my gaming group doesn't work with shared narration and narration-passing mechanics, and a game which shared or passed around the responsibility of deciding the outcome of tasks would also fall in the "this won't work for us" category.<br/><br/>We've got a couple of people who do not want to GM a game, period, not even for a scene, not even for part of a scene -- it is not a fun activity for them.  We've got a couple others who don't mind running a game or taking on tasks that are usually up to a GM every once in a while, but don't like a steady diet of it and/or don't want it dumped on their laps when they don't feel like doing it.  And then we've got a couple of people who just love GMing, love doing all those tasks, and will be happy doing them whenever they can...and will yearn to do them when they can't, in some cases.<br/><br/>If deciding the outcome of a task is left up to the people who love doing it, no one has a problem.  If the people who like doing that stuff get to do it once in a while when the mood strikes them (or get to make all the decisions for one game out of every ten or so that we play), that works out pretty good, too.  But if the job is handed to the people who do not want it, then it's a failure for everyone.  All the energy and fun that we usually have in a gaming session vanishes, and no one wants that.  We get four or five hours on Saturday to hang out and enjoy each others' company and have fun playing a game, and there are plenty of systems that let us do exactly that...so when we tried narration passing and other GMless/GMful systems and they flopped, it was no big loss.  We shrugged, said "Okay, we won't do that again," and went on to have fun with systems that worked for us.<br/>\n<blockquote>Just out of curiosity, what things does your group enjoy more? I'm presuming that there are some things that you like making decisions for? What areas do you NOT want to be random? (I know, I know these are all matters of taste, but it sounds interesting)</blockquote>\nI'm not entirely sure how to answer those questions.  Some of them might be addressed vaguely above, in some form.  <br/><br/>Oh, here's something:  we all like making decisions during character creation: there's a lot of collaboration and crosstalk and discussion that goes into that, and everyone's involved in working out what kinds of characters will be around and how they can be tied together and stuff like that.  And people like making decisions for their characters in the sense of what they're going to attempt to do, naturally.  It's really only when you hit the "and here's what actually happens" point that we see the strong preference for having one person in charge of that, a person who WANTS that job.  Whether that's a GM, or a player who says "hey, let me handle this one" doesn't matter: it's really only when there's the threat of that responsibility landing on someone who doesn't want it that things begin to break down.  We're all friends and our weekly game is as much a social occasion as it is anything else: making one or more of us miserable isn't acceptable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206844/#Comment_206844" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T23:54:44+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 11:54PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice idea, Sage.

I posed the questions badly, but you gave me some great insight.<br/><br/>I think that the moment of "here's what happens" probably is a turning point for a lot of people, a point where they want to stop making statements and let someone (or something) else decide. In my general experience most players are happy to state, in intricate detail with heavy embellishment, what has happened to their characters prior to play. They'll provide a novel of backstory, but are more satisfied if play is decided by dice. To some degree, I'm one of those people, which kind of confuses me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206954/#Comment_206954" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T14:36:28+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  2:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To the first question in the OP, I think randomizers come from our assumptions about the universe: that it runs according to impersonal forces and physical laws, and that statistical probability can accurately model the interactions of those forces. I ran into this head-first with my game, <em>The Fifth World</em>, about feral humans living four hundred years after the end of civilization. While we accept this as a "true" understanding of how the universe works, and it works very well so long as you have a certain level of soil fertility, and Holocene-esque climate conditions allowing for widespread agriculture, the earth has rarely afforded such circumstances, and humans have rarely seen the world like this. In my case, with a world where those factors have stopped, people have adapted by becoming feral, including animists. This actually has little to do with religion; as writers like David Abram, Graham Harvey and Tim Ingold have explained at great length, it has more to do with extending the notion of "personhood" beyond just humans, to what Hallowell called "other-than-human persons." As you might imagine, this becomes quite advantageous if you have to hunt with a traditional bow, or even garden using the techniques of horticulture (see also, permaculture). Anyway, an early version of the game used dice, but I quickly saw this as immensely condescending. Here, I played a game trying to play feral animists who see the world defined in terms of relationship, with every event determined by the interaction of independent persons. And to determine those events, I rolled dice, effectively patting those characters on the head, thanking them for their quaint little view, and then proceeding with the adults in the room with what we all <em>really</em> know is going on. That really bothered me, so I spent a long time working out a mechanic that held true to an animist understanding of how the universe works, and wound up with something related to the Prisoner's Dilemma.<br/><br/>Anyway, I apologize if that explanation looped off into Tangent-ville, but I think it illustrates my main point, that we use randomizers in games in order to model how we understand the universe to work. So, depending on the kind of game you want to design, you might want to pay careful attention to the kind of randomizer you use (if any), because it will say something about your game and your fiction, and if you don't pay attention, it might say something you don't want it to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206977/#Comment_206977" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T16:54:04+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  4:54PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I can see how using a random result could be condescending, but what if I have significant control over that roll? Especially if I have some resource that I can burn to adjust the roll (so if I fail a roll that I really wanted to succeed on, I spend enough Awesome points to bump it up). <br/><br/>The difference I see is that in the dice example, my changing the result is guaranteed, but comes at some cost (loss of points or whatever bas stuff the rules give me). In the Prisoner's Dilemma situation, I can try to change the result at no cost (by my choice of strategy) but it's not guaranteed (the other player's choice has a strong effect on the value of mine). Granted, I'm presuming a lot about your system, is this a fair summary? <br/><br/>Is the perceived value in that the randomness comes from another person? I guess this was kind of what I was getting at with the sample I gave in the OP: does having the result come from another player have a higher value than coming from dice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206984/#Comment_206984" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T17:45:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  5:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we want uncertainty, then we don't necessarily need randomness. Uncertainty can come from many different sources. With different people, as in the Prisoner's Dilemma, you get uncertainty from incomplete information that gets revealed through play. Everybody has a piece of the puzzle, but no one of us can see what it all amounts to until we actually play. In fact, it doesn't amount to anything until we play.<br/><br/>Certainly, randomizers provide a well-tested, much-used means of introducing randomness. But I wouldn't say that they provide the best solution in every case. For my game, I don't think it fits. Yes, you can have points that give you the chance to "make up" for randomness. If you have enough points to cover even the worst roll, then you have a system where it becomes more a test of how badly you want it, and the game focuses on your ability to budget those points. That can make a very interesting game, and one I actually did experiment with for a while. But it didn't fit my game very well; it still had that same condescending attitude, since you still had randomness creating the baseline. It followed that up with a sentiment of striving and achievement able to overcome randomness, but my game dealt with people who saw the world as a matter of relationships. <a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2008/03/game-of-trust.html" rel="nofollow">The Prisoner's Dilemma really reinforces the themes my game focuses on</a>, and introduces uncertainty not from a die (which an animist would consider just a particularly fickle person), but from the way individuals relate to one another.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd say that a result coming from another player at the table has a greater value than a result coming from the dice, but I do think it helped my game specifically. I don't know if I'd feel comfortable pronouncing any hard-and-fast rules about the means we introduce uncertainty into games, except to say that each one comes with its benefits, its drawbacks, and its statements about the nature of the world, so you should take care to pick the one most consistent with what your game sets out to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
