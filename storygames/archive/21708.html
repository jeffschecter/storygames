Stuff like "well you don't have to play Fighter, you could choose a better class." We need to dig deeper for games where the inequality is not a matter of choice or accident, but rather unavoidable (and intentional?) design. That's much more difficult to find, surely.<br/><br/><i>Fables of Camelot</i> has that quality, the PCs are explicitly ranked at the beginning of the game in an unfair (though mild) way. There's no trade-off involved, to be of poor social status is to be of poor social status (and there's no reward for it). It's not a major element, though, but rather just a minor drama seed.<br/><br/>The <i>Dragonlance</i> campaign starts the players with noticeably inequal dramatic roles: some are chosen to be the messengers who usher in the new age of divinity on Krynn, while others are chosen to be the funny ethnic sidekick.<br/><br/>Anybody remember how <i>Poison'd</i> determines the initial ship hierarchy? I seem to remember that there's some logic for determining who gets to be first mate (or if it's a NPC), but I don't remember how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474950/#Comment_474950" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-20T06:23:13+00:00" title="June 20, 2018  6:23AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3:16 the ranks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474953/#Comment_474953" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-20T08:00:48+00:00" title="June 20, 2018  8:00AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hurlements  (initiates and novices), Wield, Bloodlust (weapons and wielders).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474962/#Comment_474962" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-20T15:19:27+00:00" title="June 20, 2018  3:19PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar enough with modern systems to give you a breakdown, but the concept has been going for a while.<br/><br/>Back in the day there was the <i>Hero System</i> campaign 'Greek Hero'.

If you have a group of power-players then you are unlikely to have happy players if one is elevated above them.<br/><br/>In the Hero System I mentioned, the 'king' player(s) started on more points than the followers. In Bushido, Elric and Chivalry and Sorcery the game granted higher status characters additional starting money and equipment as well as a better range of combat-related skill bonuses.<br/><br/>It can work, but you need the players to be on board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474972/#Comment_474972" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-20T19:03:49+00:00" title="June 20, 2018  7:03PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2018 7:15PM by DeReel.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Hurlements, initiates have a major numerical (like X2 on % stats, plus fantastic powers) and an overwhelming fictional edge.
