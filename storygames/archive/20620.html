Some games are clearly coming from one tradition of design versus another.<br/><br/>However, there is so much conflated in those terms that sometimes they can be harmful to communication.<br/><br/>I agree with your call to keep such a semantic arguments out of otherwise fruitful discussions - they only clutter everything unnecessarily.<br/><br/>I would add:<br/><br/>1. When you use those terms, try to be as clear as possible as to what you mean. And, often, more specific terms (e.g. "focused scenario games" vs. "sandbox games", or "new games" versus "old game texts") will work better, so don't be lazy and resort to "indie" and "trad" unless you've already made clear what you mean.<br/><br/>2. When you read a thread, try to understand why the author is using the terms she is using, and read charitably. You're not going to help by picking nits and arguing that Pathfinder is "independent, from a certain point of view" when the conversation is about including character beliefs in a GM's adventure planning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452399/#Comment_452399" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T19:09:02+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:09PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is true that constantly correcting other people's terminology is not the most productive way to spend anybody's time.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a clarity of communication is a nice thing to have as well.<br/><br/>When it comes to these specific words (there are many other terminological debates one could have, too), the debate is probably fueled by the in-group vs. out-group usage differences; as both groups are essentially stable socially (even if for different reasons) and usage is uniform within them, neither really makes any inroads in convincing the other to change the way they use words.<br/><br/>To be specific, here's what I'm seeing regarding "indie":<br/><br/><b>In-Group:</b> The small, internally well-connected clique of indie gaming activists, many of whom started e.g. a decade ago, consistently use the term "indie" in the Forgite way, the way Ron originally defined it when he started promoting it. These people often have some history of publishing themselves, and often have convictions about the artist-publisher relationship; therefore "indie" not being some sort of a marketing label for drama games matters to them, and using the term their way is effortless and useful. The other usage is exclusionary and entirely unacceptable when you're trying to e.g. organize a joint convention appearance with other indie designers, as you usually do not want to start excluding people because their games don't use conflict resolution systems, or whatever.<br/><br/><b>Out-Group:</b> People who have experienced the indie phenomenon from the "outside" started early on to use the term to basically indicate "the kind of new style experimental dramatic games they make at the Forge". After the diaspora new emphasises have developed with e.g. the Nordic freeform influences and such, resulting in "indie" basically meaning "a roleplaying game different from the usual assumptions". There are many more of the people who use the term this way than there are members of the in-group, and newcomers naturally join this group first as they adopt language; some may move on to adopt the in-group terminology for whatever reason later on, but a constant presence of people using the term this way is practically guaranteed.<br/><br/><b>Other words:</b> Both the in-group and the out-group use "traditional" in roughly the same way. "Narrativist" and "story game" are examples of words that have also had currency at different points to gesture towards the out-group meaning of indie as "this new experimental way, different from trad". However, it seems that "indie" is more popular, probably because it suits better as an umbrella term for a cultural trend, not having any analytical content for nit-picking to latch on. I've tried to suggest "progressive" as an alternative, as that word's not in use elsewhere, and it's also traditional in other fields, but of course that sort of well-meaning terminological invention never gets anywhere.<br/><br/><b>Jason:</b> Jason Corley there represents a special fringe position in this terminology, so it's probably a good idea to note it separately: as far as I know (not trying to put words into his mouth), Jason agrees with the afore-defined in-group on "indie" (that is, it just means that the game is creator-owned), but disagrees with <i>both</i> the in- and out-groups on "traditional", claiming that such a phenomenon does not exist historically, and should therefore not be discussed. It's an entirely honorable position in terms of cultural studies, but as Jason pushes it so eagerly, he probably causes as much debate over this terminological issue here at SG as the other two camps do.<br/><br/>There probably isn't any sensible way to eliminate either usage of "indie" to a point where people would feel unjustified in continuing with it; as things stand, both ways of using the term are apparently considered entirely legitimate by the people who use the word that way. Certainly both usages are needed: we need a way to say "this game is creator-owned", and we need a way to say "this game takes radical freedoms from the way rpgs are traditionally designed".<br/><br/>It seems to me that unless you're specifically teaching people, it is useless to make this a sticking-point, it's just derailing discussion; just use some other words if you're worried about being understood, or explain yourself each time. I suppose that the ideal situation would be one where people had a rich vocabulary of words to indicate what they mean, and I generally like to be precise myself, but apparently the scene in general is happy enough with the way things are. I don't even want to seriously suggest introducing new words, as that'd also mean new ways to misuse them <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452401/#Comment_452401" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T19:21:13+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:21PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I guess I'll also give the way I use these words myself:<br/><br/>As far as <b>indie</b> goes, I'm happy with the Forgite definition, focusing strictly on practical publishing arrangements of the product. I've never used the word to describe content, except maybe in a second-hand way, by e.g. remarking upon how much more common it is for an indie game to be experimental than it is for a corporate game.<br/><br/>OK, so that wasn't a surprise - same definition as Potemkin there. For <b>traditional</b>, however, I differ clearly, because what he's defining is simply <i>corporate ownership</i>, which while interesting in itself, is not what I usually mean when I say "trad". Rather, for me the concept of "traditional rpg design" is an important tool in examining the cultural history of roleplaying, and consequently the term finds much usage in that context: a trad game is one that partakes in the game design and production culture of the short-lived 1980s rpg industry. Many, many games were published through-out the decade, and the culture continued to limp along until the late '90s, forming the basis of what we think of as the normal baseline of rpg product today. As a cultural study term I find "trad" extremely valuable, as it is a concise shorthand to indicate a game that shares values, design ideas and cultural context with this historical rpg design "school".<br/><br/>As I mentioned shortly above, the counter-parts that I use for these words are <b>corporate</b> (or "mainstream") for games that aren't indie, and <b>progressive</b> (or "experimental") for games that aren't traditional.<br/><br/>As one might imagine, I don't feel much need to debate these definitions. Just thought it interesting to note that while "indie" is the word people mostly seem to disagree on, we can certainly manage to differ on "trad" as well.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452404/#Comment_452404" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T19:56:36+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the early 1980s, we had Advanced D&amp;D, Basic D&amp;D, and Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Every game descended from Basic is <b>old school</b>.<br/><br/>Every game descended from Advanced or from Basic Roleplay (CoC's system) is <b>trad</b>.<br/><br/>Every game not descended from any of these is <b>indie</b>.<br/><br/>"Old school" and "trad" are often farther apart than "trad" and "indie".<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Dirk">@Dirk</a>, I agree that these terms <i>can</i> be used as useful shorthand where every reader sufficiently gets the gist.

This is the traditional style of almost all RPGs prior to the Forge (but not strictly all). <br/><br/>So the essence of the traditional style is that it is "<b>GM-controlled</b>" or "<b>GM-supervised</b>" even if at the same time the players might, in substance, be leading the development of the plot (as they do, in most games of the sort I prefer).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452454/#Comment_452454" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-21T07:32:50+00:00" title="April 21, 2016  7:32AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I think that just about wraps up this thread.

As we've seen, there are different definitions.<br/><br/>If you want a term that distinguishes between mid-school D&amp;D and other trad games of the period (a distinction that I rarely find important in comparison to e.g. the differences between early and later D&amp;D), what might be a common phrasing there? People used to talk about "dramatic" games at some point, and about "roll playing vs. role playing", and such. The distinction between D&amp;D and new wave games <i>was</i> important in e.g. the '80s scene. Whitewolf famously called their games "storytelling games" (or rather, Storyteller system, but anyway) specifically to distinguish from D&amp;D and other perceived low-brow games.<br/><br/>Interestingly we don't really have a high-profile word for being traditional yet not D&amp;D, despite this being an important and distinction for many gamers. The closest that people around here come is "not D&amp;D" or "normal roleplaying games" - D&amp;D is often not counted as "normal" here in Finland due to how different it is from the realism-immersion through-line of the later tradition. More normal than Forgite games, yes, but less normal than say Call of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452496/#Comment_452496" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T09:00:26+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  9:00AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The story of the culture around specific RPGs here in Europe seems to be quite different from the same as experienced in the USA.
