The game I'd like to play just right now, unfortunately, doesn't exist. At least, it doesn't exist <i>yet</i>.<br/><br/>I was really shocked to discover the elegance of the <i>Apocalypse World</i> engine in all of its iterations (mainly <i>Monsterhearts</i> and <i>Monster of the Week</i>). I liked a lot the premise of having something preplanned by the GM/organizer and at the same time very clever tools to create a vibrant fictional reality with predefined traits, action/reactions and so on.<br/><br/>I suppose I'm not the only one who noticed this. I can see an explosion of hacks of AW so It's clear this is considered a very fertile ground.<br/><br/>Now I'm wondering: is it possibile to translate this engine into a larp?<br/><br/>Probably what I'm aiming for is not a "freeform" larp, like the ones where you have syncronous events (like that while I'm having my conversation in a corner of the room, someone else is scheming outside the house). The problem would be that we couldn't be on the same page and share at the same time the same "mental space".<br/>Maybe I'd try something more on the jeepform tradition of having a space functioning like a stage, so that all the participants are sharing the same narrative and premises, and can build on each others' contributions by manipulating the same fictional magma, even if from outside the scene.<br/>Obviously, a very big difference between tabletop rpg and live action is that in larps, at least most of the ones I've played, it's nice if you have continuous flow of play; while it seems that in "powered by the Apocalypse" tabletop rpgs you are pausing a lot while you decide what move you'll try, what to do, what is happening, and so on - which is cool in those games but I suspect would break the flow of larp, or the theatrical unity of a jeepform scene.<br/><br/>Some time ago a tried a semi-larp version of this nice little gem of a rpg that is <i><a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/76320/gun-thief" rel="nofollow">Gun Thief</a></i> by McDaldno. At the end of each scene the protagonist had to choose something to left and - if I remember correctly - the antagonists had to choose the next scene among a very close set of possibilities. It worked very well.<br/>It could be that the game I'm trying to imagine is just like that: different roles in the story and decisions that the players should make <i>at the end of a scene</i>, so that the consensual and collective construction of meaningful narration happens <i>between and after</i> the scenes. Something similar already happens with <i>Fiasco</i>: someone chooses the starting situation and someone else tells you the outcome.<br/><br/>What do you think of this? Can you see the same game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404327/#Comment_404327" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T14:09:28+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  2:09PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2013 2:11PM by thadrine.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, now that you mention it.... <br/><br/>Years ago I ran a murder mystery party that had a simple conflict system that I created. Looking back at it reminds me a lot of AW. <br/>In in AW the scale has 3 outcomes 0-6, 7-9, 10+ and this translates well to the LARP system I created. <br/><br/>Characters have a few stats (whatever fits the genre) and 3 "Aspects" that go into a bit more detail about a character. <br/><br/>So for our Victorian Murder Mystery it was....(taken out of Houses of the Blooded to create a LARP, before John published the LARP rules)<br/><br/>Prowess 2<br/>Cunning 1<br/>Wisdom 1<br/>Beauty 2<br/>Status 1<br/>Wealth 2<br/>"Obnoxious twit"<br/>"Ruggedly handsome"<br/>"Never backs down"<br/><br/>If an Aspect applied they could add +1, the could also add Style points for +1. It was reduced by a GM modifier if uncontested, or the rank of any opposition. <br/>And we treated the results as....<br/>0 = No, and...<br/>1 = No...<br/>2 = Yes, but...<br/>3 = Yes...<br/>4 = Yes, and...<br/><br/>Everyone described their action, and we resolved each result separately. If there was a contest to see who went first, it went to whoever spent the most Style for it. If stress needed to be done it cost 1 style point per point of stress, with a max of half your value rounded down. So on a 3 you could spend 1 Style to do one 1 Stress, on a 4 you could Spend 2 for 2 points of stress. <br/><br/>People got Style awarded to them anytime they advanced the story, did something cool, or hindered themselves in some way by their Aspects. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404328/#Comment_404328" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T14:31:07+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  2:31PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you but definitely it's not what I'm looking for.

I'm looking for a randomizer-less framework with a similar structure of moves that "build sense" of the story rather than, say, translate "tokens" (eg. strength, wisdom, beauty).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405047/#Comment_405047" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T13:27:12+00:00" title="January 30, 2013  1:27PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good high level description by Levi.
