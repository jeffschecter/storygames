Please bear with me, when I try to describe this in my usual affirmative way ...<br/><br/>When we think of rpgs in general, we tend to think in terms of D&amp;D and other classical games. However; since year 2000 the picture is a bit more complex, with several influential design-traditions broadening the idea of what a role-playing game is and may do. Nothing less than a shift of paradigm has taken place within the design of role-playing games<br/><br/>I believe that the first 20 years of our design history was under the <b>classical paradigm</b> of rpgs; GM/player-divide, scenario and conflict-dynamics, and character-focus.<br/><br/>The last 10 years we have seen the paradigm shift. The <b>modern paradigm</b> frequently see these qualities in games: player-equality, thematic and dramatic-freedom, and focus on player-interaction. At the same time most of the modern games retain some level of character-focus, but the picture in this respect is way more fragmented than it used to be.<br/><br/>I do not believe that my description of the classical and modern paradigms are quite there yet, so please feel free to help me out here.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on the main idea;<br/>- do you believe <i>our design-paradigm has shifted?</i><br/>- If so; how has it shifted? Do you agree with me? Anything I've overlooked?<br/>- Where do you think the modern paradigm will bring us?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287768/#Comment_287768" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T04:48:39+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  4:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to sound negative, but I kinda thought this was commonly accepted by now - to the point where we already got over the fact that there was a paradigm shift, and moved on? People have long been talking about "trad vs. indie" or "classic vs. modern" or even silly stuff like "forge games vs. real roleplaying games". A lot of people are still struggling about how to define those things, but the bottom line is: they can't ignore the distinction, it's there, even if nebulous and probably far less shocking than some think.<br/><br/>I would concur that the design paradigm has shifted, design has matured, it now knows much better what it is about and what it wants to achieve. I would venture to say that it started with the Forge but it was in incubation long before that. I think the peak of that shift has come and gone, and the community has been settling down for the past few years.<br/><br/>At the same time, I don't think it has been *that* radical. It was just very tumultuous. A lot of the mechanics and techniques that "modern" games use, have been around pretty much since the beginning. Fundamentally, we're still doing the same things. It's just that we've learned to reflect them, systematize and formalise them and identify their bits and bolts. Things such as what constituted "good GMing" was just hearsay and experimentation back in the day, then it was written advice, now it's <i>systemic</i>. The greatest overhaul, I believe, was the fact that the community came to accept roleplaying games as <i>games</i>, without abandoning the roleplaying element (that terrible, terrible old fallacy of roll-play vs. role-play). The definition was broadened, became more inclusive, because of the (deceptively simple) realisation that the keystone of the hobby was <i>play</i>, as a social activity, and the design shifted from the abstract to social - we had to be reminded that it's about these people here at the table, interacting.<br/><br/>There are still parts of the internet that are kicking against that, but they've long degenerated into a self-parody of hate. <br/><br/>As for the future. No one really knows. And that's exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287885/#Comment_287885" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T12:59:17+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 12:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>I would concur that the design paradigm has shifted, design has matured, it now knows much better what it is about and what it wants to achieve.</blockquote>Good, so you are positive to my claim. Thanks!<br/><br/>I believe that we (the designers), under the new paradigm, are understanding rpgs in <i>different</i> ways. In some respects our understanding far outgun the designers before us, but in other respects we may have lost out on rpg-essentials. Designers working under the new paradigm don't seem to be very good at taking care of the character-focus good games of old made into magic (some modern designers argue that this "magic" is a bluff; illusionism, participationism, etc.). Some modern designers seems to be a bit fluffy too, when it comes to keeping the stories created in their games coherent (some "story-games" are bad tools for creating stories, actually).<br/><br/>Maybe some things needs to be rediscovered, to bring us further forward. Maybe it is time for <i>post-modernism</i> in rpg-design ...<br/><br/>Let me propose some slogans for post-modern designers:<br/><br/>- Let us boldly go into the old known!<br/><br/>- We must go back, to go forward!<br/><br/>- Magic must be ordinary!<br/><br/>- Humbleness is all, and all is left to discover!<br/><br/>- Human conditions will follow us into our games, and deliver us to the paradise of fiction!<br/><br/>Love!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287955/#Comment_287955" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T17:05:30+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  5:05PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am somewhat unconvinced that the modern paradigm forsakes a character focus.

Here's a summary.<br/><br/>I think you're missing the actually transition, Tomas.  It doesn't go OLD GAMES --&gt; NEW GAMES, right?  It goes more of a continuum that looks like:<br/><br/>1970s---------------1980s----------------1990s---------------2000s------------TODAY<br/><br/>And there's a lot of transitional stuff between original D&amp;D and, say, Apocalypse World.  Call of Cthulhu, White Wolfie stuff, Ars Magica, Over The Edge, etc.  Even breaking it up into decades is super-artificial, because it's not like games that came out in 2000 are different from the ones in 1999.  There were progressive standout games and retro games in all eras.<br/><br/>Also, haven't we already had the Olde Skool Revival?  It seems pretty strong.  I'm kinda expecting the next wave to be a rediscovery of late-1980s+early-1990s games and design/play styles.<br/><br/>Also, didn't this transition happen differently in different parts of the world?  Like, take the Nordic countries.  I remember from Eero that, in Finland at least, all the 1980s games kinda dropped at the same time, yeah?  There was a giant wave where they all got translated or appeared in Finland at the same time, rather than gradually over the course of a decade.  In some places, as in Asia, this current wave of player-equality and so forth doesn't seem to have happened yet and, in fact, is not guaranteed to happen at all, necessarily, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287994/#Comment_287994" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T23:24:41+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 11:24PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2010 11:29PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>it's not like games that came out in 2000 are different from the ones in 1999.</blockquote>No, of course not! LOL<br/><br/>I see no clear and groundbreaking divide between the different decades, Jonathan. My proposal of before and after the year 2000 is "false" too, as I believe we speak about a fleeting transition. I chose it to say something about how we could perceive rpgs from around that time, and how that has made our traditional idea of what rpgs are, become a little ... estranged from what they had actually grown into.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Pitre</cite><b>Classical</b>: Restricting options for action, such as providing a table for all of the possible outcomes for a critical hit.<br/><b>Modern</b>: Providing options for actions, such as providing guidelines on what kinds of outcomes on that critical hit.</blockquote>I do not get this.<br/><br/>It sounds as classical games are telling their players "you may not do this, and not that, and not those things". Classical games don't do such a thing. They do make you build your character within a fictional framework,which is a positive way of telling us all what this game is all about. And having tables (few games got them, actually) is a way of "providing guidelines on outcomes from a critical hit", in my view. <br/><br/>And when you say that modern games "provide options for actions", I don't really follow you; how do they? And do they really provide the "guidelines" you are talking about?<br/><br/>Your way of putting this, makes me wonder if you "read" old times and new with your <i>new</i> eyes, Jason, so you don't really see the qualities of old ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Pitre</cite><b>Classical</b>:  Focus on character actions and competency.<br/><b>Modern</b>: Focus on character decisions and agency.</blockquote>This reads a bit more in tune with reality that the above, in my view. But still; seems like you're missing out on something important here ...<br/><br/>I know classical games can have very shallow character-identification. Classical games is often played with no reverence to or development of character; it is only used as an excuse for relating to the "tactics of the table". Focus is not on "character action", but on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">action</span> alone. However; somehow classical games can be very strong in character-identification too, to the point where we talk about immersing in character, and making character inform any speech and action the player instigates. This is where the magic of classical games are found, in my view. It is why I find <i>Dogs in The Vineyard</i> to be such a great game, due to it being a classical game with these qualities so up in the day. <i>My Life with Master</i> is a classical game too, in my view, with these qualities ready for you.<br/><br/>Modern games I find to be good in different ways, but to be a bit lacking in the department of character-identification. <i>Prime Time Adventures</i> is one such game; the method of it totally convinces me with its drive; it is a great game - but I find it hard to really identify with my character in the game. In my experience it is harder to identify with character in modern games, maybe due to the fact that the interpretation of it is bound up in so much story-mechanics ... The character get lost in the story, kind of. We toy with our characters, but we don't really build the deep feelings for it, like we used to in the best of classical games.<br/><br/>Please bear with me. I am trying to grasp something ethereal here, or at least it feels like I am. I find it hard to grasp, but I believe it to be of some importance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287996/#Comment_287996" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T23:54:22+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 11:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Classical games don't *facilitate* character-identification in the way some of the best modern games do\u2014but in many local cultures of play, the mechanically-divorced *ability* to identify with one's character, talk in his/her voice, and make decisions based solely on his/her point of view is highly prized at the social level.  I would say this phenomenon is very true with my college gaming group, which makes for a local culture of play that has the following strengths:<br/><br/>-little turtling/conflict-avoidance (people are good at making characters who are motivated to interact with the game's situation / the other characters)<br/>-corollary to above, little tolerance for derailers, griefers, or cheaters of any sort<br/>-overall good acting skills among many gamers in the group<br/>-are so dedicated to playing their characters accurately that sometimes people are nicer to you / interact with you in character than in real life!  (Am thinking primarily of our theater LARPs here, but it happens in tabletops too)<br/><br/>And the following weaknesses:<br/><br/>-don't want there to be anything they perceive to be "rules for roleplaying," including things like social skills; mechanics should be a physics model only (essentially)<br/>-games often have poor pacing, or at least pacing has to be directly controlled by the GM<br/>-a reluctance to collaboratively world-build (GMs building elaborate worlds that they reveal in a piecemeal fashion is very big too, which may be separate from the in-character stuff I identified above)<br/>-(probably the worst) sometimes have trouble with the idea of discussing what they want out of the game in a frank and honest manner, or just typical falling back on "it's what my character would do" excuse for dickishness<br/><br/>Local cultures of play centered around modern designs will tend to have different sets of strengths and weaknesses, of course, but I thought it was worthwhile to examine this question of character-identification more closely.  As someone who came from my college gaming group's culture, as described above, into the S-G/modern design world, I find I usually have almost no trouble balancing both character-identification and more overall, game-level concerns like pacing or "what would be most interesting for everyone at the table."<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287998/#Comment_287998" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T00:38:35+00:00" title="August 21, 2010 12:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2010 12:39AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Classical games don't *facilitate* character-identification in the way some of the best modern games do</blockquote>Do modern games facilitate character-identification, or merely the <i>use of character</i>. In my experience the latter is closer to truth for most modern games.<br/><br/>I try to describe what I see as fundamental differences in classical and modern role-playing games.<br/><br/>Part of my motivation is to grasp how you make strong character-identification the driving force of the game, filling it with the magic of "being someone else", the way I have experienced it in some classical games. Yes; these qualities are often depending on the GM-techniques and the group-dynamics. So what? The GM is part of the game, and are supposed to develop some techniques to master it. Group dynamics will play a part whatever game you play. My question is: <i>How do you boil this soup into greatness?</i><br/><br/>:-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Megan" title="Megan"><img alt="Megan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Megan">Megan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288003/#Comment_288003" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T05:03:01+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  5:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm...<br/><br/>This sounds a bit like the introduction of object-oriented programming into the computer world. Some people hailed it as the all-new and far better way, and raved about the programming tools that were now available to facilitate it as opposed to old-style programming tools that didn't.<br/><br/>Then I stood up in a major conference on the subject and said, "Isn't it a state of mind?"<br/><br/>Thing was, many of the core principles - such as 'encapsulating' code segments into discrete chunks and 'reusing' them whenever appropriate (she says trying to grab some of the more intelligible concepts as I know you're not all computer geeks!) - were things that many programmers were doing quite well with old-style programming tools, because that was the way we thought about our code. Sure, the new tools might well make it easier to work that way, but they too came with their baggage and their quirks that didn't suit every programmer or every programming task.<br/><br/>In a way, I approach gaming in the same way. I've been at it since 1977 so started in very 'traditional' in your model. But from the outset, what I have enjoyed about the hobby is the 'alternate reality' of the game world, in which my and other people's characters exist and interact. And that's the way I have always played, and GMed and written. The game ruleset is just a framework, used primarily to describe the character mechanically and then for task resolution when necessary - mostly for things like combat or lock-picking, things where you set your skills and abilities against a specific challenge in which you may or may not succeed. The ruleset is always subordinate to the creation of the alternate reality, it just describes how it 'works'... somewhat like the laws of physics describe how the real world works. You don't need to understand gravity to know that your feet will generally stay on the floor. <br/><br/>With the advent of story games there is often a greater concentration on the 'interaction' part of the game which is what I particularly delight in. But sometimes the mechanics are more intrusive than those of a traditional RPG, more artificial... they make the interactions work well, but they don't run along behind the scenes.<br/><br/>So at least one of the reasons I'm here in this forum (apart from you are interesting and nice people to hang out with) is to pick out the best bits from the 'modern' or 'story' game to improve the way I can play the 'traditional' ones... because I delight in the detailed settings and long-term campaigns that stick with the same characters for years and years that seem to happen in 'traditional' games more often than the ones here, which are often one-shot by design. Trying to mesh the two... <br/><br/>(Better shut up now, think I'm wibbling a bit.

There is such a diversity of games that my experience with classical games may be quite different from yours.   Thus we might make quite different conclusions from our disparate data.<br/><br/><b>Classical Games</b>:  AD&amp;D, Gurps, Rolemaster<br/><b>Modern Games</b>: Dogs in the Vineyard, Don't Rest your Head, Fate.<br/><br/>In the classical games I have dealt with, the player decides on a general course of action and the details are randomly determined.  AD&amp;D 2nd ed unarmed combat or Rolemaster are excellent examples where you choose to "attack unarmed" and random chance turns your attack into a haymaker.   Because the player can not modify the details of their actions as well, they cannot flavour them with the personality and flavour of their character and thus the games tend to revert to a mechanistic tactical exercise. <br/><br/>In modern games, the conflict resolution often leads to situations of "you win, but" or "you loose, and".  The outcome is determined, but the details are entirely in the hands of the players.  Accordingly, the drunk might win a fight by a lucky wild swing of a chair and having great luck, while a kung-fu master might use precise aimed strikes to take down his opponent.   Usually the conflict resolution systems are more open and an argument and archeological puzzle are each using the same variety of resolution.<br/><br/>I think the issue is that you are lumping the the narrative control games, as being modern.   I see the emphasis on character development, agency and player creativity as the key aspects of "modern" games.  I view Dogs and My Life with Master as being beautiful examples of the modern design paradigm.  Prime Time Adventures also falls into that category, but I don't think it _defines_ the category.<br/><br/><br/>Your mileage may vary though. This all comes down to personal interpretation of the terms and I think we are coming at this from different directions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288026/#Comment_288026" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T10:19:26+00:00" title="August 21, 2010 10:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding terms, I really dislike using the term "modern" to label a particular style.  Like the decades-old "modernist" artistic movements, it is bound to be a misnomer.  Even now, it seems to me that most RPGs released at present (i.e. D&amp;D4, Doctor Who, etc.) are still closer to the classical mold than the features presented.  It makes more sense to me to present this as a split for a particular purpose of dialogue, rather than trying to classify all games into this two-way split.  <br/><br/>Megan: That makes sense to me, even though I'm not sure what wibbling is.  I also still play a fair amount of classical/traditional games including long-term campaigns, although I also play a number of one-shot or short campaigns of story games.  It sounds similar to Tomas' "How do you boil this soup into greatness?"  <br/><br/>One thing is that greatness is very relative.  That is, what is great for one person is not so hot for another.  For example, in the thread on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12764&amp;page=1#Item_30" rel="nofollow"><b>"GMs who are frustrated by Trad players"</b></a>, cwilbur suggested for aggressive scene framing and going straight for the conflict for traditional games.

There are a whole lot of techniques that got widespread attention about the same time, such as encapsulation, which are necessary for the object-oriented viewpoint to be successful but which aren't, strictly speaking, object orientation.  The difference is that object orientation explicitly calls out and requires encapsulation; good programmers had figured it out and were doing it beforehand.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, if you take that paragraph, and replace "object orientation" with "story games" and "encapsulation" with "character agency," you get something that I think is also true.  Both movements looked at what was being done well in their predecessors and codified it.  A good trad GM encourages a lot of character agency despite what the system does; a good old-school programmer encourages a lot of encapsulation and reuse despite what the methodology calls for.<br/><br/>jhkim: I don't think that tight scene framing and cutting right to the conflict are necessarily universally good, and I think a lot depends on how aggressively the scenes are framed and how hard you drive for the conflict.  But I've sat through too many trad games where we played out the minutiae of things like travel, wishing for any scene framing at all, wishing that the GM would realize that we're neither illuminating characters and setting nor progressing towards a conflict, realizing that this four-hour session is going to have 10 minutes of awesome and 3 hours and 50 minutes of filler.  I no longer have any interest in games where I am expected to account for every last copper piece, and I no longer have any interest in games where I have to be bored because my character is doing something dull and repetitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288036/#Comment_288036" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T11:46:02+00:00" title="August 21, 2010 11:46AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charlton - <br/><br/>Agreed.

For example, we just had a thread <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12780&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>"1001 Nights hack for Mouse Guard"</b></a> where a group adapted the 1001 Nights rules to their story.  Small press publications have been common in traditional RPGs, but are even moreso in story games.  <br><br>The distinction, then, is that the story games community more strongly prefers to have adjustments be made into formal hacks or variants - whereas traditional role-players often (though not always) prefer on-the-fly adjustments to the rules.  <br><br>While this is an important difference in tendency, I wouldn't call it central.  That is, if someone plays Castles &amp; Crusades exactly by the book using the rules as written, I don't think it would be recognized as a story game - and conversely I don't think that the 1001 Nights Mouse Guard hack would generally be called a traditional RPG.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288046/#Comment_288046" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T13:18:40+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  1:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jhkim: Oh, sure, there are other solutions to the problem.  I just want trad gamers to be aware that it can be a problem, and to be aware of at least one solution to the problem.<br/><br/>TylerT: I don't buy your taxonomy at all, in part because it leads me to the conclusion that GURPS is a story game and that In A Wicked Age is a trad game.  I mean, the usual style of play in GURPS is to represent everything within the rules -- which are clear, if complex, game play oriented choices -- and then to explain them within the fiction.  And with In A Wicked Age it's often the case where the story runs into a situation where the rules don't fit very well and the fiction winds up being the result of on-the-fly game design.<br/><br/>My view on what makes a game a story game is that the rules focus significantly on things that matter to <i>stories,</i> and to a lesser extent on other creative agendas.  GURPS is not a story game because the principal focus of the rules is modelling the characters and how they interact with the world; there is no mechanical support at all for making a skill check more difficult because it really matters to the character or to the players, aside from GM fiat.  In A Wicked Age is a story game because stories are what it does -- the dice mechanic is really just a tool for determining who has narrative authority to say what happens, and no thought is given to tactical puzzles for the players to solve or accurately modelling anything about the world. <br/><br/>And here's a question, because I thought of using it as an example and decided it was unclear and thus interesting:  is Apocalypse World a "classical" or "modern" game, a "trad" game or a "story" game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288049/#Comment_288049" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T13:26:38+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  1:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2010 1:27PM by TylerT.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jhkim">@jhkim</a><br/>\nWell sure, home rules and variants exist even in board games, it's just most board games don't require that level of skill to enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nit's very likely that someone who's played with the traditional flow would want to mod almost any sort of game.<br/>\n<br/>\nit's still entirely possible to make a game that does not work regardless of whether the game inspires the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story game flow is what simply allows a formal game to exist. otherwise the game must be constructed by the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288052/#Comment_288052" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T13:39:49+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  1:39PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">@cwilbur</a><br/>\n<br/>\nit's cool we can disagree, but i'm not sure we are just yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me a game of gurps is nothing but a story inspiring rules, it's trying very hard to be explicitly that.

Trying to mesh the two...<br><br>(Better shut up now, think I'm wibbling a bit. Do I make any sense?)</br></br></blockquote>\nYou make the most sense of everyone, I think.<br><br>But then, I'm already inclined to agree with you.  I don't feel like I can get anything out of making up pigeonholes to file games into, and I don't care to identify myself as anything other than someone who likes playing RPGs, so all this "trad game" versus "story game" paradigm-shift wibbling (what a lovely word!) wouldn't appeal to me even if I thought there was some valid basis for dividing gaming up into two categories.  It's a big, sprawling hobby with lots of different games and ideas in it, and I'm happy to take anything and everything that looks good and go use it wherever I think it'll make things more fun.<br><br><br>I'm guessing that maybe this whole concept just appeals more to game designers than it does to anyone else.  You know, the same way painters or musicians might find it useful to identify with a particular style, both to identify themselves to audiences and to narrow the focus of their influences down to a more manageable level.  ("I'm an impressionist, I've studied the techniques of all the great impressionist painters -- if you like impressionism, you should check out my work."  "We play country music, we love Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings and all the old greats, so c'mon and listen to us, country music fans!")<br><br>Which I guess is okay, but if that's really what this is about, then I wish everyone would come up with more (and better) categories than these two.

The WWII books are very light on rules because the rules are all in the core books.<br><br>And I am *quite* sure we're disagreeing, unless you've so drastically misstated your point of view as to say the opposite of what you mean.<br><br>When I say "In A Wicked Age is a story game because stories are what it does," it goes well beyond "rules inspire story."  Story is the *only* thing you can do with those rules -- they are entirely focused on who has narrative control, and they have no provision for any kind of objective representation of the characters, for instance.  If we're playing IAWA and I ask, "which character is stronger?" -- well, we can come up with a subjective statement about it, but that's it - the rules have no advice one way or the other.  Further, if a player says, "My character is strong enough to lift the boulder blocking the entrance to the cave" -- if there's no character there who wants to oppose that, it just happens, because the IAWA rules are all about narrative control and there is no provision in them for overriding what another player says, short of having your character interfere. <br/><br/>It seems to me that this is why your taxonomy fails: if we apply it as you have explained it, we come up with the result that GURPS is a story game and IAWA is a trad game.  This does not line up with common usage. <br/><br/>Accounting for Taste:  I think distinguishing between categories of games is quite useful - it's when we say one is better than another that problems come up.  It *is* a big, sprawling hobby, and having a way of understanding things quickly means I can spend a lot more of it on the parts I like without having to invest a lot of time in figuring out whether any given game is going to be something I like.

It only has stats for attributes, skills, powers, and heart rate - which model the reality of the world where agents interact with that alternate dream reality.  There aren't any explicit mechanics for story elements.  <br/><br/>This distinction isn't that important to me personally, though.  A system that models the fictional world well supports interesting in-character choices and consequences to those choices - which for me is an interesting side of stories.  So depending on what sort of style of story creation I'm looking for, I may try an approach with more or less modeling in it - while still being focused on dramatic story.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite><a href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">@cwilbur</a><br/><br/>it's cool we can disagree, but i'm not sure we are just yet.<br/><br/>To me a game of gurps is nothing but a story inspiring rules, it's trying very hard to be explicitly that.

Having categories to put things in makes our brains happy, there's no denying that.  I especially like the boardgame model, where you can file everything into multiple categories, letting you use whatever division will actually help you in a particular situation.  That can be useful, sure.<br/><br/>But having <i>only two</i> categories?  Which apparently are meant to separate games not only by their mechanics, but also by their design philosophies, by the era in which they were made, and by the people who like them?  I think there's a huge problem there even before the usual "...and this is why what we do is better than what they do" nonsense crops up.<br/><br/>edit to add:  I should say that I mean that splitting the big sprawling world of RPGs into two categories isn't useful <i>for me</i>, because I'm only interested in finding and playing games that I will enjoy, and in learning how to play and enjoy those games more.  But I notice that it's usually the people who are really interested in game design who keep coming back to this trad-vs-story theme, so I'm guessing that they are getting something out of it.

During that evolution, certain forms of story focus in play produced problems with authority, some of which could be solved culturally, and some of which caused cultural abuses. Ultimately of the branching solutions to this (in addition to, for example, cultural techniques and their evolution) designing games to mitigate these problems by mechanically allocating story-focused authority more clearly and enjoyably became a valuable alternative. <br/><br/>So ultimately what we are seeing is some problems and then some solutions arising to meet those problems in the decades long evolution of the story game, which is just a part of the evolution and innovation of roleplaying games in general.

Yes; these qualities are often depending on the GM-techniques and the group-dynamics. So what? The GM is part of the game, and are supposed to develop some techniques to master it. Group dynamics will play a part whatever game you play. My question is:<i>How do you boil this soup into greatness?</i></blockquote>A tentative answer may be that we need to discover more about how to master the game, and how to harness the group dynamics.<br><br>I've had good experiences simplifying my thoughts on how to lead players in a role-playing game. My experiences may be listed in three simple paragraphs:\n<ol>\n<li>Be polite, kind and welcoming</li>\n<li>Be calm, firm and clear</li>\n<li>Be observant, make use of opportunities and play the players</li>\n</ol>\nThis is the key to good leadership in a role-playing game, to me. It is all about the attitude of the GM, and how it rub off on the players, creating enthusiasm for the interaction.<br><br>Now; this is essential to me; how this "informed agent of the game" (the GM) works to make it something special. By giving the GM the advice needed, and effective tools, the game-smith has the chance to imprint both a playing style and a mood on the game, through a living agent. As clearly shown in new games within the classical paradigm, like <i>Dogs in The vineyard</i>, <i>My Life with Master</i> and <i>3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars</i>; the demands on the GM may be <i>greatly eased</i>, with the effect of strengthening the game.<br><br>How can this be? I believe it is due to present designers being more knowledgeable on the tools needed to make a functional and happy GM. They keep their advice clear and simple, and place more effective tools in the hands of the GM (and the players).<br><br>I believe that this is a very fruitful development, and one that will bring great things to the tables in our near future! We are growing up, as designers, and role-playing games as an art-form, is growing up with us.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288069/#Comment_288069" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T16:18:20+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  4:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>this is story inspires rules<br><br>to set up a conflict in a traditional game requires a large number of story choices.

For me, most RPG designs can go either way.  That is, I may read a set of rules and then think "Hey, this gives me the idea for a cool game."  Other times, I may have an idea for a set of characters and situation and think "What rules can I use for this?"  <br/><br/>So, for example, I recently played in a Werewolf: The Apocalypse game.  For that, we started by just agreeing on the rules - and reading them, we got inspired and decided "Hey, let's play a group of werewolf rock stars."  From there, character creation gave us a colorful group and we worked from there.  The same goes for when I ran Macho Women With Guns - just starting from the rules gave me lots of ideas for the one-shot adventure I ran of it.  <br/><br/>Conversely, I've done a number of games where I've started with an idea - like my Korean dragons game, set in the world of Naomi Novik's Temeraire series.  For that, I had the idea for a game, and I decided to use Spirit of the Century for it.  On the other hand, later on I joined with a group playing SotC straight, and then I went to the rules for inspiration on what to run using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288070/#Comment_288070" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T16:22:21+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  4:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I should say that I mean that splitting the big sprawling world of RPGs into two categories isn't useful<i>for me</i>,</blockquote>\nWell, if I only had two categories to divide things into, it wouldn't be very useful for me either!  <br/><br/>But if you picture the big sprawling world of RPGs as a map, I can draw a line, and say that things on that side of the line are story games, and things on this side of the line are trad games, and things close to the line are not strongly one or the other.

There are a number of older games that had more specific material so that you could start play out of the box including Run Out the Guns, Ghostbusters, Sandman, and many others.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288075/#Comment_288075" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T17:48:10+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  5:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2010 6:04PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>But if you picture the big sprawling world of RPGs as a map, I can draw a line, and say that things on that side of the line are story games, and things on this side of the line are trad games, and things close to the line are not strongly one or the other.

Maybe it's just that people end up talking the most about the games that straddle the line, though; because they defy the easy binary classification, everyone ends up having to work that much harder to squeeze them into such a highly-simplified picture.<br/><br/><br/>Really, I think I'm just fishing for someone who's deeply invested in drawing this particular line to step in and say why it has to be THIS line, and why it doesn't actually matter that many (most?) games apparently draw elements from both sides of the line.  There's got to be some compelling reason why it keeps coming back to "story games versus traditional games," even when there's little agreement on what particular factors make some games fall on one side or the other without resorting to the old "I know it when I see it" gag.  <br/><br/>Eventually it just starts sounding like an identity thing more than an actual distinction.  "Games I like nowadays are story games and have all these wonderful new qualities...games I used to like before are traditional games and have all these hoary old conventions that held everyone back."  And at least under that system, you know it doesn't actually matter how you draw the dividing line, because the point isn't to have a way of making useful distinctions between two groups, but simply to HAVE two groups.  But I suspect that's an incredibly uncharitable way to look at it, and I'd like to hear a better explanation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288077/#Comment_288077" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T18:32:53+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  6:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure it's fully baked yet, or even correct, but I've been working on the hypothesis that "trad games" are games which can be mechanically reduced to either GM or group-consensus based "what would be best for the story" decisions and the mechanical procedures and participant decisions are effectively an elaborate distraction from that. The classic examples would be a GM asking for a series of task rolls until you roll the result he wanted for the story result he felt was appropriate. Or fudging die rolls to keep important characters alive in the story. Or dynamically scaling the opposition to control the story pace. Or peer-pressuring someone to make a decision one way "for the good of the story". Or having so many bennies / story points / etc. that failure is never a realistic possibility, so the game is just a series of elaborate descriptions of the challenges you face. I'm not confident in this definition because I'm not sure that there are enough games that <i>don't</i> do this. Also, I think it would put a lot of games played with an "old school" style outside of my "trad" definition, but I think that's probably appropriate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288082/#Comment_288082" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T19:07:18+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  7:07PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i dont really think placing particular games into particular categories is all that helpful. i think identifying what the games are doing is great. analyzing the play is what i care about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288083/#Comment_288083" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T19:31:12+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  7:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>Hardly -- a character can lift a heavy object, interacting with the world, and have no drama at all involved, because there's nothing at stake.

The classic examples would be a GM asking for a series of task rolls until you roll the result he wanted for the story result he felt was appropriate. Or fudging die rolls to keep important characters alive in the story. Or dynamically scaling the opposition to control the story pace. Or peer-pressuring someone to make a decision one way "for the good of the story". Or having so many bennies / story points / etc. that failure is never a realistic possibility, so the game is just a series of elaborate descriptions of the challenges you face. I'm not confident in this definition because I'm not sure that there are enough games that<i>don't</i>do this. Also, I think it would put a lot of games played with an "old school" style outside of my "trad" definition, but I think that's probably appropriate.</blockquote>\nAn interesting thing here is that several people assert that there is an important distinction between classical/traditional games and modern/story games - but they are very different distinctions.  I think they're all interesting and important distinctions, but I think it would definitely be clearer to use more specific terms than traditional RPG versus story game (or worse, modern RPG).

Classical games are rules heavy, and is much about letting the players pick their character-resources at a broad buffet. These resources come with certain rights within the fiction, rights that may be invoked by the player. You may argue that the GM adjudicate the use of said resources. She does, of course, but that's part of the <i>interaction</i> going on between GM and players, and ordinarily a boon to the games. Done badly it will support your claim that the GM distribute resources, but making general definitions on bad praxis is no way to go.<br/><br/>As for modern games having resources mostly being distributed by rules; reads good to me. A lot of modern games, at least of the US-persuasion, have not only rules distributing resources, but have the interaction strongly regulated too. It may be said that the interaction is more ritualistic and singular in modern games, than in classical games. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>traditional games require a significant amount of prep to come up with the starting context for the game<br/>post modern games usually have rules to come up with that context</blockquote>Hmm ... you may be right about traditional games, but "significant amounts" is a bit slanted; there don't always have to be much preparation for such a game to take off.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>those devil worshiping games with strange dice some times call themselves universal<br/>those small overpriced games tend to be very specific</blockquote>Devil-worshoipping games <i>are</i> universal!

Who said that?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I wouldn't have a problem with (for example): "The GM-and-players tradition". Or maybe "the dungeon crawl tradition".</blockquote>\nWhat adjective do you want me to add to tradition to describe the thing I'm talking about? All of the words I can think of are based on negation from other categories and therefore potentially off-putting. "Storytelling tradition" might be good, but I don't want people to think I'm only talking about White Wolf games. "Authorial tradition" might be good, but it's an awkward phrase and I don't want people to think I'm talking about "Author stance".

All the time. Have you read Vincent's clouds, boxes, and smiley faces? You want to understand game design better, read those, understand them (I'm sure Vincent would love to help you out if you're having trouble undestanding), and then look at the games you like (and don't like), and see how their rules work along those lines. You'll learn a heck of a lot more doing that than you will trying to classify games into arbitrary categories.<br/><br/>As a bonus I'll tell you that boxes that lead to boxes mechanics almost never work for me. Almost every time I'm in those games  we end up forgetting to add fiction because the fiction just doesn't matter. This happens to me a lot in <i>Dirty Secrets</i> during conflict resolution. Interestingly, <i>Serial Homicide Unit</i> is composed entirely of boxes to boxes. You could play an entire game without any fiction whatsoever. And yet, oddly, it never happens there that we forget to add fiction, I wonder why that is?<br/><br/>On a totally different wavelength, I most often abhor game mechanics which pit player versus player. This is another example of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>. The conflict resolution mechanic tests which player is better at playing Liar's Dice, the characters don't matter at all, nor does the fiction, just each player's skill level.<br/><br/>Note, I'm picking on <i>Dirty Secrets</i> here because, other than the conflict resolution rules, I love the game, and I'm the only person I've ever heard complaining about them, so I figure my point of view is so minority that it won't hurt Seth's sales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288155/#Comment_288155" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T13:17:48+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  1:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And it would be a mercy if the people who think this discussion is useless would find something else that interested them to discuss, preferably in another thread, instead of telling those of us who are getting something out of this one that we're wrong, stupid, misguided, repetitive, and pointless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288157/#Comment_288157" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T13:54:40+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  1:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Would it surprise you to hear that people have been saying this for a long time?

Now, I think this distinction is especially true *once play begins* (most classical games actually have *more* detailed rules for things like starting equipment and spells, after all).  But really, the important thing isn't that resources are distributed in a particular way\u2014it's the effect such explicit distribution has on the power structure at the table.<br/><br/>For many of us, finding games where it is made explicit the extent and nature of the authority each participant has in the game was really revelatory.  So many of our prior bad experiences were made comprehensible.  Furthermore, we now knew how to avoid having such experiences in the future.<br/><br/>In my experience, and that of others who strongly identify with story games over trad games, the single most important determinant of whether a game will not only be fun, but also not actively unpleasant, is whether or not the GM has to follow the rules the same way the players do.  I've played some hideous sessions of (games that were billed as) DRYH and Lacuna with GM's who thought the rules of those games didn't matter and they could apply them haphazardly.  I described those experiences as "trying to play an indie game with a trad-minded GM," and people basically knew what I meant.<br/><br/>In other words, it's all about the social contract, which is the outer layer of the big model, and more important than even the hallowed and much fought-over GNS.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288194/#Comment_288194" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T20:56:13+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  8:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2010 9:55PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>It would help me communicate my gaming preferences to others, and help others communicate their gaming preferences to me.</blockquote>\nYeah, but unless you're in some kind of low-oxygen environment where every syllable you utter is hastening your inevitable demise, you can actually just talk about what your gaming preferences are directly, using specific games as examples.  (And if you ARE in a low-O2 environment, you shouldn't be thinking about gaming!  Save yourself!)<br/><br/>So while it would be nice if RPGs developed useful genre tags the way music and art and movies and novels have, it's not exactly the most pressing need on anyone's agenda.  And I should point out that NONE of those other things started off by saying "There are two types of (whatever): the old kind, and the new."  That's apparently just not how you build a useful nomenclature.  Actually, I suspect that people develop working, robust genre nomenclatures by starting with "A is like B and C; D is more like E and F; G is a little like A, but grew out of H and is therefore very different."  So maybe what we need to do is stop trying to create broad simple categories to encompass everything, and instead start by creating narrow, highly-focused categories that only encompass specific games?  It'd certainly be easier to get the kind of mutual agreement and understanding that you need to actually use that vocabulary in a conversation.<br/><br/>edit:  To summarize:  maybe the way to get a good set of categories to improve communication about RPGs is to AIM LOWER.  Pick a few games that seem to have common elements, and make that a category.  Discuss how they fit that category.  Do the same for a another set of games.  Eventually, you have a bunch of little categories that are fairly well-defined and easy to agree upon (even allowing for drift and works that deliberately cross categories), like we have with music and movies and art.  Build from the bottom up rather than the top down, etc.  And with narrower categories, picking out influences and shifts in design paradigms will probably get easier, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288198/#Comment_288198" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T22:08:37+00:00" title="August 22, 2010 10:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding genres of RPGs...  A while ago, I made a breakdown of RPG genres called <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/fashions.html" rel="nofollow"><b>"A Brief History of Fashion in RPG Design."</b></a> That was in 2003.  Today, I'd have to add in Forge-influenced story games, Jeepform, and Old School Renaissance at least.  <br/><br/>Obviously, there are people who see an important split between Forge-influenced story games and traditional RPGs, which there are compelling reasons for.  People do identify strongly with one or the other - but the interesting thing is that they state identifying for very different reasons.  For example, some people prefer Forge-influenced story games for the focus on thematic elements, while others prefer them for the stricter rules and consider "old school" to be part of their preference.  I think that really there are a number of factors including some that have nothing to do with the game features themselves.  I say this mainly out of experience with other splits within RPGs.  In the nineties, there was a major divide between dice-using and diceless games, which were argued very earnestly and had strong feelings and identification on both sides - as well as other divisions.  The divisions are very real, but I think there is often a lot going on regarding identification beyond simple features of the rules or even social contract.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>In my experience, and that of others who strongly identify with story games over trad games, the single most important determinant of whether a game will not only be fun, but also not actively unpleasant, is whether or not the GM has to follow the rules the same way the players do.

That is the one defining point of classical and modern games, in my view. So I draw a line there. The one point setting "story-games" (as a sub-category of modern games) apart from classical games, is how these games place a bigger focus on playing the story, and less focus on playing the character. So I draw a line there too.<br/><br/>Mind you, these are <i>lines</i>, not walls. No need to bang your head against a line. Step over it if you like.<br/><br/>As for making diverse genres in rpgs, it would be interesting. It would all be about thinking through how a game works, placing it in relation to other games, and discussing it with your peers. I imagine that we would group them on basis of the method, the inter-media references of the text, and the kind of fiction they produce. Making such genres is not a thing I'm invested in at the moment, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288205/#Comment_288205" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T23:59:11+00:00" title="August 22, 2010 11:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>you can actually just talk about what your gaming preferences are directly, using specific games as examples</blockquote>\nExcept that there are so many games out there that it's common to not have a large overlap with other people, so it's not really that simple.

Lots of things are divided into two categories, so I don't think it's ridiculous to hypothesize that a two category system might work for RPGs, but I don't see any special reason to assume that having exactly two categories is appropriate either. A bottom-up accretion model would certainly be an interesting approach, but as Thomas said that's outside the scope of this thread.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>That is, I could run Don't Rest Your Head in a manner of strictly following the rules or following them haphazardly.

It seems like you're in line with that, as you state this as "can happen" (rather than does happen) and how "many" (but not all) of those games have such advice.  We can divide games up into: (1) Has "rule 0" advice text; versus (2) Doesn't have such text.  However, in that case then a lot of early RPGs would be lumped with the story games.  <br/><br/>It seems like what you're really doing is classifying games as traditional based on other criteria, and then lumping them all as "haphazard rules" regardless of what the rulebook actually says.  <br/><br/>In practice, GM advice is easily ignored.  Sometimes a game may advise rule 0 and yet some people play it strictly by-the-book - I'm thinking particularly of Champions here, which has a large set of very strict-rules fans.  Conversely, a game may not advise rule 0 and yet some people play it while applying rules haphazardly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_288214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288214/#Comment_288214" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T01:57:57+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  1:57AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2010 2:01AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>It seems like a good starting point for determining what design paradigm lies behind those particular games would be to first figure out which games you're looking at.</blockquote>I'm looking at the games I've played. Those I find roughly groups under the labels classical and modern. <i>Classical</i> being the games with GM, and <i>modern</i> the games without (to rephrase my initial definition). The use of a GM is so strong both in regard to the social structure of the player-group, and the workings of the game-method, that it deserves being (and is considered to be, by most players) a defining trait.<br/><br/>I am sure there are other defining traits in games, both classical and modern. In modern games we find strong currents of games focused on story, diverse in their particulars, of course, but still sharing in some important traits (example; a mechanically induced "meta-stance"). In classical games we find "universal rpgs" (GURPS) and more tightly themed games like Paranoia, Toon and My Life with Master. In both we find various thematic genres; star-opera, cyberpunk, fantasy, etc. You may classify games based on how they are published, as in "indie" and "mainstream", and see that this classification crosses the line between classical and modern.<br/><br/>Most ways of classifying games will cross the dividing lines of each other. This does not make classifying the games futile. It only goes to show that there is several points of view by which we may think and talk about role-playing games. We do classify games, and discuss classifications of them, due to it being useful to our understanding of them. As a game-smith I find that by classifying games in easy to recognize groups, I can evaluate them with greater ease, by comparing them with games of the same "persuasion". And thus I have a first layer of organization to my thoughts on games, in relation to my own design-praxis. As I am designing games both in the modern and classical field, that's quite helpful to me. It saves me from a lot of confusion and fruitless trashing about in the dark.<br/><br/>But we are still talking theoretical lines here, and we should be eager to jump back and forth over the lines, back and forth between classification (different points of view). To reach any useful understanding of the games we design and play, we have to be flexible in our thinking.<br/><br/>It is very nice of you to take time debating this! I really appreciate the level of commitment you all have shown in this thread!

I don't think I'd be so quick as to label it like that, but even during playtesting we had some specific responses from those who are used to traditional gameplay that amounted to "where are the hit points?" and "this is one of those storyteller games."<br>\n<br>\nSMALLVILLE differs from our earlier Cortex games most notably because it switches out Attributes and Skills for Relationships and Values, but that's more of a mechanical label switcher. The more "indie" elements take a little longer to surface if you're only just flipping through the game. It is very much a game with a GM (Watchtower), who in fact is solely responsible for framing scenes and ending them. But players have enormous narrative control within those parameters, and the Feature characters (NPCs) that Watchtower controls are really only there to poke at the Relationships between the Leads (the PCs). I wonder if tilting the lines of approach toward drama away from the standard "we're here to fight the monsters" is what really provokes the reactions.<br>\n<br>\nCheers,<br>\nCam                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288236/#Comment_288236" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T07:01:00+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  7:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>We can divide games up into: (1) Has "rule 0" advice text; versus (2) Doesn't have such text.

Is picking which game you want to play a play choice? If we play by the rules of Ganakagok but say that we're playing Polaris, what kind of choice would that be? How about it we sit down to play Polaris, but try out some house rules that you've been considering, only to later discover that your house rules make the game identical to Ganakagok in all but name? And if we get bored with RPGs, we can try my hide-and-seek variant that streamlines the game by getting rid of the part where "it" closes his eyes and counts.<br/><br/>Some "choices" are big enough that it's fair to say you're not playing the same game anymore. Others aren't. Right? Some games include "optional rules" which contemplate playing them multiple ways. If you're playing within one of the contemplated options that the game explicitly endorses, then it's probably reasonable to say that you're playing that game. (Some games include a rule that all other rules are optional, or are conditional on a particular participant's preference). If you're playing by rules that are close to, but not identical, to what's in the official rules then you may be in a gray area, and it depends on how critical the specific changes are to the game (e.g. changing whether or not you can use your hands in soccer is a big deal, changing how many points you get per goal is essentially cosmetic).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288278/#Comment_288278" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T09:03:53+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  9:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Dan about this, actually.

But it is a play choice that is closely associated, at least for many of us, with the Forge and post-Forge schools of design.  In other words, it's a <i>cultural</i> phenomenon\u2014like I said, it's certainly possible to play something and call it DRYH and not follow the rules in the book.  This happens sometimes when you get someone from a different play culture trying to run it.  Similarly, it's possible to play Vampire RAW.<br/><br/>Now, personally, I <i>do</i> think a lot of the OSR people are much closer in philosophy to me than most traditional players and GMs.  The thing about Old-School games is that the ruleset is generally not complete, and requires the GM to creatively interpret what the player-characters are doing in terms of the rules.  However, once I realized that the GM is expected to facilitate the players' creativity, and be neutral about what happens, rather than antagonistic, it all began to make much more sense to me.  In other words, while the GM may do a certain amount of on-the-fly design, the GM is still expected to be fundamentally honest about mechanics in a way that he is not, in, say, Vampire.<br/><br/>So, for me, rather than a twofold partition, my experience leads me to a threefold one that quite thoroughly covers the entirety of my tabletopping experience.  (Those three categories then do obviously have subcategories.)<br/><br/>1) Old-School: rules set incomplete, GM as neutral and honest arbiter and interpreter of the world<br/>  Examples: several early versions of D&amp;D, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, other retro-clones, Delve, and, to go a little further, probably Over the Edge as well<br/><br/>2) Trad: rule 0, GM "controls the story," rules may or may not be detailed but the degree to which they matter varies highly<br/>  Examples: 2nd Ed. D&amp;D, Vampire, GURPS<br/><br/>3) Indie: no rule 0, there may or may not be a GM, but all participants are equally bound by the rules<br/>  Examples: in addition to the obvious ones, 4E is often played in this style, which clearly makes the indie label null and void, but there ya go.  4E can also be played in a very Old-School style, with awesome results in my one experience doing that.<br/><br/>Regarding ignoring GMing advice\u2014that idea relates to something that I've had a big bug up my ass about for some time now, ever since talking to jenskot about people who play 4E without allowing "stunting" (p. 42 of the DMG).  Which is this: that the <i>procedural, social</i>, and, in general, <i>non-numerical</i> rules of a game are as important as the number stuff, yet they are far more routinely and casually ignored.  This is an unfortunate trend, because it absolutely ruins a lot of games.  (That bad game of DRYH wasn't problematic because the GM was fudging rolls, but because he wasn't following the purely textual rules about how to make the game "go.")  Those textual rules often give great advice for the kinds of things a GM should be doing, or that a player should be doing for that matter.  Yeah, that's more wiggly than hard-and-fast numerical rules about damage or whatever, but it's still pretty obvious, at least to me, when they're being ignored.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288285/#Comment_288285" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T09:30:22+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  9:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>If we play by the rules of Ganakagok but say that we're playing Polaris, what kind of choice would that be?</blockquote>\nA play choice.<br/><br/>I don't even see how this is controversial at all.  The designers of both games were killed with meat cleavers after they published their games, so it can't possibly be a design choice, they have no more choices to make after their game is published, they have no agency, they are nothing, they are less than nothing, they are only persons to yell at me on the Internet.<br/><br/>Well, anyway, good luck storming the castle.

To me, this looks functionally equivalent to the choice between playing Ganakagok or Polaris. The design choices were the choices that made Ganakagok and Polaris into different games that we could choose between.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I can tell there's something <i>really really really</i> important that you want to get across</blockquote>\nUh, OK. Based on the frequency with which you raise the topic of house rules, drift, etc., I figured you were the one that was deeply invested. I thought the point I was trying to make was trivially obvious.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>My disagreement is that there are a lot of largely traditional games that do not have Rule 0 text, and that have a substantial subset of gamers who play strictly by the book.</blockquote>\nWhich is why I think there's more to it than just Rule 0. I would think of Rule 0 as a means to an end of achieving trad play, not the definition of it. You can achieve a lot of the same effects with "GM calls for rolls whenever he wants, GM sets target numbers he feels are appropriate".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288361/#Comment_288361" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T15:06:13+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  3:06PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2010 3:09PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>I would think of Rule 0 as a means to an end of achieving trad play, not the definition of it.

It is a statement that says that it's fine for you and your friends to use your best judgment and do what works best and is the most fun for you, even if the author didn't manage to think of it first.<br/><br/>Since this is going to happen anyway -- the groups who do these things typically don't sit around waiting for permission to do them -- writing rule zero in a game book always seemed to me to be less "our rules don't really matter" and more "your play experience is what matters the most."  It's going in there to say that if you and your friends want to change something about the game, the author isn't going to give you shit about it (and hopefully no one else who is not playing at your table will give you shit about it either).  The author frankly does not care what you do with the game, as long as you buy it and have fun.  If you run into trouble with the "having fun" part, you can come ask on the website for tips about using the rules "properly," or you can find your own solution, it's all good.<br/><br/><br/>Omitting any mention of rule zero is perhaps a more interesting game feature to discuss:  is it a statement from the author that there really is one and only one way to play the game?  A step away from the idea that a game text is something you hand to people and let them pursue their own fun and their own goals with, and towards the notion that a game text is a highly-specific tool to create a highly-specific experience, and anyone who doesn't want exactly that shouldn't be playing it?<br/><br/>Or is it a reaction to perceived abuse in past game experiences?  There's no rule zero because your old DM was a jerk who set aside the rules whenever it would screw the players over the most, so therefore THIS game will have no rule zero, and no jerk DM will ever harm another soul.  No rule zero, no changes to the rules, everyone has to stay within these boundaries so it's fair for everyone.<br/><br/>Or is rule zero being left out because the author thinks it simply goes without saying?  The people who are going to modify and drift the game in small or large ways are going to do it with or without a Rule Zero to tell them it's okay, so why waste your precious wordcount on it?  The people who run into trouble will either ask for the author's help on the website, or they'll "fix" it themselves: either way is fine.<br/><br/>Or is it something else?<br/><br/>All in all, I think there are more (and more interesting!) reasons to <i>not</i> write up rule zero in a game text.  When someone puts rule zero in, there really aren't many ways that can be interpreted...but when someone leaves it out, it could mean a lot of different things.<br/><br/>And maybe that's a shift in design paradigm right there: the absence of rule zero in some new games suggests that at some point, different ways to approach game design sprung up, not all of which were compatible with an explicitly-stated rule zero.  Older games may simply have never even considered the possibility that there was a market for a game that had to be played exactly the same way by everyone, in order to produce a very specific experience -- but obviously you can't have that sort of game if the author is telling the players to ignore or change rules to create their OWN desired experiences.  Older games may not have considered the possibility that it would be fun if no one at the table had the ability to step outside the rules, that working within those restrictions would create more interesting play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12790/games-classical-and-modern" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12790/games-classical-and-modern" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12790/games-classical-and-modern/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12790%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12790%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
