It's a bad habit, full stop.  But the Apocalypse World multi-character thread made me think about this a little bit. So let's talk about spotlight hogging and how to deal with it under different situations, because I'm starting to think that maybe just saying "don't do it!" is not that great.<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/><br/>A player is taking the spotlight time because their character is <i>boldly coping with dramatic situations</i>, whereas others are being more cautious or uncertain, maybe putting themselves in the "follower" role, or just not engaging that much with the situation of the game.<br/><br/>This is a situation where spotlight hogging can occur "for good reason", in other words, the reason everything is centered around this character (or subset of characters) is because they're the ones actually doing things.<br/><br/>Here are some thoughts on this situation:<br/><br/>Ensure that follower characters are getting a choice to put themselves there, and make that choice have some consequences. In other words, if the team's on a mission, and the spotlight hog is pushing things forward, agonizing over the big decisions, and others are just following their lead, have someone demand to know why the non-spotlight character isn't doing something, or insist that they do something, or compliment them on their support role, or ask them to support other things.  This will reward the people that actually like doing that sort of thing, develop consequences for their decisions, and give them opportunities to choose to do other things, but not make things "bad" if they don't.<br/><br/>Here's another example:<br/><br/>A player is taking the spotlight time because <i>they are the out-of-character leader</i> of the group.  The group looks up to them, their expertise, their charisma.<br/><br/>This one's more intractable, I think about this one a lot because I have a player like this in my group.  (Sometimes I am this player, often at a convention for some reason people don't really like to interact much with strangers? I assume that some people just like throwing money at convention organizers for no reason, given that this is all a convention is?)  Because it's at the social level, nothing you do inside the language of the game is really going to change things.  The charismatic player might not even be intentionally doing it, and if they try to devolve responsibility on others, the group will certainly resist that.  The only thing that I think can really be done here is to embrace it. Be sure that you give everyone a chance to do what they are comfortable doing, but go ahead and have the charismatic player be the one pushing the group forward. Pitch plots and difficulties straight at them and make it clear (like, TELL THEM) that you expect them to delegate tasks and objectives to others in the group.<br/><br/>But maybe someone has a better idea?<br/><br/>Here's another example:<br/><br/>The spotlight hog loves to act - I don't just mean play a role, I mean they love to talk in the voice of their character and interact with NPCs.  The ones that prefer to describe conversations or have characters who aren't conversationalists get pushed out of the limited play time of the group because the one player's specialty/preference simply takes more time to adjudicate.<br/><br/>One thing is that I only really noticed this when I began to play with light systems with modest handling time (in the early 90s, though they existed long before that).  AD&amp;D's combat system, for example, took up a lot of time, so the players that preferred combat to conversation would undoubtedly have their spotlight time too just by virtue of the time footprint of their preferred action.  With streamlined combat systems, but still a "say what your character says!" conversation rule, the conversationalist began to dominate the session far more.  Social systems that don't replace "say what your character says!" make this worse, because it adds additional handling time onto the conversation.<br/><br/>The only thing I've been able to do here is to get players who prefer other things (stealth, combat, what have you) to be really detailed in their descriptions.  In other words, even if the combat system is highly slimmed down, I have them describe very thoroughly what their character is doing and how.<br/><br/>Other spotlight hogging situations you've encountered, and how to deal with them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336525/#Comment_336525" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-31T12:24:09+00:00" title="July 31, 2011 12:24PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2011 12:25PM by Nathan_H.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if ya get rid of the whole one gm thing, this more or less goes away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336527/#Comment_336527" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-31T12:44:39+00:00" title="July 31, 2011 12:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely it does not.

Similarly, a person who is boldly making interesting choices for their character may rightly despise games that ask them to step out of that role and do something against their character or make choices on behalf of God or fate.

We do not know how to give "screen-time" to the meandering, quiet characters. but it is possible. <br/><br/><i>Doing things</i> may be described to great <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effect</span> ...<br/>- while <i>not doing anything</i> (being hesitant, bewildered, dumbstruck, etc.) may be described with a lot of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affect</span> (that is; descriptions of tiny details that hint on the state of mind, the true position, the inner whirlwind of feelings, and so forth ...).<br/><br/>I find it a challenge to make space for such characters in role-playing games. In the action-packed games of the mainstream rpgs (fantasy, space opera and horror) the challenge is, of course, even more substantial.

The later can't adapt to situations, so if you willingly want to play with such a person, you and the group of players will have to find a way to deal with that specific person, make a houserule to give that person as much spotlight as neccesary and/or develope some other way to have fun on your sessions.<br><br>I've been in a campaign (actually just part of the whole campaign) with a player like this. He can actually be reasonable most of the time, but the GM always makes the mistake of keeping the action with him instead of letting other players share spotlight, since this player is the one most aware of the big picture of the setting (space-opera galaxy-wide conspiration) <br><br>Because of the GM reaction, perhaps this isn't exactly the case discussed, however my point about the group looking for other source of fun in the game is this: In this situation, it became a custom among the players to create characters that would conspire against our spotlight hogger; or plainly make his life more difficult. Watching him deal with these challenges became amusing enough for the players, not to the point to turn the game into a GM &amp; NPCs against a single player, but close enough. Neither the group, the GM nor the player have any complain right now, and the campaign is still going on.<br><br>Now, if you're dealing with reasonable people and you happen to have enough tact about adressing with situations that affect everybody in the table, I wouldn't call it "hurt the feelings" to the act of dispensing a little discipline on the table. Everybody wants to have fun, you've agreed to play an RPG, it has written rules, the group has unwritten rules and whoever goes against any of those is as guilty as those who remain silent and resented to such players. Discipline isn't something that kills the fun, it's a tool for sharing the fun with more people.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336703/#Comment_336703" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T15:43:29+00:00" title="August  1, 2011  3:43PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2011 3:44PM by jenskot.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Evan Torner</cite>But what if it's basically one player, and he/she knows that system is being implemented more-or-less against them in particular?</blockquote>\nGood question! I've had this happen. This is what we did...<br><br/>Explain that the scene card means:<br/><br/>- your turn is over temporarily to keep the pace swift and give everyone their fair turn<br/><br/>But it doesn't mean:<br/><br/>- your scene is bad, some of the best scenes can be long<br/>- you can't continue the scene when it is your turn again, just start from where you left off (think of the scene card as a pause button)<br/><br/>Additionally, I will usually say something like, "I often get so into a scene that I don't realize how much time has passed so the scene card helps me know when to pause and let someone else have a turn. It gets used during my scenes all the time. It's not a bad thing. It's a great tool to keep track of time." I'll even turn a friend aside and ask them to use the scene card on me first as an example and make it clear it isn't personal.<br/><br/>You could also set a general guideline that scenes get to be at least 5 minutes long (or whatever you want). So don't use the scene card on a scene unless it has been at least 5 minutes. <br/><br/>If it is still a problem... it's actually a gift in disguise! It might underline some sort of deeper social problem at the table to watch out for.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336704/#Comment_336704" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T15:55:47+00:00" title="August  1, 2011  3:55PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2011 3:56PM by jenskot.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tangent\u2026<br/><br/>We sometimes use an X card. If some content makes you uncomfortable, lift the X card up, explain what content is the issue, and then we remove that content, no questions asked.<br/><br/>BUT\u2026<br/><br/>Every time you do this, write your name on the back of the X card. When any one person uses the X card more than 3 times, we stop the game and talk about if there is a problem with the game, a disconnect in expectations, or if we will need to change the game's direction to make it more fun for everyone. If writing someone's name down makes them reluctant to use the X card, have someone else keep track. <br/><br/>This almost never happens. That said, it makes everyone (in my experience) more cognizant and empathic to the needs of their fellow players. And if someone has a problem with the game, they can use the X card to signal us to take a break and realign what's going on. For many reasons, the ability to simply lift a card makes people much more comfortable in voicing their opinions and interrupting others before they go too far into uncomfortable territory. <br/><br/>I've thought about implementing a similar rule with the Scene card. If you use it more than 3 times, we take a break and realign. But we've never had to so I haven't tested it out. We've actually had people excited when someone uses the scene card on them! So I've been reluctant to build a solution to a so far non-existent problem. The X card is a different story. <br/><br/>Jason, thanks for starting this thread.

The guy getting 9 fate is taking up a lot more table time than the one who only got 3. The extroverted players tend to self-compel a lot, and those that are a little more passive tend not to. It's a good metric to allow me to think about pushing a few fate chips their way to engage with their character.<br/><br/>I track tests with Burning Wheel, which allows me to see who's getting more time using their abilities.

If someone's used a half dozen skills in Burning Wheel or D&amp;D or some similar skill based game, and the other players haven't used any, then there's a situation where the spotlight time is becoming uneven, and there should be a switch of spotlight to the other players. I think that it's something that an extroverted player should keep an eye on, and if they see that they've been rolling or engaging the system a bunch, they should take a moment to step back. Again, visible metrics (fate points, checked off experience, or skill checks) provide a tangible, visible example of the amount of game time they're using up.  <br/><br/>Now, that aside, I think that there's a certain amount of responsibility to share spotlight. As someone who is guilty of hogging spotlight, I try to involve one or two other players in the scene I'm attempting to play out.  In a combat, I'll call out to another person, engage them in some sort of strategy.  In a skill roll or challenge or whatever, I'll ask someone for help.  If I'm trying to romance someone in a talky scene, I'll go to one of the other players for advice.  I think that the more the spotlight becomes a dialogue between a few players at the table, and importantly a dialogue that shifts from player to player (I've had the two players at the table that do everything together, in full Bromance, excluding others) then this issue becomes lessened.<br/><br/>There's a mindfulness of others that I think is really important. Those who are extroverts or social leaders really have to remember to be inclusive and helpful in involving your friends at the table. Spotlight hogging is really bad when the player in question is wearing blinders, focusing on their character and ignoring the people around them. I think that if we used our spotlight hogging methods to involve and include other players, it is a good thing for the game in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337149/#Comment_337149" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T13:00:01+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  1:00PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I've thought about implementing a similar rule with the Scene card.

But I suspect, as you say, the Scene card being used is not necessarily a sign of something bad, as with the "X" card.<br/><br/>I've even seen one game (unWritten) that gives you a bonus when you use your power to cut short a scene! It's called "buttoning", and the system encourages it with a reward.<br/><br/>It's certainly worthwhile to give some thought to the way scenes end: it's often a good way to establish drama or mystery. For instance, if a character says something really dramatic... it's three times more powerful it's the very last line of the scene than if the scene goes on and on afterwards.<br/><br/>Television shows are generally very good at this (perhaps overused in daytime soaps!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
