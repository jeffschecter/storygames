Let me know what you think!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/66cToaH.png"/><br/><br/><b>The Score</b><br/><br/>\u201cOur operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody.\u201d<br/>\u2013Lando Calrissian, The Empire Strikes Back<br/><br/>Cloud City has always operated on the fringe of the law, but its tibanna gas mining has kept its Baron Administrators wealthy and powerful enough to preserve the city\u2019s autonomy. Even Palpatine\u2019s overreaching galactic empire has kept its hands off of the city\u2019s not-strictly-legal operations, making the Bespin city something of a haven for ambitious entrepreneurs, gamblers, and miscreants.<br/><br/>However, rumors have begun to spread of Imperial transports landing in the city. Some even report Darth Vader himself has been meeting with Baron Administrator Calrissian. Tensions are running high, and the city of six million waits on edge. Is it time to pick up and leave the planet, or is there time for one last score?<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7tke2XBxlYoUmhlalVKbFZnMDA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7tke2XBxlYoUmhlalVKbFZnMDA</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450753/#Comment_450753" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T02:28:07+00:00" title="January 20, 2016  2:28AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!<br/><br/>I was going to suggest it could be mined for other people wishing to play Star Wars... but it's actually more crime-drama/Fiasco in spirit. Which is excellent for its purpose!<br/><br/>I can imagine the Star Wars genre potentially causing issues (e.g. a good vs. evil vibe taking over, or players being too concerned with "canon"), but players familiar enough with the spirit of Fiasco shouldn't have a problem. Sounds like fun!<br/><br/>I like how the "Siblings" relationship suddenly takes on a whole new level of meaning simply by appearing in a Star Wars-themed playset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
