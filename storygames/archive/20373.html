DW is excellent for that D&amp;D adventure feel with the smoothness of the AW engine, but I wouldn't use it for grittier fantasy since the archetypal classes, XP &amp; levels and alignments feel too stereotypical and D&amp;Dish. <br/><br/>On the other hand BW is just a bit too crunchy for my taste, especially Fight, but I like the lifepaths, the learn-by-doing advancement and beliefs to drive a dramatic game. So I stripped Dungeon World of the things I didn't like and slotted in the things I like about Burning Wheel, thus: Dungeon Wheel.<br/><br/>Below is a link to the <del>3</del> <del>4</del> 7 page PDF. It only shows the changes I've made to DW (Character creation using BW lifepaths, stat advancement without levels, beliefs and "artha" for DW and some miscellaneous changes to moves/stats/how skills from lifepaths work).<br/><br/><a href="http://frozendepths.net/rope/Dungeon%20Wheel.pdf" rel="nofollow">Dungeon Wheel</a><br/><br/>You need to be familiar with both DW and BW to understand it, but I'm hoping there are quite a few people here that meet the criteria. I'm visioning this hack for fast-ish paced adventure drama gaming, less heroic and lower fantasy tone than DW, kind of like medieval Apocalypse World with beliefs to drive play and flag content for the GM. It certainly shouldn't require dungeons to be interesting despite the working name.<br/><br/>Now the question to those that have played said games more extensively, do you think this could work? Would it satisfy your adventuring needs on the DW side, and your desires for drama on the BW side?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448778/#Comment_448778" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-27T12:06:00+00:00" title="September 27, 2015 12:06PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat.

I ignored it because it kept the archetypal idea of classes intact, but I never thought to use it as a master index of compatible moves. That's an awesome idea, I'll add a suggestion pointing that way to the PDF!<br/><br/>In my vision moves from lifepaths are quite rare, I'd make moves for sorcery, faith, armor training and such special mechanics, but it certainly doesn't have to be that way. You could make a move for Ditch-Digging, but I'm not sure how useful that would be. Now that I think about it, some of the mechanical traits could be converted into moves.<br/><br/>This is one of the things I was considering, does a character need a lot of moves or is it fine to have mechanically very similar characters. My current answer is that mechanically similar characters feel more human and gritty instead of special-snowflake heroes. But it might not be the final answer.<br/><br/>As for the stats, the stat bonuses from lifepaths are a good guideline combined with the general idea of the lifepath. A mental stat bonus can be social or intelligence related, but the lifepath usually breaks the tie. I'll add some words about this to the PDF as well.<br/><br/>Another thing I'm still considering is the set of basic moves, do they support the right kind of interactions in the right way, but I guess I'll need to playtest those to get any real data. The set of adventurous DW moves plus a bit more drama oriented support in the form of Read a Person feels generic, but workable.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448791/#Comment_448791" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-28T17:19:42+00:00" title="September 28, 2015  5:19PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really neat!

(I have a feeling you probably have.)</blockquote>\n<br/>I have seen your your descriptive damage hack, yeah, and I'm really torn about it. I like the idea, it's definitely grittier than diminishing HP totals and I like BW's take on damage and injury (easy to get injured, hard to die), but if I'm working with Dungeon World as the base game to hack I'm stuck with numerical damage in numerous places in the system. It wouldn't feel entirely elegant to slot in descriptive damage for PCs, but keep damage dice against monsters.<br/><br/>HP has its advantages for the fast-paced action the move framework supports, though. It's a guaranteed, transparent plot armor for a hit or two, so the players can take more risky actions without the game stalling for a planning break. Using a riskier injury mechanic would slow down the conversation I fear.<br/><br/>Another reason I didn't adopt the damage hack was that I like using tried and proven components instead of playtesting too many experimental mechanics at once. Your hack would require more fine-tuning than just lowering maximum HPs and introducing serious injuries via Last Breath. If I decide to make more radical changes to DW I'll reconsider it.<br/><br/>So in the end I feel DW does descriptive damage well enough if you keep fiction first in mind during combat. Now I started wondering if your hack could be used as an extended combat subsystem though... Likely unnecessary, but a fun thought experiment. <br/><br/>Did you get to playtest your hack? Did you further fine-tune it, for example in terms of healing and appropriate maximum HPs the PCs should have?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448813/#Comment_448813" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T17:15:17+00:00" title="September 29, 2015  5:15PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2015 5:19PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks. I agree with your notes; like I said, the intent of my hack was precisely to make things feel much more "gritty" and "dangerous". That's why I mentioned it here: it sounded like it might be exactly what you were looking for. I can see how it might be too much detail for a more story-oriented version of DW, however.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with the version I eventually came up with in that thread (you'd have to read the whole thing to compile it at this point, I haven't put together a document myself), including the really key component of making "soft moves" on a 7-9 rather than going directly to damage. If you'd like, I could type up a "summary" of the rules I settled on.<br/><br/>But I haven't actually played Dungeon World, so I haven't playtested it in the context of that game. (My experiments have been confined to simple rules a la World of Dungeons.)<br/><br/>On a sidenote, I've never understood why people are so concerned about the assymetric nature of the hit points. In my mind it's pretty similar to AW: players track how many hit points they lose and how many hit points of damage they inflict. The GM handles when opponents die, just like in AW. But I do understand that this is just a case of personal taste, and that's very fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448814/#Comment_448814" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T17:44:14+00:00" title="September 29, 2015  5:44PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you'd like, I could type up a "summary" of the rules I settled on.</blockquote>\nI'm sure many folks (myself included) would appreciate that!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Glowie" title="Glowie"><img alt="Glowie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Glowie">Glowie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448822/#Comment_448822" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-30T07:56:53+00:00" title="September 30, 2015  7:56AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2015 11:34AM by Glowie.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On a sidenote, I've never understood why people are so concerned about the assymetric nature of the hit points.

Now all I need is time to playtest this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450063/#Comment_450063" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T09:03:50+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  9:03AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem here is that a character created using BW Lifepaths may be <br/><br/>Porn in the Village -&gt; Failed Accolyte -&gt; Village Peddler -&gt; Village Wife <br/><br/>and be a perfectly fine BW character but completely underpowered for Dungeon Wheel becasue all the mechanics of DW are still there and they push you into a Dungeon Crawling game and that game alone.

I came to similar conclusions after running my DW campaign longer. I can now answer my own question in the opening post: This hack doesn't satisfy all that I asked of it. Which isn't terribly surprising as I just quickly and naively slapped together a few cool techniques.<br/><br/>However it did spark my interest in game design. My DW campaign ended successfully yesterday, so now that some of my RPG time is freed up I'm going to start a serious game design project around this idea. I still like the vision behind this quick hack: Burning Wheel's creative goals done using a fiction-first system powered by the AW engine. And this time using a horror/low fantasy setting instead of something inspired by Tolkien. Conspiracy of Shadows is something I'm looking into as far as setting inspiration goes.<br/><br/>I've already done some research though there's still a lot to do on that front, and just about everything in the current version of this hack will be changed. We shall see how a lifepath based character creation scheme works in a PbtA game among other ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450069/#Comment_450069" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T17:26:44+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  5:26PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should definitely look at some of the existing PbtA low fantasy games, like AW: Dark Ages, and John Harper's "Eye of Chaos" (there's a draft on his blog), or other hacks like the Hyborian Age/Sagas. <br/><br/>None are exactly what you're looking for, I think, but could be worth looking into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450078/#Comment_450078" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T06:21:56+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  6:21AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;We shall see how a lifepath based character creation scheme works in a PbtA game among other ideas.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>I'm definitely excited about this!

Unfortunately I didn't join AW: Dark Ages' playtest run so I don't think I have access to that. I only got World of Dark Ages from the forums, hacked by a fan. Hyborian Age I have already looked into. These games focus on somewhat different things in terms of system compared to my idea, which is a system that more strongly shows how your decisions and the actual situations you go through change your character, in terms of values, traits and skills, but they're still full of good ideas.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm definitely excited about this! Could be as simple as, take this LP, get +1 to this stat and pick from one of these three moves.<br/></blockquote>\nYep, my thoughts are currently along those lines. The idea I'm experimenting with is that the moves you get from lifepaths represent the genre relevant skills you learned during that part of your life, these "skill moves" having individual modifiers that improve when you use the move and there being harsh penalties when using skill moves with a root stat (so unskilled use might mean you can't get a full success result). <br/><br/>This means there's no big pool of basic moves to rely on, your character just isn't very good at resolving situations they're not used to. Which leads to mechanical character change when they start trying.<br/><br/>I'm writing this out if someone spots clear mistakes in my design ideas and I can then quickly correct them. Also, 2d12 to make the range of viable modifiers larger, since +2 is the absolute maximum I'd allow in a darker toned game with a 2d6 roll!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450092/#Comment_450092" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T19:22:47+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  7:22PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds interesting.<br/><br/>I think you should start by making a list of the features you want to keep from both games, and which ones you aren't interested in.
