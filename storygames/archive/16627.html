In this case, it's Korean but once I get a working model I'm hoping to do versions for other languages as well. Essentially, all the players attend a school for magic (the game is loosely based on The Magicians, by Lev Grossman) and they cast spell by speaking Korean. Low level spells are cast by putting a noun and verb together (like Ars Magica) but is contextually based so they are no overarching categories - the noun and verb will be different depending on the spell. So step one: build vocab. After that, players cast spells of various types by making simple sentences. Different types of spells require different grammar patterns. Illusion spells are simple statements as they are the easiest to cast, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to cast spells players narrate scenes in which something affects them negatively - this earns them drama points which are then used to cast spells. Magic is fueled by pain and emotional scars and wounds acquired by the players. It is the players responsibility to narrate scenes to acquire drama points and the GM's responsibility to narrate scenes that present challenges and conflicts that require the expenditure of drama points (by casting spells). In addition, the role of GM changes each turn. So when it is a players turn to narrate a player turn they frame a scene designed to gain drama points and when it comes their turn to narrate a GM turn they add to previous GM turns by introducing conflict, adding to the overall storyline, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd really be grateful for any feedback on the game. Here's a link to the pdf for all those willing to look at it!

Usually the first couple rounds around the table don't have much need for spell casting and the players need to frame scenes in order to build up their cache of points so as to be able to cast spells. It's really up to the players, whenever someone has the GM token (their turn to take a GM turn) they can introduce a conflict if they so choose, even on a player turn a player can decide he wants to frame a conflict scene but I've found players tend to use their player turns for acquiring points and their GM turns for introduce conflicts that require the use of said points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to start people off with a couple points but I've found it enjoyable to have that build-up to conflicts. The group I game with here in Korea has a vested interested in learning Korean however, so they're all about casting spells and they've even been studying in between sessions to build up a stronger vocabulary base. I'd really like to see how it plays out with groups that are more in it just for the casual play of it though - my experience with playtesting is so far entirely based in Korea. So, for playtests over here (and because it's a continuing campaign), I'd say maybe10-20 of every hour is spent speaking Korean per person at the table since casting a spell doesn't really take that long and you don't have to negate other spells quite as much. At "higher level" play you'd spent a lot more of it speaking Korean though - to cast spells you need to make full sentences, to block spells you have to repeat the sentence but in the negative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380673/#Comment_380673" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T01:53:21+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  1:53AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the elegance of having the iPhone's Siri adjudicate whether you've correctly pronounced your spell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380676/#Comment_380676" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T04:46:10+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  4:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

It's hard for me to grasp because I can't relate it to any references that I'm used to. Overall, it seems very roleplaying heavy. Other than story goals, how does each character win? I can't be going around killing things at every turn like DnD right? Is there a base stat to define the initial state of scene economy? I really like the advancement and conditions. I see this game as Cthulutech mechanics with Harry Potter themes with undertones of the movie, Chronicle. I think there should some separation between roleplaying mechanics and combat/tactical mechanics to avoid some confusion. How do you define the degrees of effectiveness of a spell? I didn't see any mentions of dice rolls. Is everything point buy system to take certain actions? If I have that one spell that always works can I use it over and over again? Wouldn't that make me not try out new words? Or... if i can say the same phrase command in multiple combination, am I breaking the game? LOL I'm not so sure I'm helping much with the mechanics. Let me know if you got some Korean application issues; I may have better input to that.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nMy response:<br/>\n<br/>\nHey dude, it's a diceless, essentially GMless game. You don't need any stats - the only thing on your character sheet will be the different wound levels with tokens to show how many points you have, your "wound" describing your emotional scar that allows you to cast magic along with a few adjectives that describe the dysfunction and your "want" which is your quirk of the thing your character wants/does that he does because of said emotional scar. If your wound is "neglected and undeserving" his characteristics might be possessive and untrusting while his want might be to have close, trustworthy friends and to gain respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure what you mean by "win" like win in a fight or something? Basically, I tell players that anytime there is any conflict to be resolved it should either be resolved with spell casting or simply roleplayed through. The whole point of the game is language learning so anytime you need to do something you should be casting a spell. Need to convince someone you're right ? cast a spell that makes them believe you. Need to get somewhere quickly? cast a spell to make you faster/ be able to jump over buildings/fly, etc. In terms of fighting and winning in a battle all monsters have a certain number of points to determine how strong they are. A weak little animal or something would only be a one-point monster and so would only need a spell that cost one point to cast. A bigger, magical creature might be a 10-point monster so it would require 10 points worth of spells to be cast on it but might have other things going on that require tactics to take it down. For example, it might have a shield on it that soaks up the first spell cast on it - so if a player puts 5 points into their first spell, they'd be wasting it, etc. So you'd "win" by successfully hitting the creature with as many points worth of spells as necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoleplaying is there, essentially, for players to acquire the points they need to cast spells. In addition, they get points by putting their characters in situations where they experience negative emotions of some kind - getting beat up, humiliated, or other crappy things that may happen in high school. Basically the message is that all the shitty things that happens to you make you stronger (because it fuels your magic).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, to take actions you either cast a spell that does something, anything, or defend yourself, run away, etc. But all conflicts are resolved via magic - the more spell casting going on the more language learning. There are no dice rolls - to determine if a spell is cast properly or not, the player uses his or her iPhone or Android phone's Siri or Dragon dictation, etc to determine if he cast the spell correctly. If you dictate to the phone and it comes up correctly, you correctly cast the spell. If not, you miscast the spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nDegrees and effectiveness of spells need more playtesting but, essentially, the more points you pump into the more effective it becomes. If you wanted to affect a bigger area you need more points, a one-point spell will do one point of damage, a 3 point spell will do 3 points of damage, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers would technically be able to cast a spell over and over again and I assume this will happen on occasion, but I'm assuming they're playing to learn the language more so the more creative and different the spell, the more they're learning and the more fun it is. In addition, if they're battling another mage and they keep using the same spell it would be easy for the mage to negate it, right? To negate a spell you just need to write it down in the negative and speak it. So the more they hear it, the easier it would be to negate. Speaking the phrase in multiple combinations would be a better strategy for sure! But the easier or more similar it is, the easier it will be to negate!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dbrown" title="dbrown"><img alt="dbrown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/133/nMWVBVRKLGUBK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dbrown">dbrown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382165/#Comment_382165" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T22:23:57+00:00" title="June 12, 2012 10:23PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't access the PDF link above, so I'm not sure entirely how the conflict mechanic works.
