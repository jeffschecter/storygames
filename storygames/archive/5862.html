The Purples formed the other faction, dedicated to compressing the asteroid belt into a single planetform, to recreate their long lost homeworld.<br/><br/>War in space is dangerous, and neither side was particularly interested in slugging it out.  Luckily Earth was nearby, and had become completely overrun by Vampires some centuries earlier.  Vampires, being undead, have no need for food, water, or air, and thus make excellent astronauts.  Their ability to turn into a cloud of gas can also be quite useful (especially when dealing with high Gs).    The Elves hired their own band of mercenary Vampires, the Purples a different clan.<br/><br/>Thus began the Elf / Purple Vampire War Of The Belt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131789/#Comment_131789" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T17:37:15+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  5:37PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.
