It's a good fit for the current project (Jianghu/wuxia/everybody knows everybody and has a history) but I like it as a general technique. Like many occasions when called upon to make a list, I seem to be struggling to remember all the good examples I thought of in the bath.<br/><br/>Here's what I have so far- please give me some more questions or suggest cunning revisions to the existing ones.<br/><br/>Why do you trust/distrust him?<br/>Where have you met him before?<br/>Why does he despise/admire you?<br/>Why is his appearance good/bad news?<br/>What reason does he have to want to kill you?<br/>Why does his presence bring back unpleasant memories?<br/>Why are you glad/unhappy to see him?<br/>What secret does he know about you?<br/>Why do you fear him?<br/>How does his arrival make the quest easier/harder/more complicated?<br/>What rumours have you heard about him?<br/>Why are you now in extreme danger?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292489/#Comment_292489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:14:08+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:14AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, so this is basically using the technique called "Fishing", but applying it specifically to NPCs.  Interesting.<br/><br/>No ideas for more questions, because a lot of that comes up in play, but interesting nonetheless.<br/><br/>I notice that this basic question (which I've used many times) brings interesting actions from the players:<br/><br/>"You notice something... not quite right about him. Something perhaps disturbing? In any case, you feel your adrenaline begin to surge.

For that reason, I'd suggest throwing in curve-ball options.  Encourage the players to state why they love the NPC, or why the NPC loves them.

I'll make sure that I make it clear that the schtick should only be used once or twice for each NPC, to avoid escalation. On the other hand, I think you could probably construct an entire game based around that kind of round-robin NPC creation, if there isn't one already.<br/><br/>Jamie, that's a good way to deal with potentially placing someone on the spot, but the game I'm writing for can be quite contemplative most of the time, so I'm going to suggest that the player asked the question can get help if he has no ideas, but that even the simple, obvious answers still work.<br/><br/>Good suggestions so far everyone, and thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292918/#Comment_292918" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T17:10:13+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  5:10PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One I used in a game once was:<br/><br/>"What favor did you get from him that you still owe him for?"  <br/><br/>It was an Amber quiz question and so anything could have been the subject of the devil's deal.

One game that does it real well is Apocalypse World. I think the GM has a general rule to ask questions like this, but they are also built into chargen in the form of the History rules. In our last game, the Gunlugger had as one of his History choices to decide which one of the other characters left him bleeding. He chose me, and narrated how he was bleeding out on the ground in front of my workshop and I just closed the flaps and left him there. Then Colin as GM turns to me and asks me "why'd you leave him bleeding?" That set me back on my heels for a sec, until I looked at my own history rules for my Savvy-Head, which has me reduce my history stat with one PC because "I got better things to do." So, I left him bleeding cause he wasn't any of my concern and I had more important things to do. Worked for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
