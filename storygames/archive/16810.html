I'm coming up with a few custom playbooks (most of the originals will also be available.)<br/><br/>The APPRENTICE is mostly a hack of the Witch; where the Witch works as a self trained hedge magician, the apprentice tends to be someone trained within the White-Council style of magic, and has powers more in line with what the wizards in Harry Dresden do.<br/>(Also, Witches can learn up to 2 Wizard Spells, and Wizards can learn up to 2 Witch Hexes, so there can be some overlap.)<br/><br/>I considered making Soul Gaze a move, but instead, I think it's just color on one of the basic moves: if a wizard locks eyes with someone, they both Gaze into the Abyss.<br/><br/>THE APPRENTICE<br/><br/>So you're a wizard.  You would think that would be fun and games, except you've got an overbearing mentor making sure you learn magic the right way, a whole council of overbearing wizards just waiting for you to slip up and prove to them you're evil, and you're not even allowed to use your spells for anything fun.<br/><br/>Well, maybe it's time to change things up.  You have a power coursing inside of you, and woe be to those who stand in your way.<br/><br/>Names:<br/>David, Elisabeth, Harriet, Jonathan, Maximus, Minerva, Prudence, Roland, Severus, Victoria<br/><br/>A powerful name, a virtuous name, a complicated name, an ancient name.<br/><br/>Look:<br/>Nervous, scrawny, old-fashioned, stubborn.<br/><br/>Cunning eyes, powerful eyes, soulful eyes, eyes that contain the universe.<br/><br/>Origin:<br/>Child of a wizard, stumbled into arcane secrets, trained by a dark mentor, otherworldly patron.<br/><br/>Stats<br/>Hot -1, Cold -1, Volatile +1, Dark +1 (choose and add +1 to one Stat)<br/><br/>Apprentice Moves:<br/>You get Spellcasting and Sympathetic Tokens, and choose one more:<br/><br/>*Spellcasting<br/>You can cast spells.  Start with two.  To cast a spell, spend a sympathetic token during a secret ritual, or meet the target's gaze and chant at them in tounges.  Then roll with the appropriate Stat for the spell.  On a 10+, the Spell works.  On a 7-9, it works, but choose one:<br/>*The casting drains you, take -1 forward to Spellcasting until you have a chance to rest.<br/>*The spell has unexpected side effects.<br/>*Trigger your Darkest Self.<br/><br/>*Sympathetic Tokens<br/>You gain power from sympathetic tokens: items of personal significance you take from others.  A Sympathetic Token counts as a string and can be used to power ritual magic.<br/><br/>*Blackest Magicks<br/>Whenever you violate a Law of Magic, gain xp.  (To violate a Law of Magic, Kill with Magic, Conrol the Minds of Mortals, Raise the Dead, Summon Demons, or Transform Mortals).<br/><br/>*Toil and Trouble:  When you have time and access to a proper work area, you can brew up a potion.  Name a condition, such as Angry, Forgetful, or Madly in Love.  Whoever drinks the potion gains that condition for a few hours.  Player characters must Hold Steady to resist acting in accordance with the condition.  NPCs will have their sense of self dominated by that condition.<br/><br/>*Unbidden Summoning: When you whisper the true name of an entity, roll + Dark.<br/>On a 10+, they come to you, and you gain a String on them.<br/>On a 7-9, they come to you, and will listen to you.<br/>On a miss, they come to you, and are angry for the interruption.<br/><br/>Wizard Spells:<br/><br/>*Elementalism (Volatile)<br/>You conjure fire, cold, or lightning.  Elementalism deals 2 harm to one target, or 1 harm to everyone in an area.<br/><br/>*Hexing (Dark)<br/>You cause a piece of technology to short out and malfunction for a few minutes.  Cameras cease to record, guns jam, computers blue screen.<br/><br/>*Memory Wipe (Dark)<br/>You cause the target to forget a few minutes, up to an entire hour.  On a 10+, you can also put alternate memories in their place.<br/><br/>*Transmute (Volatile)<br/>You turn something or someone into something else.  A pencil becomes a knife or crowbar.  A person a frog or statue.  A vampire a lawnchair.  Eventually, the changes wear off.  You can't create life from nothing, but you can turn living things into inanimate things.<br/><br/>*Veil (Dark)<br/>Veil hides you behind a web of illusions, making you appear invisible.  As long as you concentrate, the spell persists.<br/><br/>Backstory<br/><br/>You start the game with two Sympathetic Tokens.  Decide who they came from, and what they are.<br/><br/>You have a Mentor who keeps an eye on you.  They gain 2 strings on you.<br/><br/>You wish you could be friends with one of the others.  They gain a string on you.<br/><br/>Advancement<br/>*Take another Apprentice move.<br/>*Take the remaining spells.<br/>*Learn two Witch hexes.  You cast them with the Spellcasting move.<br/>*Collaborate with the MC to create a new Spell.<br/>*Take a move from another skin.<br/>*Take a move from another skin.<br/>*You belong to a Wizard's Cabal.<br/>*Add +1 Hot (max +3)<br/>*Add +1 Cold (max +3)<br/>*Add +1 Volatile (max +3)<br/>*Add +1 Dark (max +3)<br/>Sex Move<br/><br/>When you have sex with another character, you both erase each other's highlighted stats, and then highlight Dark and choose another stat to highlight.<br/><br/>Darkest Self<br/><br/>You tap into a font of true power, and the time for action is now.  You will make your will known.  Your  spells become supercharged, more powerful than you can probably responsibly wield, and they all have unexpected sideeffects.  You escape your Darkest Self when someone you care about confronts you and talks you down.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383621/#Comment_383621" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T14:22:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  2:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pure awesome, I dig the moves as well as the idea of playing Monsterhearts in the Dresden setting.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383624/#Comment_383624" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T14:40:59+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  2:40PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

On a successful roll, your mentor will answer your questions and provide advice instead of visions. On a 10 up add these to the list of options: they've seen it all before, remove a Condition; they bail you out, choose another NPC who has a String on you and give that String to your mentor instead.  On a 7-9, add these to the list of options: their answers are clear, but they demand a task of you; they are disappointed in you for asking, choose one of the 10 up options and they gain a String on you.<br/><br/>(Edited to clean it up and to rework the option to have a someone elses String removed on a 10+, though I'm still not sure about short-cutting the drama that way.)  Also, maybe it is large enough to be a full separate move rather than a basic move modifier, though I referenced gaze into the abyss because of the potential for other move modifiers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383655/#Comment_383655" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T18:47:29+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  6:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is super cool.

I could easily see a husk of a PC switching to Hollow, making a bargain and going Infernal, being embraced, or obviously coming back hungry or ghostly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/harleqwn" title="harleqwn"><img alt="harleqwn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/harleqwn">harleqwn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385008/#Comment_385008" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-13T00:16:03+00:00" title="July 13, 2012 12:16AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice fit here, Willow. <br/><br/>I've played AW only once.
