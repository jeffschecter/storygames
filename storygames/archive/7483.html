We've got an ongoing PTA game which is a reality-show-within-a-show, called Zurvivor, mentioned here before, about the making of and dramas in a reality show on an isolated island infested with zombies, complete with bigmouthed producer, deathwish zombie wrangler, uptight federal agency overseer, and so on.  It's on TNT.<br/><br/>A different group got together at Ides and made what may very well be a sequel to Zurvivor, called Copz. Set in and around a fortress city and several fortified towns coming under its feudal control, Copz is the story of a roving group of law enforcement officers in a zombie-infested America falling into feudalism. The interesting thing about it was our choice of what network to put it on and what style it should be in.<br/><br/>"I think it should be documentary style." said one player.<br/><br/>"Lots of handheld cameras, jittery images, the cameras follow the action..." I prompt.<br/><br/>"Yeah...but what if it was a propaganda piece?" <br/><br/>It turns out that the show, a propaganda/documentary is actually being broadcast inside the game world to promote support for this program and the idealistic politician (a Connection of one of the PCs) behind it.<br/><br/>And then we decided that halfway through the season, the documentary begins to record things that the propaganda masters don't like, and they axe the show, it ends up on a cable station somewhere out at like channel 831.<br/><br/>This is the first PTA show I'm aware of where the cancellation of the show was planned as <i>part of the story arc.</i><br/><br/>Anyone else done anything like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166348/#Comment_166348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T15:09:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  3:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool.<br/><br/>For our show, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2545" rel="nofollow">The Line</a>, we didn't plan the cancellation exactly, but there was an episode where we said, "Yeah, this is the last episode that was broadcast. The show is too weird and the ratings are just too low. After this, we're doing the shows you can only get on the Special Edition DVD set."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
