<p>This came out of, uh, watching Poirot DVDs and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=188" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.</p>
<h1>Little Grey Cells</h1>
<p>This is an Agatha Christie-style detective game that proceeds in three phases. One of the players, the Investigator, controls the detective Hercule, and any other figures with no stake in the crime other than solving it. The other players, ??Suspects??, control other characters.</p>
<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>First, decide on a location, like, "On a tour of Egypt," "Haythornethwaite Manor," "The Way We Remembered That Day," or whatever. This describes the locale in which the imagined events will occur. Characters cannot generally leave the locale in a substantial manner. While they can run out for an errand or some such, they can always be found.</p>
<p>Play proceeds in a series of scenes. Whenever there would be a set change in a movie, or when an animation would speed-time, such as when the focus moves to another room or when the daylight changes, there is a new scene. PHRLAR WHO IS IN A SCENE HERE</p>
<p>You need a piece of paper or something for each Suspect character.</p>
<h2>Phases</h2>
<h3>Beginning Things</h3>
<p>In the first phase, Motives and Evidence may be introduced. The first phase ends when a Murder occurs.</p>
<h3>Investigation</h3>
<p>In the second phase, Motives, Findings, and additional Murders may be introduced. Evidence may only be introduced by Hercule. The second phase ends when at leasy one Murder is Solved.</p>
<h3>Cleanup</h3>
<p>In the third phase, no further Motives, Evidence, or Murders may be introduced. The third phase ends when all the Murders have been Solved.</p>
<h3>Cops Are Terrible</h3>
<p>(Optional) In the fourth phase, only Motives and Findings may be introduced, for the purposes of overturning older Findings and clearing characters' names. Hercule's Findings cannot be overturned in this phase; only Findings made by other persons are in doubt.</p>
<h2>Motives &amp; Suspects</h2>
<p>A Motive is a fact about a Suspect's feelings toward other Suspects. These have one of two natures:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Suspect X prevents me from having ___, which I want/need."</li>
<li>"Suspect X has hurt me by ___."</li>
</ul>
<p>To assign a Motive to a character, comment upon his behavior toward another character and speculate why he acted this way. Note the Motive down on the Suspect's sheet.</p>
<p>Each character has a pool of dice labelled Suspicion. Suspicion indicates the possibility of unrevealed Motives. At the end of each scene, add one die to Suspicion if the character was present, and two if he was not.</p>
<h2>Evidence</h2>
<p>Whenever a character does something that has impact on the physical setting, it leaves Evidence if the phase permits it. Take an index card or something and jot down the substance of the Evidence. Place three dice on it.</p>
<h2>Murders</h2>
<p>You may frame a scene with the discovery of a body of one of the Characters. This indicates that a Murder has occurred.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>Findings convert Suspicion and Evidence to Motives. Do (dice mechanic), which produces a numeric result. This generates Findings, which suggest that a particular character has committed the murder. Add dice to a Motive.</p>
<p>Findings can also explain away Motives, reducing their dice.</p>
<h3>Solving the Murder</h3>
<p>When a Motive's value exceeds the total Suspicion of all characters, two things may occur. If no investigator is not present, one of the Suspects involved in that Motive <em>cracks</em> and reveals that he did it. If Hercule or another investigator <em>is</em> present, he may Solve the murder, explaining that this is why it was done. Non-Hercule investigators aren't always right.</p>
