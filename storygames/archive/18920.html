Not having played it before, I've studied the rules carefully and read some discussion on the internet. Several things are still unclear to me, however, so I hope you people can help me out.<br/><br/>1. Is it possible to upgrade the "hand-to-hand" weapon? From the description, it seems as if it isn't really a weapon at all, so upgrading it makes little sense. But the rules are not explicit about this.<br/>2. What is the advantage of the powerblade? It deals d10/-/- kills, and has no special abilities. The flamethrower deals d10/d6/- kills, and has no special abilities either. Why would anyone ever request a powerblade?<br/>3. Page 19 tells me that you can change weapons on a successful NFA roll. Is this meant to describe one of the things you can do with an NFA roll, or is this something you can always <i>also</i> do with an NFA roll? The former seems much more logical, but on page 23, one of the characters takes "a successful NFA roll to change range and weapon," which seems to imply that changing your weapon is a free part of any NFA roll.<br/>4. Do normal and emotional wounds stack? E.g., if a character has one physical wound and 2 emotional wounds, is that character dead?<br/>5. Is it true that AA and FA are asymmetrical in the sense that while aliens cannot cause kills to anyone who rolled a higher success, PCs can kill aliens even when the aliens rolled a higher success?<br/>6. Not really a rules question, but something I wonder about. FA allows you to make kills, and allows you to change range when you have a higher success than your enemies. NFA allows you to change range and switch weapons. So you can change range with both, but only switch weapons with NFA. However, switching weapons is rather useless if you can change your range -- you just move yourself to whatever range is best for your default weapon. So NFA sounds rather underwhelming compared to FA. Is this meant to be balanced out by the fact that NFA allows you to improve your weapons faster between missions?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423109/#Comment_423109" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T05:11:17+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  5:11AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the answer to questions 2 and 6 is, at least in part: "the rules work like this in order to crate a link between high rank and ineptitude"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423110/#Comment_423110" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T05:29:26+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  5:29AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I've got one more question!<br/><br/>7. The GM always uses AA. But there is no AA between missions (one planet has been destroyed, the other may not have even been chosen), and yet there can be conflicts with NPCs between missions. Is there a rule for this, or should the GM just decide on a number to use?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423118/#Comment_423118" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T07:40:09+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  7:40AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a guru but I've stared at 3:16 a lot, so I'll have a go at it.<br/><br/>1. No.  Your assessment is right; you can upgrade the melee weapons, but "hand-to-hand" is more of a state than an actual weapon.<br/>2. Because it's AWESOME and you can use it near power plants in popular movie sequels.  Also because doods of various ranks come in with weapon picks; at Captain or higher, you start with a free Power Blade.  Think of it as table stakes rather than something you aspire to if it helps.<br/>3. It's not super clear.  NFA is cited as "perform the task attempted" rather than "perform the tasks attempted" so I'd say it's intended to be the former.  It might play well as the latter though, helping balance it against the all-empowering FA.<br/>4. Hm... page 45 says you should clearly mark it as exhaustion and not killing damage, so no, they don't stack.<br/>5. Yyyyyes.  Though if AA is highest, the alien has the ability to blow their success and make everyone else in the round fail - a good tactic if they see a bunch of PC successes lined up.<br/>6. It's kinda like that, and kinda like ineptitude, and kinda... 3:16 is rather easy to break if you approach it pragmatically.  It's not a balanced game and I don't think it's meant to be.<br/>7. Why not use an AA between missions?  Some officer has made it their mission to make your lives a living hell.  He does emotional damage with his AA of Blah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423120/#Comment_423120" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T08:02:59+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  8:02AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Veav. As for question 4, surely you have to clearly mark them because the rules for <i>healing</i> are different? (You always heal all E-damage, but you heal only one point of physical damage.) So that doesn't really settle the question of whether they stack, I'd say.<br/><br/>As for question 7, I would of course expect to use AA -- it's the only thing you have as GM -- but what <i>is</i> the AA in such a situation? Is it the AA of the last planet? The new planet? What if no planet has been chosen yet?

Turned out that she had been sent to test a new energy cartridge for the troopers' weapons, which exploded when the aliens used their special ability. So, the players found lots of dead troopers with exploded weapons, as well as some of the cartridges. (Which they tried, and which then exploded.) Then they found the dead lieutenant, evidently shot by her own troops after she had tried to force them to continue using the weapons. Finally, they rescued the now unarmed troopers from the aliens, at which point they had to decide whether to report them for killing their lieutenant or not.<br/><br/>"The aliens killed Lieutenant Frederiks." our sergeant said.<br/>"No sarge, I'm sure these sons of bitches did it themselves!

Yes, its profile on p.80 says so. It is the killing power of a variety of \u201cweapons\u201d in hand-to-hand combat. You can improve your killing power.<br/>2. A Flamethrower sets everything alight, which is sometimes a problem. But I think you meant Shotgun over Powerblade? A Powerblade is quieter, pretty cool for cutting through walls and frozen ice, and for wearing on ceremonial duties. I'd go with a Magnetic Maul, though, if I got promoted and given a Powerblade. I'm sure the Brigadier would take a Shotgun or Rocket Pod off you when you go to see them. Not sure they would make you remove a "ceremonial" item.<br/>3. You make a successful NFA roll you can change weapons. You make a successful NFA roll you can change range. You make a successful NFA roll you can do whatever it was that you were trying to do. For example, "read the Field Manual" is a good one I often see used to avoid being killed in combat (if you have a high NFA -- sure won't remove any Threat Tokens, but what do I care says the Lt).<br/>4. All Kills fill in the next box available. Just that you write E in the box and not a cross if it\u2019s E damage. E damage all goes away between encounters, but that\u2019s only an advantage if you\u2019re not already a Mess to start with.<br/>5. AA does a mix of everything so the GM doesn't have to think. FA does kills, NFA does not. They are all different from each other.<br/>6. NFA allows you to change range no matter what your enemy rolled. Very important distinction. Especially when that enemy moves you first\u2026 If I had 10 cents for everyone that said NFA was clearly better than FA I would be very rich. Equally if I had 10 cents for everyone that said FA was clearly better than FA was clearly better than NFA I would also be rich. I\u2019m not rich, more or less, so we can\u2019t all be right.<br/><br/>7. Use the AA you picked until a Mission is over. Then never use that equation again. If you need a new AA before planetfall then pick a new equation, and that's what they're getting until the Mission is over.<br/><br/>Keep Soldiering On.
