The problem with not writing much is not that the big writers somehow will drown you out, but rather that if you are always terse and never personalize the terseness, it comes off as untrustworthy: the other guy will imagine that you're talking more with the other players and not talking seriously with him. For instance, I don't consider terseness a problem if you tell me that you're going to be terse (thus nullifying the suspicion that your terseness is a subconscious signal) and then follow that up by going to the point and discussing the things we minimally need to: tell me what you want, tell me what you're willing to give, tell me what long-term cooperation we could have. Anything more is only necessary when you're trying to explain your strategy to the other guy, anyway. Heck, I'm all for bullet-points if the player is clear enough on his strategy to provide them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I am more prone to stab you if your terseness is combined with non-communication: if I don't know what you're planning and you refuse to commit to anything plan-wise, then I lose nothing by making prey of you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280119/#Comment_280119" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T10:57:42+00:00" title="July 12, 2010 10:57AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero himself is quite terse much of the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280120/#Comment_280120" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T11:01:36+00:00" title="July 12, 2010 11:01AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ::busts out laughing::                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280121/#Comment_280121" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T11:11:27+00:00" title="July 12, 2010 11:11AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Eero stops talking to you, it's because he's afraid he's going to give something away.

As you know, Mike, the playdiplomacy server will send each player an e-mail asking him to log in and confirm that he intends to play. Once that happens, the Spring 1901 diplomacy phase will take place--that will be a double-length phase, so 48 hours after the last player confirms, we'll see the first turn results.<br/><br/>It's an exciting time, all right, and fraught with uncertainty, since it's not unknown for a player to get second thoughts during this confirmation period. Failure to confirm kicks the game back into "waiting for players" mode, with all the anxiety-making that that suggests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280223/#Comment_280223" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T18:06:29+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  6:06PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone gets cold feet, I'll step into that gap.

With his prior solo victory, Jamey is the reigning champion and thus the player to beat, and he's playing one of the hardest countries on the board. Expect cagey, pragmatic play from this Diplomacy veteran!<br/></li><li><b>ENGLAND - Nathan / ndp.</b> 1 previous game, lost as Italy. Nathan is coming in with something to prove this game, having flubbed a promising position in an earlier game to spend time with friends and family in the real world. Still, the fact that he's back can only mean one thing: this time he's serious.<br/></li><li><b>FRANCE - Vincent / lumpley.</b> A newcomer to S-G Diplomacy but not to the Story-Games crowd, Vincent starts the game in control of a strong Power. Expectations are high for the designer of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> and <i>Apocalypse World</i>; will he live up to them? Stay tuned!<br/></li><li><b>ITALY - Brian.</b> 3 previous games; lost as Turkey and France, in the draw once as Turkey. Brian is a solid player, a capable diplomat and sound tactician. But he's got a string of losses behind him. Has he identified and remedied his Achilles heel? Time will tell!<br/></li><li><b>GERMANY - Russell / Aumpa.</b> No previous games. All eyes are on this complete unknown! Can he hang?<br/></li><li><b>RUSSIA - Eero.</b> 2 previous games; in the draw twice as France and Italy. Eero is a known quantity--known as a Mephistophelian mastermind, that is! Playing Russia, he's got an excuse to be up in <i>everybody's</i> business.  <br/></li><li><b>TURKEY - Chris / C. Edwards.</b> 1 previous game, lost as Italy. Chris is aggressive in pursuit of gain and tenacious in the face of loss; he will be a dangerous foe in this game. But as he himself recognizes, his immediate neighbors are the two strongest players in the game. What time do the fireworks start?<br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280317/#Comment_280317" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T08:35:30+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  8:35AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, the color commentary looks like it's going to be <i>fun</i> this time around!<br/><br/>You know, some places just call the big red dot in the middle a "bullseye".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280324/#Comment_280324" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T08:46:55+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  8:46AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I can see how Russia handles in the hands of a competent player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280349/#Comment_280349" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T10:33:36+00:00" title="July 13, 2010 10:33AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those introductions made me laugh.

The East got all of the known quantities in this game, which, in this case means it got all the people who've played multiple games and are thus regarded as experienced (at least locally).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280591/#Comment_280591" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T08:03:56+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  8:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm terrified of everyone!<br><br>-Vincent                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280600/#Comment_280600" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T08:31:11+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  8:31AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please join me in attacking France.

It begins!<br><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-1-O.png"/><br/><br/>Germany comes out of his corner swinging with a strong anti-'Russian opening! The fleet move to Denmark threatens to keep Eero out of Sweden, and the armies in Prussia and Silesia threaten Warsaw. England's opening is also strongly anti-Russian; expect a convoy to Norway supported by the other fleet. The French moves are temporizing, portending a rapid occupation of Iberia and an uncontested invasion of Belgium although one can imagine Germany sweating out the next 24 hours over Munich.  All in all, it looks like England and Germany have agreed to throw in together for a smash-and-grab against Russia, with France either a silent partner or a fly in the ointment.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Italy's fairly traditional deployment suggests a convoy to Tunis as his most conservative fall move, since Austria's heavily anti-Turkish opening promises a supported attack on Greece; no opportunities for the Italian here! But there are some tricky judgments to be made. Russia's moves show him gunning for Rumania, but T:Arm-Sev, Bul-Rum conceivably puts Russia down to 3 SCs if Warsaw falls. To the extent that Austria is counting on Russia's big guns against Turkey, he may opt to support Ukr-Rum so that there are Russian boots on the ground pointing toward Anatolia. That being the case, Turkey might roll the dice and support an Italian convoy into Greece, since the worst that could happen from his perspective is that Austria would be denied his second build. A Greek gambit that failed would leave Italy out in the cold, though, and failing to get that first-year build would be a powerful psychological drag on the Italian player as well as potentially a flag for France to come on down to where the water's warm. In any event, the maneuvering suggests that Italy and Austria are working toward some kind of modus vivendi if not outright cooperation against Turkey from the get-go. So you might see Austria using F Adr to support Italy into Greece while A Ser supports Russia into Rumania--although both Russia and Italy would put Austria on the list as second to go after Turkey, so there's a limit to how accommodating you can expect Austria to be to his nearby rivals.<br/><br/>Is it possible that Eero's reputation has caused his neophyte neighbors to gun for him in the early going? What arguments and expostulations can he deploy to forestall the deadly blow? Is the apparent Austro-Russian collusion similarly a product of the two board leaders getting each others' backs against a ravening horde of wannabes? Whose side is Italy on? Will France make an early break against his Western neighbors while they are marching eastward? The questions are many! Let the kibbitzing commence!                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>SG Diplomacy League, Game 4 - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12447/sg-diplomacy-league-game-4/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="SG Diplomacy League, Game 4 - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12447/sg-diplomacy-league-game-4/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I don't quite know if any arguments will help me now.

Or, better yet, Russell bottles and returns a part of his forces westward to defend his home S.Cs.

As it is, France is poised to pick up three builds, which will make him the 800 lb. gorilla in the room. What's going on? <br/><br/>The most likely possibility is that England and Germany are teaming up against Russia, and France is content to hold their coats ("Let's you and him fight") while he gobbles up uncontested neutrals. Germany has to be counting on a robust partnership with England, and to be imagining that his first-year builds will let him contend with France for the Low Countries.<br/><br/>Another strong possibility--and the thing that Jamey is worried about--is what's known as the "Western Triple," in which the three Western powers combine to take out Russia and Italy and then two of the three Western powers combine to knock out the third in a boardgame variation on The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. If that's the case, expect France to build fleets and send them at top speed into the Med.<br/><br/>Finally, it is <i>just barely</i> possible that Eero has convinced Russell to engage in an elaborate bit of theater whose point remains obscure. Spoiler! <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">Disguise an attack on England, maybe? If Russell orders Sil-Mun and bounces in Warsaw, and Eero orders GoB-Bal, then maybe that's what's happening. Keep it under your hat, though: we don't want to spoil the plan.</span>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>Geez, Bill, you've got me in bed with everybody but the Chinese!</blockquote>\nWhat are you trying to say, Jamey? That you're playing a game of Antagonism rather than Diplomacy? My point was that you're probably considering whether the obvious play (take Greece with everything) is the <i>correct</i> play, given that Turkey will probably stiff Russia on Rumania and that could lead to a very weak Russia and a very strong Turkey, along with a dangerous Western Triple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280887/#Comment_280887" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T10:24:48+00:00" title="July 15, 2010 10:24AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>Step 1:  Everyone move as far away from Switzerland as possible.</blockquote>\nIt's not our fault that Switzerland smells.

What is the relationship between France and the (apparent) Anglo-German partnership?  How long can France content itself with neutrals before coming to blows with its neighbors, or them coming to blows with France?<br>And what will Italy do next?

The Western Triple proceeds apace, while in the East the balance of power tips against Austria!<br/><br/><b>The Western Triple</b><br/><br/>In a sign of how much trust seems to exist between England and Germany, Nathan convoys Edi-Nwy with the fleet in the Norwegian Sea and supports the attack on Norway with the fleet in the North Sea. If there was any possibility of Germany stiffing England by ordering Den-Nth (cuts Nth S Edi-Nwy) to permit StP-Nwy to stand off the invasion from Scotland, Nathan probably would have inverted his orders, with the North Sea fleet doing the convoying and support coming from the Norwegian Sea.<br/><br/>The French fleet occupying the Spanish Riviera is positioned to strike toward Italy, and with both England and Germany busy mugging Russia, the decks are clear for a rapid French advance into the Med. What kind of reception awaits him there?<br/><br/><b>In the East</b><br/><br/>Italy and Turkey combine to stop Austria from picking up his second build in Greece. This is an interesting gambit on Italy's part, forgoing a move on Tunis (and thus a build) in order to influence events in the Balkans. Italy's northward march into Tyrolia puts pressure on Trieste, and so Austria has to consider how best to defend. Does he concentrate on defending Trieste, ceding Greece to the Turk? Does he make a play for the Ionian Sea, hoping to grab an unprotected Naples in the fall? Does he try for Greece again, knowing that Italy will probably want to grab Tunis before France gets within striking distance? A lot depends on the diplomatic interaction between Italy and Austria, and Italy's estimation of how far he can prosecute his attack on Austria before being forced to turn his attention to the West.<br/><br/>Turkey's maneuvering suggests that he prefers a hamstrung Russia to a mutilated one; Chris's withdrawal from Armenia only makes sense in the context of some kind of deal with Eero. But Russia's maneuvering points him at Turkey, since that fleet in Rumania is useless for attacking Austria--except that the Turkish fleet in the Black Sea acts as a disincentive to Russian adventurism. This suggests that Russia's maneuvering is primarily defensive. What kind of deal did Eero make with Chris? More to the point, what kind of deal did he make with <i>Jamey</i>?<br/><br/>The answers to these questions and more next turn as SG Diplomacy League Game 4 continues!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281061/#Comment_281061" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T07:48:42+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  7:48AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Aumpa</cite>Looks like Jamey and I forgot to tell Brian that Tyrolia was a demilitarized zone.</blockquote>\nHad I but known!

Four new armies just hit the board in the West! What's the deal with this mass conscription? <br/><br/>Does Nathan's placement of A Lon indicate that he's been promised Holland in the spring? Is France signaling his willingness to be a strictly continental power? Is Germany about to be left out in the cold, a veritable third wheel? Will Vincent's placement of armies in Brest and Marseilles instead of fleets convince his non-German neighbors that he's relatively innocuous? <br/><br/>In the spring, expect A Nwy to fight for Sweden while F Nwg heads east for coastal bombardment duties. There may be some sharp squabbling over Holland; Bel S Lon-Hol with F Nth in the convoy role is a possibility, although Lon-Nwy is more probable if England is supposed to get Sweden. <br/><br/>Is Germany beginning to regret his eastward lunge, or does he feel confident in the Western Triple?  Will A Mun head for Bur to bounce Par-Bur, or will Russell lend it to Austria to punish Italy's Tyrolian excursion?<br/><br/>Austria's tight spot is mitigated somewhat by his canny placement of an army in Vienna; expect A Bud and A Vie to work together to deny Trieste to Italy while Austria's southern forces make a play for Greece. <br/><br/>Turkey's fleet build will enable him to deploy to the Aegean Sea while moving A Syr to Smyrna for a possible convoy to Greece in the fall--but if Austria's already there, he's going to be hard to kick out.<br/><br/>Russia has some defensive prospects but is in a tight spot; right now his biggest decision is whether it's worth it to contest Sweden for another turn, maneuver into the Baltic, or retreat eastward. <br/><br/>All in all, exciting prospects are ahead!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281232/#Comment_281232" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T02:50:28+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  2:50AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the end, can we vote on some awards?

The German army evacuates Poland in order to man the barricades in the West! A British expeditionary force lands in Holland, supported by France, which also sends its armies rushing toward the Rhine!<br/><br/>We can only imagine what led to this extraordinary falling out! Was it France's mass mobilization? Was it the culmination of a deception plan cooked up by Eero and Russell before the game began? Or something else entirely?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Italy thinks twice about an assault on Austria, preferring to seize Tunis and close off the French frontier; in the fall he can stand himself off in Venice to ward off any Austrian probe from Trieste and then take his build. France's retreat from the Med must be particularly welcome, since it presages a French commitment to war in the north.<br/><br/>For his part, Austria balances caution with aggressiveness, forcing his way into Greece but securing Trieste.<br/><br/>Russia maneuvers defensively in the south, leaving Rumania open. It's clear that this withdrawal surprised Turkey, who was prepared for an assault on Bulgaria. Is this a trust-building measure on Eero's part, or merely a forced economy necessitated by the need to defend Moscow against the potential that Germany would continue to be enticed by the Drang Nach Osten?<br/><br/>Look for Austria and Turkey to continue to square off in the Balkans, perhaps over Rumania. Italy has to wonder where his 5th SC is going to come from; anticipate a potential Lepanto to shape up in 1903. Look for England and France to wrangle with Germany and Russia; that battle will go to the side that makes fewer tactical missteps.<br/><br/>All in all, a satisfying turn!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281432/#Comment_281432" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T09:17:39+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  9:17AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conversation with my girlfriend (a sometime-Diplomacy player herself), while checking the state of the game in a BoltBus (wi-fi!) on our way home from NYC:<br/><br/><b>Brian:</b> Man, being Italy sucks, You have to kiss everybody's ass.<br/><b>Wendy:</b> You have to kiss it before you can kick it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281439/#Comment_281439" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T10:00:49+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 10:00AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, I have yet to feel the touch of your sweet lips on my man-trunk.

Next year Vincent can make 2-unit attacks on either Munich or Holland, risking Ruhr if he guesses wrong. <b>Germany</b> goes up one to 6 SCs. But it looks like he's going to need A Sil to stand off A Mos indefinitely, so if he wants to defend with complete certainty, he'll have to build another army. Add in the fact that F Den probably isn't going anywhere in the near future, and you come to the conclusion that we may be looking at a <i>Sitzkreig</i> along the Western front until and unless Russia is able to bring his forces to bear in the north. But if Germany builds a fleet, it means he's worked something out with Russia. <b>Italy</b> gets Tunis and goes up one to 4 SCs; expect Fleet Naples to sail in the spring! <b>Russia</b> loses one but gains two for a net gain of one, putting him at 5 SCs. Eero has yet to weigh in on the fight between Austria and Turkey, but the fleet in Sevastopol may be able to decide the fate of Rumania. And even though it looks like Eero expected to bounce Chris out of it this turn, that sort of low-key deception is exactly Eero's stock in trade. Finally, <b>Turkey</b> loses one and gets one, for a net of zero, holding steady at 4 SCs. The Austrian army in Bulgaria has got to be a big concern for Chris, and the situation in the Balkans is unlikely to stabilize for a while.<br/><br/>But the game isn't just about materiel; it's also about position. In fact, one might say it's about position, position, position! I'm throwing the floor open! Who wants to speculate about who's got the best prospects for attack come Spring 1903?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281498/#Comment_281498" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T15:46:30+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  3:46PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Aumpa</cite>Is this what we'd call the beginning of the middle game now, since all of the SCs are occupied?<br/>For a player on a winning track, what's a typical growth rate during the middle game?

Rather, you grow in terms of stable territory and defensive synergy, and perhaps diplomatic clout (although that last one is debatable). Merely taking SCs is meaningless when those centers and units are situated in ways that do not improve your overall defensive synergy. The real goal in taking territory is to build one of the many stable configurations of SCs on the map, one that allows you to vacate a part of your possessions because units elsewhere keep the enemy out. This is the strength of the Turkish beginning position: it's one of the few that is perfectly defensible with less than the starting units. Of course adding to the three beginning SCs is a problem for Turkey, any SCs close by tend to be hotly contested and difficult to defend.<br/><br/>Warsaw is actually a basic example of a "dead" SC gain for Germany in the early game: there is no way for Germany to take Warsaw and then vacate it, taking benefit from the gain. In actual truth Germany needs to occupy the place long into the middle-game, practically until he also has Moscow, before he can take any material advantage from the place. The actual power from taking a SC would be the ability to direct more units into wars, but in the case of Warsaw for Germany this ability is very limited: it's one more unit, but that unit is stuck defending Warsaw and doing little else, with the only exception being a war for Moscow, in which the unit in Warsaw will be able to help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281550/#Comment_281550" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T04:49:44+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  4:49AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>How did Eero get Nathan to fall for the old, "I'll support you into Denmark" ploy?</blockquote>\nUm, didn't know it was a ploy!

England leaps back across the sea into Holland, supported by France! But Russell cedes Holland in order to retake Ruhr, putting Vincent\u2019s A Ruh in der Kessel. But the destruction of Army Ruhr may be a Pyrrhic victory for Russell, since Germany isn\u2019t in a position to make any offsetting SC gains and in fact looks like he\u2019s likely to lose Warsaw in the fall as well, unless Eero is unwilling to deprive his ostensible ally of materiel at a crucial juncture. The loss of those centers will make it correspondingly harder to defend his remaining four, although he may be able to convince Eero that he\u2019ll make a dandy shield against the Western allies for the time being. But Eero has been burned before when he\u2019s backed the wrong horse in a proxy fight, and he may be quicker to cut his losses this time.<br/><br/>Eero seems to have expected Gal-Ukr and hoped to create a chain of defensive bounces from Norway to Ukr that would have defended from opportunistic sniping along his northern coast. Luckily, Nathan decided to retrench; now he\u2019s set up for an attack on Norway. Expect Russia to contest such an attack. One happy side-effect of the success of Mos-Ukr is that it puts pressure on Rumania, now held by Austria. Expect a sharp fight for Rumania in the fall.<br/><br/>Austria and Italy scrapped over Trieste, which Jamey held. But Brian cruised into the Ionian Sea. Now he\u2019s in a position to sail into the Adriatic and add force to his siege of Trieste. With the withdrawal of the French Navy from the Med once again, he's also free to move east from Tunis.<br/><br/>Having that Turkish army in Serbia, surrounded by Austrian forces, probably makes Chris feel like World War I French general Ferdinand Foch, who famously reported to his higher headquarters, \u201cHard pressed on my right. My center is yielding. Impossible to maneuver. Situation excellent. I attack!\u201d Otherwise, Chris is holding the line; he stood himself off in Constantinople to keep his fleets in position, and let that army in Smyrna continue in reserve. These are signs that he\u2019s suspicious of both his neighbors. But look for Russo-Turkish cooperation in the fall.<br/><br/>For his part, Jamey has good defensive prospects but some tough decisions to make. Does he defend Greece? Defend Rumania? Contest Italian entry into the Adriatic? Expect some concessions to Russia in order to win his goodwill going forward--but maybe Jamey don't play like that. I can almost hear him now: "Concessions? Pfaw! Concessions are for losers!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281916/#Comment_281916" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T13:20:56+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  1:20PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeez, I feel like I'm playing Austria here, or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281917/#Comment_281917" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T13:21:58+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  1:21PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sehr lustig!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282287/#Comment_282287" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T00:18:00+00:00" title="July 22, 2010 12:18AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 12:56AM by Bill_White.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fall, 1903: France Goes South!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-5-R.png"/><br/><br/><b>Austria</b> gets Rumania and gives up Greece, holding steady at 6 SCs. It looks like Jamey was willing to concede Rumania to Russia and the Adriatic to Italy in order to secure his Italian flank. But with France's southern offensive pointing like a lance at Italy's heart, Austria's immediate prospects brighten considerably! Jamey might be able to leverage the presence of French troops in Piedmont to lighten his defensive load; e.g., order Vie S Tri, Tri hold and hope that Pie-Ven or Pie-Tyr cuts the Italian attack's second support rather than fills in behind a successful attack. Better yet for Jamey, maybe Brian calls off the siege to defend his homeland. <br/><br/>By holding tight this turn, <b>England</b> goes up 1 SC to 4, at Germany's expense. The English attack on Norway fizzles thanks to German intervention. Notice that Nathan could have stood off the Russian in Norway by ordering Nth-Nwy, Nwg S Nth-Nwy; the stand-off would have then resulted in a bounce in the North Sea. However, a <i>successful</i> attack on Norway would have left the North Sea wide open for that German fleet to sail into, putting not only the Home Isles at risk but also England's gain in Holland. Nathan rightly concluded it was too risky. <br/><br/>(I'd argue that Bar-Nwg last turn was probably not as helpful as Bar-Nwy would have been; sure that fleet would have been kicked out of Norway this turn, but right now it could have been retreating to Ska, setting up an attack on Denmark in the spring. Of course, a lot can go wrong with that sort of infighting; the wrong set of orders would scuttle F Ska as well as risk A Hol. But as it is, England is losing momentum. Where is his <i>next</i> SC coming from?)<br/><br/><b>France</b> commits to a southern offensive (Vincent's holding steady at 6 SCs, by the way), this time with quite favorable prospects. In the spring, Spa-NAf, Wes C Spa-Naf will put the French Foreign Legion in Tunis by the fall unless Italy orders Adr-Ion, Ion-Tun--and even then Austria might be persuaded to launch a spoiling attack from Albania. The Western front, on the other hand, looks like it will remain fairly static unless Germany disbands A Ruh.<br/><br/>The fall of Warsaw as predicted puts <b>Germany</b> down 2 SCs to 4. Expect A Boh and either A Ber or A Ruh to demobilize on their own recognizance as their quartermasters shrug embarrassedly at their empty pay sacks. I bet Eero will have suggested to Russell that Russia reclaiming Warsaw is a good thing for Germany, as it will permit the construction of an Atlantic fleet to put pressure on England. If Russell buys it, then the dismantling of A Ber and the subsequent construction of a fleet on the north coast of St. Petersburg signal intentions toward continued Russo-German cooperation. If that's the case, then Russell will be spending the next little while basically just <i>hanging on</i> until developments elsewhere change his prospects for good or ill. <br/><br/><b>Italy</b> can't be happy right now, looking at the board with his 4 SCs. The siege of Trieste has bogged down, and French forces lurk in the west. Italy's best bet is to jump up and down on the table screaming about the prospects for a French solo, make peace with Austria, and order Adr-Ion, Ion-Tun, Tyr-Ven, Ven-Tus, encouraging Jamey to order Vie-Tyr to prevent Pie-Tyr (with its implications for the fall of Germany). Of course, should that Viennese army actually make it to Tyrolia, the odds of Brian holding on to Venice for any length of time drop dramatically. So maybe he should just do the screaming and then attack Trieste anyway--but Jamey will probably expect that, so Brian is pretty close to screwed.<br/><br/><b>Russia</b>, on the other hand, probably feels pretty good. He's up to 6 SCs from 5 and has pretty good prospects. In the north, a fleet build lets him take the offensive against England. In the center, Germany is sufficiently hard-pressed that he won't be undertaking any more eastern front adventures. In the south, he's got a line on Rumania, which he may have billed as the price for cooperating with Austria against Turkey. Ironically, though, the French attack <i>hurts</i> Eero a little bit, in that it relieves some of the pressure Jamey was feeling and so makes Austria less tractable.<br/><br/>That gives <b>Turkey</b> an opening to revive negotiations with Eero, holding steady at 4 SCs having left Rumania to walk through Serbia into Greece. He needs one of his neighbors on his side if he's going to hold Greece and take back Bulgaria next turn. Of course, maybe Chris would prefer to bury the hatchet with Jamey in order to oppose Russia's northerly encroachment, but the entanglement of red and yellow in the Balkans has probably made it hard for those two to trust one another.<br/><br/>Big developments are brewing!

As expected, France invaded North Africa in preparation for an assault on Tunis, while Italy maneuvered its fleets to defend its sole colonial possession. But France rebuilt a fleet in Marseilles over the winter and now the situation has some drama: Brian will probably order I:TyS-Tun, I:Ion S TyS-Tun expecting to stand off F:NAf-Tun, F:Wes S NAf-Tun, with F:GoL-TyS bouncing because of the stand-off. But if Vincent orders F:Wes S GoL-TyS, then the Italian fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea makes it to Tunis, but the French will have encircled Tunis, enabling a 3 on 2 attack in the fall. Additionally, the French will threaten Rome and Naples. The danger is particularly acute for Rome if Vincent withdraws his Army Piedmont (displaced by an Italian attack) to Tuscany rather than Marseilles. This will give him an attack on Rome that can only be countered by ceding Tunis.<br/><br/>Of course, Vincent has own problems. Nathan has sent his English fleets chugging south into the English Channel, where he'll be able to convoy A Lon into Bre in the fall and pick up an easy build. And the only French units nearby are tied up defending against Germany. Russell defended the Ruhr with his entire army this turn, which means that he wasn't sure if Nathan would  in fact defect from his entente with France this turn--but he didn't attack into the North Sea from Denmark, either, which means he knew the defection was coming. We could see an all-out assault on France in the fall, with a landing in Brest accompanied by a push from the east intended to seize Belgium for England, with Germany getting Holland out of the deal. <br/><br/>In Russia, Eero has meanwhile decided that Germany makes a fine wall. Having retrieved Warsaw and persuaded Russell of the foolishness of Russo-German conflict so early in the game, he maneuvered in Scandinavia to position his fleets forward; expect Swe-Ska, Fin-Swe in the fall unless Eero decides to let the assault on France play out for a time. He also maneuvered to be able to force Rumania in the fall.<br/><br/>Jamey and Chris fought over Bulgaria and Chris won because Jamey expected Brian to resist his effort to sail into the Adriatic and so used F Alb to support Tri-Adr instead of using it to cut T:Gre S Con-Bul. Similarly, he supported A Bud into Trieste with A Vie despite an absence of Italian opposition. This suggests that Jamey was unaware of Italian intentions. This is striking; was Brian just incredibly cagey in his dealings with Austria, or did he receive assurances from Russia and/or Turkey that he should concentrate on France while they dealt with Austria? Does that explain the Italian assault on Piedmont, which otherwise seems risky? If Brian knew that Nathan's defection was in the offing, he might have calculated that Vincent will be more likely to retreat to Marseilles than to Tuscany.<br/><br/>Look for big doings in the fall!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282802/#Comment_282802" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-25T10:52:35+00:00" title="July 25, 2010 10:52AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2010 10:53AM by Bill_White.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fall 1904: Big Doings Indeed!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-7-R.png"/><br/><br/>England's failure to submit orders puts Nathan's troops in "civil unrest": everything holds! This is a <i>big break</i> for France, who should have lost Brest. When Nathan gets back from the wedding, he'll be non-plussed at best to see that he's been kicked off the continent once more, and that France is still holding on to Belgium (that he was supposed to take) while Germany stuck to the script and grabbed Holland from him. But Russell is also discommoded, albeit somewhat less so; England's NMR (No Moves Received, that is) leaves Germany's army west of the Rhine with its flank exposed, though maybe Russell will build an army in Munich and support A Bur from there. Some re-negotiation of the attack plan is in order; Germany can pick up Belgium in the spring himself and probably hold it, but England should probably refrain from attacking Bre, since a bounce in Brest (from F:Par-Bre) denies opportunistic grabs in both Brest and Paris. On the other hand, what does Nathan care about Paris? <br/><br/>Italy is getting pummeled from both sides now. Tunis held, but the French Navy kicked him out of the Tyrrhenian Sea; Brian will probably retreat to Naples from there and to Rome from Venice, where Austria has begun to make inroads. In the spring, nothing can stop Tunis from going under, and then a little coordination between France and Austria will put paid to Rome and Naples. Brian's big decision over the next 24 hours will be which unit to disband: A Pie or F Ion? My money's on A Pie.<br/><br/>The big news in the Balkans is Turkey's support of the Austrian army in Rumania against an all-out Russian assault, causing it to fail. A diplomatic sea-change or mere monkey-wrenching on Chris's part? An Austro-Turkish combination with Italy in disarray is enough to make even the savviest Russian player blanch. Luckily for Eero, however, Jamey's Italian gains are offset by his Balkan losses, and he can hope that Chris harbors sufficient mistrust about Austrian intentions to continue to play defensively.<br/><br/>In the north, Eero did send a fleet to patrol the Skaggerack, maybe in order to pick up Denmark in the spring; more likely, to push into the North Sea with Danish help in the spring and then convoy into England next fall. It could still happen, especially if Nathan doesn't get back soon and start submitting orders.<br/><br/>Very exciting! <b>Austria</b> holds steady at 6 SCs, losing in the east but gaining in the west. <b>England</b> loses one, going down to 3 SCs when he could have been up to 5. His offensive prospects look dim, but Germany and Russia may offer concessions in order to keep him on side. <b>France</b> holds steady at 6 SCs, and looks to stay that way next year (get Tunis, give Belgium). The year after that, he should pick up at least one southern Italian city, though. <b>Germany</b> goes up up to 5 SCs, and looks like he's got some offensive prospects for 1905. <b>Italy</b> ends the year in possession of 3 SCs, one of which is a goner next year and the other two of which are at risk in 1906. <b>Russia</b> holds steady at 6 SCs and is clearly squaring off against Austria. But England's fecklessness, Turkey's caution, and Italy's all-but-defeat on the battlefield have tilted the playing field against him. Finally, <b>Turkey</b> goes up one for a total of 5 SCs. He now has to decide whether to push against Russia (anticipate an army in Ankara) or into the Mediterranean (see ships in Smyrna).<br/><br/>The game goes on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282805/#Comment_282805" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-25T11:02:18+00:00" title="July 25, 2010 11:02AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282806/#Comment_282806" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-25T11:22:57+00:00" title="July 25, 2010 11:22AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bad Prime Minister.

I should stipulate that I'm not saying that Vincent should be sanguine about what's going on in the Ile de France, just that things could have been ten times worse. On the other hand, Nathan's psychopathological inability to attack his friend Vincent may prove to be France's secret weapon. Maybe now that Nathan is away from Vincent's Rasputin-like charisma, he'll come out swinging. The bottom line is that Nathan is not really positioned to attack anyone else, and Russell is already committed to the attack. Prognosis: hard fighting in France.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Piers</cite>Germany really does have to worry about Denmark--more than I think Bill is making out.

The one thing you can count on Eero to do is follow where his troops are pointing, and right now they're pointing at Denmark. And it's not like Russell can just turn on a dime and strike back at Russia; that would leave France and England at his back--essentially where this fight started. My bet is that Eero and Russell have already worked out the change of ownership. Russell may feel like Lando Calrissian, though: "This deal is getting worse and worse all the time."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Piers</cite>The Balkans is messy, but for my money the most fun that can be had right now is by Italy going all out and retreating A Venice to the Tyrol.

Or did Vincent trade away a piece of France in order to secure Nathan's help?<br/><br/>With Marseilles unthreatened thanks to A Pie's disband, Vincent storms into Burgundy, but Russell ducks and weaves and seizes Belgium--but leaves Munich wide open. If Nathan is really on Vincent's side, Nth-Hol cuts Hol S Bel, which lets Pic-Bel, Bur S Pic-Bel win if A Ruh covers Munich. Russell has to read Vincent's mind to figure out how to maneuver his armies next turn.<br/><br/>Russell has another problem. He decided he wasn't giving up Denmark after all, and stiffed Eero by ordering Kie S Den. He's got to do it again in the fall, which gives Eero a chance to maneuver; Swe-Bal, Ska-Swe keeps up the pressure on Denmark while threatening Berlin and Kiel. An army built in Warsaw could result in the fall of Berlin in 1906 if Russell can't hold on to Belgium.<br/><br/>Brian doesn't contest Vincent's conquest of Tunis, instead pushing into the Tyrrhenian from the Ionian. The ironic consequence of Brian's naval victory is that Vincent can retreat into Naples. It looks like he plans to take it back with TyS-Nap, Rom S TyS-Nap, but there's nothing stopping Jamey from ordering Ven-Rom to cut the support. On the other hand, why would Jamey want to help Vincent? He'd probably prefer to use A Ven to stand off A Ser Trieste, thus preventing Tyr-Tri.  Maybe Brian can try to grab Munich, either standing off Bur-Mun or getting it and thereby denying it to France. Of course, that helps Russell but not Brian, long-term.<br/><br/>Jamey taps the Ionian Sea, maybe to cut a possible Ion S Gre-Alb, and finds himself in possession of that crucial body of water. But he's got to worry about Budapest and Serbia. Vie S Bud keeps that city safe, and Ion-Gre, Alb S Ion-Gre might sacrifice the Ionian in order to cut Gre S Bul-Ser. <br/><br/>Eero's pointing at Denmark and Budapest; expect attacks in that direction unless he decides that Chris in possession of Serbia and the Ionian is too formidable, in which case maybe he'll slide into Armenia and build a fleet in Sevastopol.<br/><br/>Chris has to decide how to keep the pressure on Jamey and whether Eero needs to be taken down a peg or two. I'd expect him to try to convince Jamey to help him into Rumania, but failing that Eas-Ion, Gre hold, Aeg S Gre, Bul-Ser, Bla-Bul.<br/><br/>The stakes are high next turn! Some real property is looking to change hands!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283196/#Comment_283196" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T21:34:07+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  9:34PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must apologize.

NMR! Is he telling the truth, or was his all-forces-hold strategy part of a complex deception plan intended to make it look like Russia and Germany are falling out with each other? Watch the fleet retreat! Den-Hel bodes no good for England, whereas Den disband suggests a desire to rectify a mistaken fleet build. Den-Bal on the other hand, is convincing . . . but Russia's two builds represent a power-up for Eero that dramatically changes the situation. If he builds fleets in Sevastopol and St. Petersburg, then he intends to carry on against England and Turkey; army builds suggest intentions against Germany and Austria.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, France takes the pressure off Italy to shore up his home defense; he's got the juice now to take back Brest in the spring . . . but he has to disband a unit before then. Assuming that Vincent needs to keep three units bearing on Brest, he can choose Bur, TyS, or Tun. I like how disband TyS leaves Beau Geste and the rest of the French Foreign Legion stuck in Algeria, a forlorn hope now cut off from their retreating brethren.<br/><br/>But Vincent really wanted TyS; he even convinced Jamey to support GoL-TyS from the Ionian Sea. Chris's spoiling attack from Eas cut that support, of course, but it's the intention that counts. <br/><br/>The Austrian is being similarly squeezed; he'll have to disband a unit as well, but unlike Vincent he doesn't have many good options. The one thing he might do is assume that Brian will disband A Tyr and so feel safe to similarly demobilize A Ven, since the fleet in Rome can't sail across the Apennines. But what if Brian throws the dice and leaves A Tyr on the ground, hoping that both F:F Tys and A:A Ven go away? Jamey has enough problems; maybe he'll just disband F Ion in order to get a shot at Greece (though he'll need Russian help to get it).<br/><br/>Chris has been playing defensively but anti-Austrian; his withdrawal from Bla and Eero's simultaneous move to Armenia portend suggest that Eero is putting the pressure on Turkey as well. I'm not sure what that portends for events next year.<br/><br/>In Italy, Brian's ambit is much reduced. He'll end the year with fleets in Naples and Rome, a regular Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. But he must feel fortunate in his enemies.<br/><br/>The situation at the end of 1905:<br/><br/><b>Austria</b> goes down one SC to 5, giving up Rumania to Russia.<br/><b>England</b> goes up one SC to 4, getting Brest from France.<br/><b>France</b> goes down one SC to 5, giving up Belgium to Germany and Brest to England but getting Tunis from Italy.<br/><b>Germany</b> holds steady at 5 SC, giving up Denmark to Russia but getting Belgium.<br/><b>Italy</b> goes down one SC to 2, giving up Tunis to France.<br/><b>Russia</b> goes up two SC to 8, getting Denmark from Germany and Rumania from Austria.<br/><b>Turkey</b> holds steady at 5 SC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283771/#Comment_283771" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T21:25:37+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  9:25PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spring, 1906: Fierce Fighting!

(Delenda Est Italia!)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-11-R.png"/><br/><br/>Brian didn't stand a chance! Jamey agreed to give Vincent a piece of the Italian peninsula, and he leaped at the opening, charging in from the Tyrrhenian to take Rome. Meanwhile, Brian's last-ditch attempt to grab an Austrian SC hadn't a forlorn hope in hell, as Jamey covered Vienna from Budapest and stood himself off in Trieste from Albania and Venice.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Eero supported Jamey's army in Serbia against a Turkish attack so that the Turkish SC loss caused by his own attack on Ankara wouldn't be offset by Turkish gains elsewhere. Interestingly, Chris didn't bother to defend Ankara; instead, he moved Con-Smy, Eas-Ion. What could he have been thinking?  I think Eero must have lied to him: "Keep attacking Austria; I'll help you. What, those fleets? Pay them no mind; they are a mere ruse, intended to convince Austria I'm on his side, not yours. Next year we'll ferry them through the Bosporus and they'll go fight France."<br/><br/>In the north, Eero was not as successful, however. Piers, taking over as Germany from Russell, must have negotiated an at-least-temporary truce with Vincent to secure the Western front, enabling him to hold off the Russian forces charging toward Berlin. At the same time, Nathan's fleet in the North Sea joined with the German fleet in Denmark to stave off a Russian reconquest of that territory.<br/><br/>Nathan develops a new plan of attack.

The attack was not a certainty, and it failed. Whether Jamey would have turned on me anyway is an academic question, but I chose a poor moment to try and break out. <br/><br/>I'm not sure I should have gone after France. Even in retrospect, I can't quite see a moment when it would have worked out. Italy vs France in the early game is a daunting challenge.<br/><br/>Eero claims my next-to-last disband was a bad decision, but I think my doom was already sealed at that point, as Jamey and Vincent's agreement over my fate was solid. And while neither of them is running away with the game, I think they're both in stronger positions than they would have been if they hadn't turned on me. Possibly. Hard to say. <br/><br/>Jamey might have been in a position of longer-term strength if he'd concentrated on Turkey instead of Italy, but I didn't seriously try to help him do that, which may have been unwise of me. Then again, he may end up going to war with Russia with three Italian SCs bolstering his forces, and no France in sight.<br/><br/>Vincent's turn on me clearly convinced his northern opponents to come after him, but if he manages to stave them off and regain the upper hand while keeping Tunis and Rome, history will vindicate his decision to head south when the northern goings-on got boggy.<br/><br/>Once my strategy became "I hope my enemies' enemies work faster!", I was in real trouble.<br/><br/>(Although THAT strategy might have turned out differently but for the English NMR. I look forward to learning whether or not that was a ruse once this game ends.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283928/#Comment_283928" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T14:05:38+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  2:05PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent is a tough nut diplomatically, and Italy is all but doomed if France cannot be swayed.

I suppose that the next game starts whenever this one ends, at which point we'll give new players an opportunity to step up and fill the rest of the seats with whoever among the veterans wants another round.<br/><br/>Finding out about the next game is somewhat tricky in practice, as you have to notice the next new Diplomacy thread on the forum within the narrow window of couple of days before the game fills up. I can't think of any way to make it more easily noticeable, though. I guess we could send private messages to people who've expressed interest to make sure they notice the new game when it's starting, or something like that.<br/><br/>I could also brag about how this game's going to be in the bag before the month is out, but that would not be prudent. Just check back on this game, and when the number of players has whittled down to 3-4, that's when you know that it's likely just a week or two from finishing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284036/#Comment_284036" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T15:48:18+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  3:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet thanks.

What can the diplomacy possibly be like that would have Jamey and Chris continue to jab away at each other like knife fighters while Eero creeps up on them like a gigantic and not-really-all-that-stealthy grizzly bear? It smacks of desperate, punch-drunk game-fatigue, is what it does. Chris, outmaneuvered in his home SCs, may be doing a sort of reverse-janissary, Ottoman soldiers serving a Christian monarch in exchange for more turns of life and place in the draw if Eero can't pull off the solo. Riding the tiger, Eero calls it. In contrast, the logic of Jamey's maneuvering in Austria seems straightforward: he'll let Russia gobble up Anatolia while he secures his position in Italy, trusting that he can win the fight for the Balkans while Russia deals with his northern rivals. However, the history of Franco-Austrian cooperation suggests that there's more to the picture; if Austria refrains from taking Rome in favor of pushing southeast to help eliminate Turkey, then it's possible that Jamey's plan is to let Russia do the heavy lifting against the Turkish homelands while he grabs what he can, allowing France to deal with that damned elusive English pimpernel that's been raiding up and down the Atlantic coast--if that's in fact what he's been doing.<br/><br/>In other words, the Austrian fleet build may be a sort of misdirection, or at the very least a placatory gesture toward Russia. Similarly, the French army build may have been a concession to Austria--a signal that the cooperation thus far demonstrated is to continue.<br/><br/>Let us see what the fall brings!

Eero cedes the Skaggerak without a fight, hoping perhaps to lure an English fleet to its doom and in any event positioning for a possible flanking move into the Norwegian Sea. Meanwhile, Eero's Cossacks wheel and gallop southeast across the Central European plains, linking up with the Russian army entrenched in Rumania. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jamey imagined that his deal with Vincent held good and that Eero was preoccupied in Germany, so he maneuvered against Turkey, pushing Chris's fleet out of the Ionian from Naples, covering Budapest against a possible Russian incursion out of Rumania from Vienna, and tapping Bulgaria with Serbia to take advantage of any Turkish effort to defend Constantinople. But Chris's reverse-janissaries bloody Jamey's nose in Serbia, although he failed to slip his Ionian Sea raiders past the squadron guarding Naples. And Constantinople, undefended, fell to the Russian navy.<br/><br/>Watch Turkey's retreat from the Ionian Sea: if he sails eastward, it means he's planning on defending Smyrna; if he lands in Apulia, it means he's still got a mad-on for Austria.<br/><br/>Vincent is on board with the plan to deal with Russia; it looks like he's ceding Iberia to England to get more fleets in the fray up north while his armies march under Switzerland. The fleet in Rome was supposed to take up station in the Tyrrhenian, perhaps for convoy duty in the fall, but Turkish naval raids kept it busy. Now it seems possible that Vincent will grab Venice and Naples while Jamey's back is turned. <br/><br/>Eero is counting on his withdrawal from the precincts of Berlin to make Piers breathe a sigh of relief and turn his attention westward, but Piers may find himself forced to take the same road Russell took at the beginning of the game. He can grab the Baltic Sea and chase the Russian armies into Poland, but at the cost of leaving rear areas undefended in the West; would Nathan and Vincent be able to stop themselves from grabbing while the grabbing is good, even if it meant that Russia's position would be strengthened? It's hard to tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284229/#Comment_284229" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T22:06:51+00:00" title="August  3, 2010 10:06PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Despite an institutional fondness for Turkey, I think I'm pulling for the new Anglo-Germanic alliance.

Germany seizes Sweden while maneuvering to defend against opportunistic French attacks that do not materialize (French units hold, probably a Gencon-related NMR). Russia meanwhile slips into the Norwegian Sea, and continues marching into the Balkans. Austria counterattacks against Turkey, seizing Serbia back while forestalling a Turkish raid on Venice.

He grabs Bulgaria from the Turk and sends his southern fleets into the Aegean. In the north, he bypasses the German hedgehog in Sweden in order to land in Clyde. Germany pushes past the English fleet in Skagerrack to bear down on Norway, which is now the tail end of Russia's northern pincer.<br/><br/>In the south, Austria seizes Greece, thus dooming Turkey, crushed between two implacable foes.

But Russia grabs Serbia from him, denying him a build, and France returns to action by sliding into Naples, sending Austria down one SC. France meanwhile sends his armies south, moving away from the German border. England remains inert as Russia takes Liverpool, and Germany pushes into the North Sea to contest the British Isles.<br/><br/>As the year ends, the SC count is Austria 4, England 4, France <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">6</span> 7, Germany 6, Russia <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">11</span> 13.<br/>It will take some extraordinary coordination and tactical cleverness on the part of the Western allies to stop a Russian victory, and while it seems like Germany has been the linchpin of the defense, he has little to hope for from his partners. It's not clear, for example, why France built an army in Paris rather than a fleet in Brest, but Germany can't be sanguine about the rationale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285150/#Comment_285150" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T09:01:56+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  9:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard not to picture Eero as The Emperor from Star Wars at this point, steepling his fingers and whispering "Excellent..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285164/#Comment_285164" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T09:40:26+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  9:40AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blarg.

But the real action is in the Med, where it looks like the plan was for Austria to spearhead the naval advance toward Anatolia via the Eastern Med. This despite France and Germany each grabbing one of the Austria's westernmost SCs last turn. We can only imagine the arm-twisting diplomacy that went down. "It's us," they must have said, "or a Russian solo. Suck it up."<br/><br/>But Jamey don't play that. Instead of pushing against Russia, the Austrian fleet in Greece reversed course and smashed into the French beachhead that its Ionian Sea compatriots had helped establish in Albania (supported by an ironically well-defended army in Trieste), and the one in the Ionian Sea snatched up an undefended Naples. Still down one SC over the year, he'll have to disband a unit, but now he may be the one saying, "It's me or a Russian solo. How do you like them apples?"<br/><br/>It's not clear how Austro-Russian diplomacy ramifies here; Eero seems to have given ear to Jamey's complaints and offered to straighten things out with Bud S Tri-Ven, but as we've seen the army in Trieste had business along the Adriatic coast. Otherwise, Eero played defensively in the south, perhaps waiting to see how things shook out. He must also be encouraging Vincent in a rather Darth Vaderly fashion to turn on his erstwhile ally Germany ("Together, we can rule the continent!"); in that light, his impossible orders "Bul(sc) S Bur-Mun" must be regarded as somewhat tongue-in-cheek, a form of hopeful cheerleading to remind Vincent of Piers's vulnerability.<br/><br/>Piers must be feeling the strain; he's running as fast as he can just to stay in place. Berlin is pressured, Munich is wide open, Vienna is there for the taking, and a misstep in Scandinavia could crack things wide open. Luckily, he will be able to build a unit to defend Munich, but he has to worry that Vincent will find Eero's logic persuasive. <br/><br/>Conversely, Vincent has been the prime beneficiary of England's fecklessness; if there is a draw, he will be in it, and to a great extent he will be able to determine whether that draw includes Austria and Germany. <br/><br/>But Eero is probably feeling extremely confident despite having been somewhat wrong-footed this turn. He has decent offensive prospects in Germany's home SCs in the coming year, and he'll be able to advance elsewhere. And though the Western allies seem to know the score, there seems to be sufficient scope for mistrust and bad blood among them to interfere with the smoothly coordinated defense necessary to prevent his victory. If Vincent misjudges the extent to which he can roll up his erstwhile allies while still forestalling a Russian solo, Eero will take away the solo win.<br/><br/>At year's end, <b>Austria</b> goes down one SC to 3; <b>France</b> goes up three to 10 (and will actually start the year with an unbuilt unit because of the destruction of A Alb);<br/><b>Germany</b> goes up one SC to 7; and <b>Russia</b> holds steady at 13 SCs.

Germany and Austria cede central Europe to the Russians, abandoning Trieste and Vienna. The maneuvering in Italy suggests that Austria's forces will be pressed into the line there, with France giving some or all of the Italian home SCs in fief to the Austrian player. All in all, it looks like a clear case of trading space for time.<br/><br/>The second half of the Allied plan requires closing the door on Russia's naval maneuvering in the northern seas. A combined Franco-German assault throws the Russians out of Edinburgh, but London falls to the Russian fleet that had been prowling around the coast of Wales. The fall will prove important if not decisive; Eero's retreat from Edinburgh may indicate if he plans to keep playing hide-and-seek around the British SCs or make a move on the North Sea.<br/><br/>At this point, the stakes are clear: the Western Allies have to establish themselves along a stalemate line that will enable them to deny a Russian solo victory. With Russia already active in the seas around England, this may not be as easy as it sounds. Even if they succeed militarily, each individual power in the alliance will have to calculate if reducing the size of the draw by turning on an erstwhile ally is practicable, a fact which in and of itself may destabilize the alliance (as we've seen). For its part, Russia has a good chance of winning by military action alone, so we can expect the game to continue at least until the front lines stabilize. If that happens before Russia gets the 18 SCs it needs to win, Eero will probably encourage France to turn on both Austria and Germany, since the result of such a turn would be either a smaller draw or even another shot at the solo win.<br/><br/>It's coming down to the wire, folks! Stakes are high, tensions are mounting, and mistakes will be fatal!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286303/#Comment_286303" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T08:46:41+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  8:46AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2010 8:47AM by Piers.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting to hear what seems to be going on from the outside.

Thanks to everybody who played; despite the rather strange mid-game events in Turkey this was a very interesting game for me; part of this was because I think this is the first time I've ever soloed in a postal game that run its course. In Diplomacy the standard victory is a three-way draw, soloes are rare things and all the more so in postal games that allow the opposition to think things through and break the momentum off any solo attack. I am very happy with the level of dedication and responsibility seen in the end-game here, even the minuscule Austrian government-in-exile sent in moves like a trooper up until the end.<br/><br/>Some notes on the game and performance from the Russian viewpoint:<br/><br/><b>Early game</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-1-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-1-O.png"/></a>The western Powers opened the game with a western triple alliance - a challenging move typical of American Diplomacy philosophy, and one that I've only seen once before in actual play. I didn't even know for sure that this was what we had in our hands before the fall moves. Entente or not, my own advice to Germany at the time was the same before and after the moves: a Russo-German war in the very early game is a horribly risky strategy for both parties, but especially for the offensive side, as a large number of units are committed to war against a non-conventional enemy; you're essentially taking away forces from other places to open up a war that you don't need to begin with. It takes a lot of trust to play this opening.<br/><br/>My diplomacy at the start worked fine with Germany and Austria, while everybody else was more or less lukewarm: Italy didn't see any point in windy talks, France and England were hostile in retrospect (I should've almost expected the northern opening from England from the way he communicated) and Turkey was strangely grumpy (this behaviour continued through the game). For my part I did not have any grand plan for the game to begin with, except for the idea that I wanted to try a northern opening: this is a risky move for Russia, but I'd been thinking about the early game tactics and diplomacy, and I liked some of the synergies present in the implications of Mos-StP.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-2-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-2-O.png"/></a>In the fall I lost Warsaw, which is a pretty hard blow on Russia at first; Russia is a giant with feet of clay, and she's usually unable to maintain her borders without offensive momentum, and unable to keep up offensive momentum on all borders even without this sort of setback. I had enough presence of mind at this point to realize that Germany was likely playing a western alliance game, which was why I didn't even try to bounce in Warsaw - in Diplomacy it is often a good idea to allow those things you cannot prevent happen as they would so as to not waste your forces on futile struggle and to make your opponent over-commit their forces in the same. My plan at this point was largely to sit tight and wait for the inevitable pressures to do their job: Germany would find it difficult to occupy Warsaw on a permanent basis due to the fact that he still had strong early-game empires on his western flank, and two armies in Warsaw are still a loss of material for Germany elsewhere.<br/><br/>Here we also see Turkey playing a fleet into the Black Sea for the first time. Now, I have to admit that I held a slight preference for anti-Turkish play from the very beginning of the game here, but that was just tactical, caused by my wish to not slip into a simple and expectable Juggernaut in the south. However, the way Chris played our relationship, my inclination soon blossomed into something of a dislike for the Sultan: he broke NMR, insisted on his peaceful intent and concocted paranoid scenarios of Russian plotting against him. I was already pretty thoroughly antagonized long years before I was ready and tactically willing to try for his throat.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-3-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-3-O.png"/></a>The spring 1902 was the diplomatic turning-point of the game in that Germany decided to play with me instead of against me. Russel and I had had some good discussions over the first days of the game, and apparently he decided that I was the more trustworthy option as an ally over the western Powers. The shift was quite dramatic and sudden, as can be seen on the map: Germany relinquished Warsaw and let me into Sweden even while England was preparing an attack on St. Petersburg. It is very easy to say in hindsight that Russia would have been dead if not for this turn; it'd be interesting to hear from England and France if they were really plotting to do Germany in next as I was speculating at the time. The French moves certainly seem somewhat ambivalent.<br/><br/>My own play this year was rather tactical in nature; I was just trying to preserve my skin. Italy was playing an interesting <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/12/03/diplomacy-the-italian-cha-cha/" rel="nofollow">Cha-cha</a> game as far as I could discern, while Turkey and Austria were doing an admirable job keeping each other out of Russia. A very common weakness of northern openings for Russia (and of losing Warsaw early) is that it tends to trigger a feeding frenzy in Russia's southern neighbours who know very well that they're the ones who deserve the lion's share of Russia's bulk for themselves. In this case the southerners were much more placid, however; I suspect that this was because Chris was not making any great diplomatic strides with Austria, either, and thus Jamey felt that he had to gear up against the Sultan.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-4-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-4-O.png"/></a>In the fall a lot of things happened: both Austria and Turkey took a bit of a shot against me, while I arranged to fuck up England beyond all recognition - a suitable revenge for his very anti-Russian play so far. The dual attack on Holland and Norway was arranged with Germany, as was the bounce in Warsaw, all executed beautifully. England dropped back to three SCs at this point, which took much of the steam out of his system. I also hear that Nathan tried to retreat to StP out of Norway, resulting in a disband, while he would've actually wanted to keep the army in Finland. A stroke of luck for me, that.<br/><br/>Overall the situation was once more rather grim for me: I was building out of Sweden and Norway despite the loss of Rumania, but Austria had also moved into Galicia while my southern front was all but empty. I was pretty active in diplomacy at this time, of course, trying to arrange for all seven sorts of difficulty for both Turkey and Austria. Especially an Italian attack on Austria's back was something I very much wanted to set up to bail me out of trouble.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-5-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20205-5-O.png"/></a>In 1903 I mostly rearranged my forces and brought material from the north to the south while allowing Turkey and Austria as much room as possible for fighting each other, which they admirably did. My German alliance was also going strong; Russel and I talked things over, and most of the time Russel found no fault in the advice I gave him on how to crush the westerners. Jamey in Austria was also a solid ally for me for a while at this point, while Chris in Turkey was grudgingly neutral. Just looking at the board, the game could have gone awfully wrong in the spring of 1903; it was solid diplomacy and knowing how the relations between the other players were developing that allowed me to sleep at night.<br/><br/>It was around this time that I started to seriously notice how very strangely Vincent was conducting his diplomacy as France: I think that I only ever got one message from him early on, so I stopped writing him around this time, too. For the rest of the game I gave him nothing and got nothing from him. A pretty hardcore stance, that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager

pressure on Russia was off, which allowed me to make some strategic plans with my comfortable 6 SCs. Germany was proving a good ally against a stiff western resistance, so I had no trouble working with him indefinitely, especially if I could talk Russel into giving me Denmark at some point. In the south I was playing a hard line: I was firmly in the Austrian camp against Turkey, as that's the way diplomacy was pointing, but I also wanted to have a solid position against Austria - it was obvious to us both that Austria would have to be my next target after Turkey, after all.<br/><br/>Italy met her doom at this point in time, as French and Austrian forces united to put him out of his misery. The Cha-cha did not serve him well, as it seemed to mostly annoy French and Austrian leadership sufficiently to amass the necessary forces against Brian. Might have been some flaw in diplomacy, or perhaps cha-cha is just not a very smart thing to do.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-9-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20205-9-O.png"/></a>After 1903 the game had slowed down considerably, excepting the Italian reduction going on in the mid-Mediterranean. In 1905 I used my love-hate relationship with Austria to my advantage to seize Rumania; I seem to remember that it was agreed that Rumania would have to belong to me, while we would use the seeming war between us to confuse Turkey further. Jamey was likely not happy at all with how the situation was developing, and he certainly skittered this way and that while waiting for the hammer in Galicia to drop. Chris apparently believed that I was fighting with Austria, and why not - I was, after all, no matter how diplomatically harmonious we were. My relationship with Jamey was very harmonious all through the game, in fact, as we discussed frankly the necessities of crushing each other.<br/><br/>The western front had been slowly grinding an advantage for Germany for a couple of years, and in 1905 we finally got England to join in against France as well. All seemed to be going well until the fall, when Germany NMR:ed. This was a pretty funny thing, as the plan was for him to bounce me in a false war up in Denmark; without his support Denmark fell to me completely unintentionally.<br/><br/>This was also the year when I finally got my southern front into order against Turkey. It was pretty funny that Chris, after acting paranoid through the whole game, finally believed in me enough to move out of the Black Sea only to find me in Armenia. That combined with the build I got from Rumania gave me a solid front against Turkey.<br/><br/><b>End-game</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-11-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20205-11-O.png"/></a>It was not immediately obvious in 1906 that we'd moved into the end-game, but the factors were all present already at this point from the Russian viewpoint: I couldn't get Russel to make a serious peace with me even as I outright promised him Denmark, which inspired me to send some armies his way to see if there would be any easy gains to be had; this war ultimately shaped out into the great end-game crunch. Meanwhile my Turkish assault began down south, and while nobody else could know it yet, Turkey had already started his suicide-by-Cossack which ultimately enabled me to overrun both Turkey and Austria, making me a fit candidate for a solo victory.<br/><br/>Regarding the Turkish play here at the end, I have to be very clear in that I still have no idea why Chris chose to suicide by fighting against Austria while letting me take his SCs. Maybe he just felt so very betrayed by Austria? All I got in 1906 was a short message chastising me for my choice, and then a final silence that lasted until the end of the game. Perhaps Chris might tell us what he was thinking here? I considered stopping the game more than once and even discussed this with Jamey, as Chris's actions were verging on collusion: as it was, I ended up just making a careful advance on him while making it very clear to everybody who asked that I had no clue whatsoever as to what was going on.<br/><br/>I'll write more about Piers in Germany, the Grand Alliance and the tactical niceties of the Russian triumph later separately. Although this latter half of the game dedicated to the end-game crunch was mostly strategic and tactical, it wasn't entirely devoid of diplomacy: first I got beaten by Germany several times due to my inability to believe that he was already completely dedicated to a western alliance, and then I turned the tables by talking Austria into aiding and abetting my rise to power. More on that later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290780/#Comment_290780" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T07:38:05+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  7:38AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2010 7:39AM by Brian_Minter.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got knocked out of this game so long ago I barely remember playing in it.

I ran low on energy about halfway through as life just kept getting busier and busier.<br/><br/>Eero, those are great synopses of the first half of the game, I want to hear the rest!<br/><br/>For me, there were essentially two turning points.  The early game was an exercise in near stasis, nobody seemed to be making significant gains, and I couldn't establish a solid war with anyone without getting nailed from behind.  Eventually I decided that a new equilibrium had to be established and thus: to make a permanent change, one must fall.  For vagaries of diplomacy now lost to antiquity, I chose Italy; Vincent and I agreed on a split, and we made it happen.<br/><br/>It seemed that I had alienated Turkey, however, and while I accepted that losses on my Eastern front were likely while I finalized Italy's demise, I wasn't expecting the whole-hearted, full-steam, single-minded assault that I was met with from Turkey.  From that point forward he made the most anti-Austrian moves he could, even to the point of leaving home SCs open to Russian forces.  That's where the shape of endgame was formed.<br/><br/>From there, it was a matter of seeing how much territory Eero would control.  I helped get the Grand Alliance going, but after England's surrender and with Eero's forked tongue in my ear, I became convinced that Vincent and Piers would assist in eradicating me so that they could secure the three way tie.  Thus, I saddled up the tiger and took him for a spin; thinking that there was at least a chance I could stay alive long enough and become stable enough to survive.<br/><br/>Alas, it was not to be.  A surprise German convoy into Mother Russia stood to create gains for the alliance, but a second unit sent in for support destabilized the home front and led to the eventual solo.<br/><br/>And that's all she wrote!

Jamey didn't get a happy ending this time, but that's just because theaters of war outside his control up north turned out unexpectedly well for me.<br/><br/><b>Grand Alliance and Me</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=12" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-12-R.png"/></a>In 1907 Piers took control of Germany. He quickly established an anti-Russian alliance with England and apparently France; I never had a good handle on the French play, as Vincent didn't talk to me - the moves seemed like he was giving up Spain to England voluntarily, which would've been a strong play if England proved a strong ally <i>and</i> I became a menace. At this point the threat of my solo was already able to be read from the board, as Turkey's back had been broken and Austria was tactically in a very difficult position regarding me: I was not officially in a war against Austria, but Jamey probably had even less illusions than I did about the course of events.<br/><br/>Piers played a very, very strong game against me from the beginning. He ruthlessly talked me out of attacking him with promises of cooperation in a situation where he was in hindsight clearly building up a Grand Alliance - an alliance of the remainder of the board against myself. This was a pretty far-seeing action in 1907, as even I myself was not entirely committed to making the last push at this time; I could have imagined just taking Turkey and establishing a fleet presence in Anatolia, then trying to talk Austria into a war against the west. As it happened, Turkey was consistent about throwing his SCs to me, which in combination with my withdrawal from the German border led me into such a good position against Austria that I had no reason to wait; once I started to engulf Austria the need for a Grand Alliance became technically obvious: Russia in possession of the entire Balkans and Anatolia is just a couple of SCs away from victory, and even with just the northern Austrian SCs in my possession it was soon tactically clear that Austria could not prevent me from claiming everything east of Venice.<br/><br/>England was still fully in the game at this point, which weakened the Alliance somewhat; although I couldn't make any particular headway in fracturing the allies after convincing England to attack France earlier, the mere presence of England on the backsides of France and Germany made the situation somewhat tense for them. England died out of commitment early into the end-game as it happened, changing the field entirely.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=13" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-13-R.png"/></a>In the fall of 1907 I'd made up my mind about attacking Austria while the Nordic fleet war got into a flying start. I don't think I knew what Germany was doing in Tyrolia at this time, but whether he had anti-Austrian ideas at first, it was soon pretty clear that his role would be to support the crumbling Austrian against me there just as he was cooperating against me with the Englishman up north. France NMR:ed here to relatively little effect in hindsight; his most important moves at the time would have just aggravated his western allies.<br/><br/>That northern fleet war was at the same time important and somewhat optional for Russia; at the beginning I was at a massive disadvantage with three units against the English and German fleets, and had England continued to play, I would have probably had to concede that front altogether (not a massive set-back; StP is a dead-end for western Powers, I could've just held onto it in a static defense while trying to make a break elsewhere). The strategic meaning of the war in the north was mostly in me trying to maintain my hold on a couple of Nordic SCs that'd make it easier for me to reach a majority of the board later on; there is a defensively oriented trench on the Calhamer board that runs from the Baltic through Switzerland to Tunis, making large offensives over it geographically challenging; by keeping hold of the Nordic SCs west of St. Petersburg I could reduce the need for fighting the intense battles required to seize the likes of Berlin or Venice or Tunis from the western Powers. At this point I basically had permanent claim on 14 SCs in Russia, Turkey, Austria and the Balkans, so keeping a couple of Nordic SCs (or English - no matter, really) while I extended my claim to Italy was necessary. At this time I didn't believe in my chances to breach the extremely defensible Mun-Ber line, so my hopes were mostly directed at rolling over the Med and taking Tunis, Naples and Rome to complement whatever I could keep up north.<br/><br/>At this point it was clear that I had nothing else to offer to Austria aside from a tiger ride. I did active and honest diplomacy towards Jamey, and while it took a while to take root, a couple of years later he would choose to vacate his difficult position in the Balkans area for the dubious safety of Italy. In hindsight it seems clear that France and Germany would have done their best to keep the faith and preserve Austria in a 4-way draw, had Jamey kept fighting me consistently. (Doing that would have been bad play on their part, objectively speaking, as a 4-way draw is a worse outcome than a 3-way; they'd have been fighting to lose, essentially. Perhaps this was why Jamey didn't believe them.) My own stance was rather clear, however: there would be no 4-way, they'd have to somehow manage to reduce my considerable empire into ruins before I'd even consider such a weak draw. The only route into a draw that I'd allow to Austria would be for him to support me in eliminating Germany, or for him to manage to deadlock me at 17 SCs with an unbreakable western defense. As I expressed this threat in those negotiations at the time: if I lost faith in my ability to take a solo, my very next act would be to sweep off Austria from the board, no matter the strategic cost on other fronts; losing SCs to Germany would be completely unimportant when and if I lost my soloing chance, as my next best option would be a 3-way draw, for which I would need do nothing but kill off Austria. I drummed this logic at Jamey consistently through the first years of the end-game in the hopes of getting him to see the light.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=14" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-14-R.png"/></a>1914 was Gencon time, both France and England NMR:ed. In hindsight this English NMR was probably the single most important strategic factor in my victory: I could have worked with a recalcitrant Austrian and a more efficient France all the way to the end, but I probably could not have survived a living and active England. Then again, having England around would've also meant more diplomatic pressure on the westerners, so it's distinctly possible that they would have had even more coordination problems than they had with two Powers in the Alliance.<br/><br/>This is a good moment to mention a strategic factor in France's overall play: Vincent often surprised me with suboptimal moves through the last eight years of play. I didn't really understand his play, perhaps, due to us not communicating through the game, but even accounting for this there were some very interesting choices he made especially regarding builds: France built a humongous amount of armies all through the game, consistently having an average of 1-2 armies too many, with an equivalent lack of fleet force. His immediate tactical moves on the front were generally solid, but I never felt that France was using all of her strength as efficiently as possible to counter me; often forces would take an extra year to get to the front, and when they did they might have gone to the "wrong" fronts and be the wrong type. More on this later.<br/><br/>In 1908 the Austrian fleet force was pretty credible down south, so it was not an inconceivable notion that he would keep me bottled up and defending the Aegean Sea for the rest of the game with French aid. I would've likely seized the Balkans regardless in time, but at this point I was definitely pouring the pressure on Jamey to turn back towards Italy. Tactical attrition helped, as the Austrian fleet force was mainly maintained by continental SCs that I was picking off one by one; in 1908 that fleet was enough to seriously threaten me in Anatolia, but a successful defense even for just a couple of years would see it reduced by necessity as I made gains in the Austrian homelands.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=16" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-16-R.png"/></a>The war with Germany was interesting at first in that we did not have a full trench in the Pru-Sil area, as is often the case in Russo-German wars. Rather, my armies were mostly fighting in Austria while a savage fleet war in the Nordic area took most of the German attentions. In 1909 I felt Piers's hand in the tactics of the board for the first time despite this relative lack of contact between our forces: in hindsight I have to say that he made heavy use of convoy tactics, often in ways that I did not fully consider myself due to the risks involved.<br/><br/>The two convoys this year were both strategically solid and tactically brilliant. In the south I was somewhat blindsided by my hopes regarding Austrian, waiting for him to turn towards Italy; my argument for why he should do it had been so powerful that I couldn't myself imagine that he wouldn't go for it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> The Austro-French convoy from Tunis to Albania brought much needed respite to the Austrian forces in the area, providing Trieste in particular with sidelines support that would be very difficult for me to oust quickly. An unfortunate side-effect of this western offensive was that Germany and France seized Vienna and Venice from Austria; I understand that this was not entirely a cooperative maneuver, which probably influenced the Austrian decision to get out of the Balkans while he still had some force: it was this very fall that Jamey strapped on his tiger-riding boots.<br/><br/>The northern Franco-German convoy from Belgium to Yorkshire was no less smart: by putting an army into England the westerners got a clear advantage in controlling the English SCs among which I was cavorting free of inhibitions at the time. This convoy I could foresee, but there was little to be done about it; I did seriously consider bringing in my own army from time to time to really lay claim to England, but ultimately I chose to remain strategically uncommitted there to optimize my presence in the Nordic area and the Baltic Sea: I knew that I needed the synergy advantages of holding the Baltic if I was to break into Germany later on, and giving up on Norway was a sure way to lose that chance. This choice made it a given that I would not hold English SCs long-term, which made my fleets in the area pure raiders: they were there just to fuck up with the integrity of the western defensive line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291500/#Comment_291500" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T19:39:06+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  7:39PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=18" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-18-R.png"/></a>As a result of the Austrian turn in 1909 the pretense of a war in the Balkans quickly quieted down as the westerners were forced to retreat to their primary defensive line in Italy. I was also bringing armies up to the front constantly, which meant that at the end of the year we would start to have some real pressure on the German home SCs; taking them was not really realistic, but keeping pressure on them was imperative so as to prevent a German advance and to prevent him from emptying any home SCs for building. Much of the tactical story of the last five years of play was about me picking specific move-sets that would prevent Germany from building should he make any gains.<br/><br/>We had a pretty good working relationship with Austria this year, with frank and agreeable tactical play. I felt like I had a relatively good handle on Jamey's interests, and I did my best to fulfill them to keep him happy. We even got him a build in Trieste, which is a pretty good outcome for a minor Power latched remora-like onto a giant.<br/><br/>Up north my fleet play was solid, but not brilliant. I was consistently forced to play the defense due to the larger forces the west had to bring into the war, but I managed to delay and confuse the lines sufficiently to prevent an overall offense from ever taking place. My tactical dictum was for the most part to ensure that any constructive plays by the west would have to be paid for in lost position elsewhere; for the most part this kept the situation stable and gave me time to build more fleets for myself. The tactical balance was in my favour in that the only position I needed to defend was in Norway, which freed up a couple of fleets to raid England, which in turn forced the west to keep a disproportionate amount of forces on duty second-guessing my raids.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-20-R.png"/></a>In 1911 I had the Alliance's number tactically - or so I thought. My plays on all fronts were finely tuned to make use of any logistical inefficiencies or misjudgments the opposition might make, and I did get what I hoped for when France held in Edinburgh and thus failed to oust me from London. However, this was also the year of Piers's finest play, a daring convoy from Kiel to Livonia: it's a testament to the clarity of my own move-set that this move, losing Piers the defensive strength of the single army, also immediately gave me access to Munich. Even then, though, the move was clearly advantageous to Germany in the short term: there would be inavoidable losses for me, he got a presence on the backside of StP, and while I did make some headway into the German homeland, there were plentiful French armies nearby to help plug the hole in his home defense. This was clearly the grimmest hour in my rise to hegemony.<br/><br/>In the fall I made an amazing save against Austria; Jamey had apparently decided that I was doing too well, and I managed to intuit this from his diplomacy, leading to an unplanned and unauthorized bounce in Budapest. Had that move gone through, I would probably have lost the war and had to turn to a draw arrangement of some sort; with the German raider already in Livonia I could hardly afford an Austrian one as well. In hindsight Jamey chose a fortunate moment for his betrayal here, as I needed badly to straighten up the lines, and his presence in Trieste was a constant threat: I could not bring my army in Serbia onto the front with him ready and all too willing to stab me. Once he gave me reason to put him out in Trieste, I immediately did and thus freed up an army that I would very soon need in Sevastopol.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=22" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-22-R.png"/></a>France should definitely have built a fleet in the winter of 1911 instead of another army. This was in general a problem for the west, they never used their material advantage to simply bring on 2-3 fleets more than I could muster to crush my Nordic presence. They had something like five years in which to do this after England crumbled, but I was never down more than one unit in the area. Partially this was due to tactics, of course: my own army in Finland was consistently useful in offensive tactics, while the French army in England was such that I was able to render it useless simply by not attacking England; once I left the place, that army became dead weight for the Alliance.<br/><br/>Piers over-committed himself with a second convoy to Livonia in the 1912 spring: not only are two raiders less effective than one due to the overlap in their threat zones, but Piers was also underestimating my strategic zeal: I knew that whatever happened in Russia proper did not actually matter as long as I could make a breach in Mun-Ber, so the constant convoys of force out of the area just redoubled my offensive efforts instead of forcing me to retreat and defend my home SCs as Piers perhaps expected. While my presence in Munich last year had been temporary, this second convoy made me a permanent guest in the Ber-Mun area. albeit one who regularly swung between the two as the tactics dictated. This meant that Germany would have to forget building in this game anymore: any losses he would sustain from now on would be permanent, and any gains he made would be meaningless for the west.<br/><br/>This year the southern situation reached the end-game position, more or less. What we had there was a my defensive stalemate on the Ionian Sea and a very slow and unlikely siege against Venice, held by the Austrian. It is noteworthy that had Germany not played that second army into Livonia, I would likely not have brought my Serbian army up north, either; instead, that army would've gone to Greece and then convoyed via Ion to Italy, potentially breaking the stalemate in the area. In hindsight I'd say that this would not have been as good a play as the one I got from the German convoy.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=23" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-23-R.png"/></a>Probably the proximate cause for why I was able to crawl into a solo victory in this game was in the Nordic exchange we had in the fall of 1912. At this point I had an equal number of forces in the area with the west (discounting that army in England), and we'd been dancing for a while, so I thought that I had Piers's number. Moving Nth-Hol was a very deliberate move for me in that it was predicated on one of the basic principles of tactics in this game: don't defend weak positions when you can attack out of them. As I was losing Nth anyway (or rather, as I was unwilling to compromise other concerns sufficiently to defend the place), it was imperative for me to attack out of there in a way that would turn the loss of position into equivalent gain of position or (even better in this situation) material elsewhere. Holland was a good target in that the only realistic attack on Nth would be coming out of Belgium; therefore the only reasonable alternatives in the situation would be that I'd either gain Holland or retain Nth, a very strong tactical position. As it happened Piers stepped into the trap and allowed me Holland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291501/#Comment_291501" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T19:39:31+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  7:39PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2010 8:08PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=24" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-25-O.png"/></a>For me 1913 was all about Munich: France had taken up defense of the place, and Vincent had a realistic chance of locking it down by simply putting an army into Burgundy to help in the defense. The complicating factor here was that if I attacked and seized Munich while Vincent moved another army in there, that would result in disbanding the army currently in position; not a major catastrophe, but possibly motivation enough to instead leave Burgundy empty for Munich to retreat to. As it happened, Vincent made a clear tactical error by first leaving Burgundy empty in the spring and then outright bouncing himself out of the place in the fall, giving me plenty of time to choose my moment for attacking - as I ultimately did in 1914.<br/><br/>A less egregious tactical error was Lon-Yor, Bre-MAO this same spring; our Nordic war was always a very delicate thing, and it was mostly controlled by small, individual force pressures. I doubt that I could've gained actual dominance in that war had the Alliance used their forces as effectively as possible, always ensuring that each and every unit does something proactive. This was my own principle: all of my units would always make moves that would require an equivalent exertion of force from the opposition to prevent me from gaining position or material. Moves like this strategic re-entrenchment France was doing to attack Norwegian Sea gave me breathing space in this, as they effectively kept the numerically superior Alliance force out of action while I crawled my way to domination of the Nordic area. I lost Norwegian Sea, perhaps, but gained a solid hold on Sweden and Denmark in exchange.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=26" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-26-R.png"/></a>In 1914 Germany should've moved his raider from Sevastopol to Anatolia; that would have split up his raiders and forced me to split up my internal security forces while giving him a good position from which the raider would have been very difficult to disentangle. I was pretty sensitive to mistakes like this at the time, as I was out for blood and very considerate of all the options the Alliance had available against me.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=27" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-27-R.png"/></a>1914 fall was a turn I planned with special care, as the game was running thin: the French decision to extend to seize the Norwegian Sea had given me an opportunity to seize the Nordic area, suddenly giving me some synergic attack options on Kiel and Berlin from the north. I was not worried about an attack on Norway from Norwegian Sea, as controlling Skagerrak and the additional forces that the Nordic area would allow me would make defense easy. However, the fact remained that the Alliance technically had more force than I did, and even in practice their immediately available force was near equal: I would have to make a clear break soon if I were to win this thing.<br/><br/>We had something of a guessing game with the Alliance in that fall move over a number of issues: they could attack either Norway or Denmark but not both, while I would have to retake Kiel or Berlin or retain Munich to stay even. The German army in Warsaw also had a couple of options; a horrendously risky attack on Silesia or a more conservative play towards Moscow; The Silesian attack would be effective in cutting a support for Munich, but if I played Sil-Ber, Warsaw would not only fail to foil my German operation, but it would also lose its position in Warsaw. As it happened War-Sil was what Piers played - I did not count on this, though, which is why I chose a very carefully balanced set of moves that ensured that no matter what Warsaw did, I'd gain a SC out of it: as it happened, that SC was Sevastopol instead of Berlin.<br/><br/>The real victory of the turn for me was not in Warsaw, though, but in Norway: the Alliance had two attacks on the Nordic area they could execute, and they chose the wrong one, causing me to regain Denmark, Kiel <i>and</i> Norway while Germany lost Belgium to France: a crushing defeat, putting me to 17 SCs. I was pretty surprised that I could outplay Piers and Vincent this much at this late stage of the game, as the assault they chose was clearly unlikely to succeed: my forces in Swe, GoB and Fin had a very limited number of useful plays to them, and the defense of Norway I opted for was the most obvious one of them as regards useful tactical positions for next year. I would have expected Ska S Bel-Nwy instead of the cut to Sweden, as that move would have succeeded certainly unless I used Denmark to cut Skagerrak - which would have been a very risky move with uncertain gain, and one that would have surely lost me Kiel.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/game_history.php?game_id=20202&amp;phase=O&amp;gdate=28" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-20202-28-R.png"/></a>The last year was something of a formality in that there was no longer any question of my victory as long as I played a conservative game; it was just a matter of time. The Alliance outplayed me in Tyrolia (in hindsight a clear mistake on my part, caused by my relief over the entire game), but that did not effect the outcome. Germany could have delayed my victory for a bit by keeping hold of his raiders, though: those two were both guaranteed to keep a SC in 1915 for a net total of +1 for him, which could have off-set any gains I made in the west simply because my forces couldn't necessarily march quick enough to take ground that fast. It was clear that the Alliance had lost their will to live, though: even the dependable Jamey had mixed orders with Vincent in the fall. I won cleanly by taking Warsaw, Munich and Berlin while losing Kiel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291506/#Comment_291506" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T20:47:21+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  8:47PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>As it happened, Vincent made a clear tactical error by first leaving Burgundy empty in the spring and then outright bouncing himself out of the place in the fall...</blockquote>\nNot my proudest moment!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12447/sg-diplomacy-league-game-4/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12447/sg-diplomacy-league-game-4">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12447/sg-diplomacy-league-game-4/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12447/sg-diplomacy-league-game-4/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12447/sg-diplomacy-league-game-4/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12447%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12447%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
