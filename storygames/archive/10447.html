The game is light-hearted and fast-paced. We don't keep track of XP or anything like that, just level up at the end of each session, and the GM hands out treasure based on a rough approximation of the treasure tables in the DMG. In the past we've fought zombies that were trying to steal steam tanks, in defence of a country called LIPTONSCHTEIN! (which could only be said in a guttural scream), and been pitted against D&amp;D pastiches of The Avengers by an asylum escapee who thought he was Nick Fury (we have since taken to calling our party The Avengers, having won the title in combat). Suffice to say it's a realm that is open to gonzo play and surprise.<br/><br/>But this Thursday was different. I had sent the above link to our GM the week before, gambling (correctly) that he would favour the low-prep approach and make use of it. And it was grand.<br/><br/>We started out a bit Lovecraftian, with shadow-haunted island monasteries that housed ancient evils, and curses that spread across the shallow bay into the nearby town. Once we got used to hearing the clink of dice in a clay bowl when we added details, we started to go a bit nuts, and really embraced the silly -- and the "hey, let's make this way too dangerous for ourselves by adding things way out of our depth!" factor was really encouraged by that 3-die bonus.<br/><br/>Our experience with the Dirty Dungeon prep was that our description and our RPing, and our use of the non-combat mechanics all blended together seamlessly. Sometimes a player would roll Diplomacy or Streetwise or History before adding a detail, and would tailor the information through the frame of "I recall a tale..." or "Hm, I rolled a 12 on Streetwise. I find an informant who knows..." Because I love mechanics like this and to try and assist our GM, I would occasionally ask questions of other players "Joe, you're a Bard, what can you tell us about..."<br/><br/>When we switched over to the "conventional" portion of the game, we immediately started noting things we should have included: "Oh, crap. We didn't ask that mad escapee about secret entrances. Ah, well. In the front door, then!" Also, we discovered that despite all of our prep, we could still be surprised. The Giant Stack of Milk Bottles Tied to a Cupcake trap that alerted the vampire minion guards was a particularly unexpected twist.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the DD approach worked great for our silly game, and I definitely got the impression it would work just as well for a thematically "more conventional" game. Me, I'd like to try it with a fear/insanity/supernatural horror-type game (CoC or <i>Nemesis</i>) because the investigation is always such a major portion of that, and yet it is often tedious and painful, except for the insanity parts.<br/><br/>Oh, one change from Wick's original: our GM got a Complication point every 5 minutes instead of every 10, just to keep things busy and exciting. He hasn't used any of them yet, and in fact, we don't know how many he has, since he did the timekeeping and we got sucked into the planning.<br/><br/>Any other Dirty Dungeons in play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
