I'm going to call it Camaraderie for the purpose of this discussion.  Thanks to everyone who dove into Camaraderie thread 1 (especially Graham).  <br/><br/>This thread is all about what I see as the big problems for the game.<br/><br/>The first thread agreed that there needs to be a strong authority of adversity (i.e. a GM).  This adversity needs to be structured carefully, so that individual results are much worse than group results.  Also, characters need to grow meaningfully in the course multiple sessions.<br/><br/><b>Problem <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b>:  The GM facilititates and observes the feeling but isn't part of the group - which is OK for a session, but not for EVERY session.  If the responsibility rotates, what about the player/GM who kills a character, or runs a bad session?<br/><br/><b>Problem <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></b>:  A game of Camaraderie can actually result in a lot of NEGATIVE intra group feelings if a player doesn't show and the game gets canceled or the opposition cannot be defeated without a missing player.<br/><br/>How can I solve these 2 problems?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121449/#Comment_121449" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T08:46:01+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  8:46AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you asking how to manage these (social) problems procedurally?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121452/#Comment_121452" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T08:51:08+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  8:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Are you asking how to manage these (social) problems procedurally?</blockquote>Just how to alleviate their impact.

It's like "Man, I thought I had you guys dead to rights! That thing where Collossus threw Logan into the air, and Storm guided him to the target with gusts of wind to take out the Sentinel was intense. I was sure it wasn't going to work, but you pulled it off."<br/><br/>Now, the resentment of the players for the killer GM is a little different issue. One thing I think that could alleviate the problem is to utterly, totally, completely forbid Rule Zero, hidden rolls and fudging of rolls. At that point, the GM has no power, without breaking the game, to fudge a roll to save a PC, nor to kill them. It's all the system, right there in the open for everyone to see. Combine that with something along the lines of Gerald says, and you'll eliminate a lot of the problem. <br/><br/>Frex: GM: "Hey guys, I got this mission, it's Comparative Difficulty Level (CDL) 0, meaning it's right at the same power level as your group of PCs. I could dial it up to CDL 1 or 2, and you guys could get better rewards, but it'd be a lot tougher."<br/>P1: "Nah, I don't think I'm in the mood for a really tough mission today. Maybe we could just bash some skulls? Maybe CDL -1?" <br/>P2: "I agree, a little mook-stomping is in order after the week I've had."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121496/#Comment_121496" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T10:51:03+00:00" title="January 23, 2008 10:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I can only speak for myself on the "what does a GM get" question, but personally I feel very rewarded by telling part of the story, as much as any other player does.

The game is a very isolationist game (in terms of PC interaction), but the way I've handled GM role is something which Camaraderie could learn from.<br/><br/>The way the game works is that each player has a seperate scene for their PC (go around in turns). The player narrates a crime for their character, and the GM acts as a Facilitator, asking questions ("Why does your character want <i>that</i> book?") and prompting ideas ("What about tying in your Contact?") and offering to play NPCs ("Did you want someone to act out the baker's daughter's part?").<br/><br/>Eventually, the scene is set and the crime is committed. And then the GM asks, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how much does this matter to your character?" The player answers 7. The GM asks self, aloud, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how much does this matter to the society?" The GM answers own question with 4. Adding 7 and 4 together, the GM has 11 points for this scene (plus any previous leftovers).<br/><br/>Then the GM stops being Facilitator, and starts being Interrogator. The GM's job is now to fuel and play the Inspectors, who seek to hunt down the PC and brainwash them into being better citizens. And the GM has a limited point economy and is expected to play it to the hilt.<br/><br/>And then, at the end of the scene, the player gets a Payout, equal to 11 in this case. And that's a cool advancement worth 11 points, and there's a chart of that stuff. So it self-balances by rewarding the player to the same degree that it empowers the GM's opposition.<br/><br/><br/>So, that's a formula that works. GM facilitates and is involved, acting as a creative partner and provider. Camaraderie is established between the GM and player, and then together they decide how deadly the GM's opposition should be. Then they shake hands like old friends about to fight a duel to the death, and the GM radically transforms into Interrogator and Adversary, and plays that to the absolute hilt, knowing that the social contract that was established demands it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122022/#Comment_122022" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T07:56:30+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  7:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.... thinking...<br/><br/><br/>What if the players bid coins before the battle, and the GM was responsible for using all the coins up during the battle?  <br/><br/>I.E.

Since the games that people reported in Camaraderie: Origins were all fairly long-running niche-protection specialist kinds of games, if we're supporting that then we have a lot of room to play with mechanics other than the coins.<br/><br/>Say we do a game, 1d6+Your Stat for each action.  You have some stats: might, agility, insight, will.  These are basically the 4 specialities.  Whatever else the coin mechanic does (action points, etc.) if there was a list of modifiers like this:<br/><br/>Basic Advantage (i.e. higher ground): +1<br/>Big Advantage (charging on horseback vs. footman with knife): +3<br/><br/>Teamwork with an NPC: +1<br/>Teamwork with another PC: +3<br/><br/>Then you're rewarding big teamwork with success even though it's not part of the coin mechanic specifically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
