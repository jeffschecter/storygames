When I fill one of these notebooks up they're a gordian knot of adventure notes, system design, rule fragments for various games, and random thoughts.<br/><br/>Which makes it pretty bloody inefficient trying to extract all the various bits that pertain to a single subject and synthesize it into a digital document.<br/><br/>I played around with updating a <a href="http://hargifex.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> as a to start this synthesis process.  But I keep going back to the notebook (the blog isn't with me on the T ride and the notebook is a habit I find hard to break) so this issue of transcription from handwritten notes to digital document continues to plague me.<br/><br/>I'm curious how other designers handle this.  Do you spurn handwritten notes and only record things in digital format?  Do you have to go through this same transcription process too?  Is it your favorite part - does it exite you or fill you with dread?  How do you manage your writing process and what secret ninja tricks have the veteran publishers developed and keep secret from the neophytes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77214/#Comment_77214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T19:12:25+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  7:12PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Computer, buddy.

For <i>Grey Ranks</i> words in German or Polish had their own style, so that when Patrick laid it out in InDesign he could easily identify them and make sure the characters got encoded properly.  We did the same thing with "See page XXX" references, styling them in hot pink so that we wouldn't miss any when editing.  Once the book is actually laid out, changes happen in the InDesign files, which are also versioned pretty much daily.  There were 64 stand-alone drafts before it got laid out, and another 8-10 after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77217/#Comment_77217" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T20:21:29+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  8:21PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I scribble notes on notepads during my commute to and from work.

She's an amazing editor, so after that first going-through, it was pretty solid.  Naturally, changes were made because of playtesting and feedback.  Then I put it all into a plain text file and sent it to Fred, who put it all in InDesign and made it amazingly pretty. Then we reviewed PDFs of his design and fixed a couple of things here and there.  I think we went through 4 post-layout drafts, including changes because of the proofs we ordered from Lulu.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77227/#Comment_77227" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T00:24:35+00:00" title="June 23, 2007 12:24AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I compose in text files -- sometimes using Pages or Word or email or whatever but always saving to text files.

(The life of a TA gives much time for such things, especially when the professor's lecturing.) After that I started an <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/suffadv/" rel="nofollow">online development journal</a>, putting the better parts of my notes online and getting feedback from time to time. The paper held game mechanics notes and very, very short versions of the civilizations (basically just their tech capabilities and their core values). More detailed descriptions of the civs got written in the online journal.<br/><br/>When it came to putting an initial version together, all I did was take the important parts from the dev journal and write things to tie them together properly. Now that I'm in the late stages of work, everything gets done in InDesign. I never did an outline; I have a half-dozen outlines from old books that either never got finished or went utterly different directions from what looked good in the outline.<br/><br/>The original version of Console went similarly, though the starting point was different. I wrote out the advice section first, with a lot of it on paper, and then borrowed my girlfriend's laptop to transfer and add. I still have the 20 or so individual Word files on various different console RPG clich\xc3\xa9s, though of course they got merged together in InDesign for the final version. <br/><br/>I have written some items entirely on computer, including The Undying Lands (which I still feel is one of my best works), but they tend to be shorter projects.

As ideas come to me that are ahead of what it is I'm working on, I just put a few blank lines at roughly where I think it will end up falling in the linear flow. If I write more than a paragraph, I give it it's own page in VP, and just link from the main page (one of the things I love about using a wiki like editor). I also have a page of random notes that I refer to. There's also pages that I've just C&amp;Ped things like suggestions and questions people have asked me about the game on forums, and good tips about design concepts. When I'm away from my computer, I jot things down in my Moleskine. I told myself that I would dutifully transcribe these notes in to VoodooPad, but I failed my Save vs. Disorganization.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep the VoodooPad, and all of my Illustrator files (I'm a graphic designer by trade, so a lot of things actually start out as a visual concept for me...

I like the little brown paper cover 30 pagers that fit in a shirt pocket. I write with a cross classic or a pilot varsity fountain pen. I have all sorts of codes for value of information in my notes, including handwriting style and page placement (if something is written in a semi-serifed capitol letter in the middle of the page, its something important). I'm a very fast hand writer and my penmanship is at a point that i can read just about everything i write. I can transcribe to type very fast as well. What i can't do is type what i'm thinking with any degree of accuracy or effeciancy. So i have to sort of write the game on paper before it gets put on the computer. I went through 4 drafts and 2 re-writes with primitive. I've gone through easily 3 or 4 times that with Sweet Agatha, and it's not done yet. I try to break things into as many differant .doc files as i can (as long as it makes sence). because when i sit back down to work i like to read everything i've written up to that point, and if i had to go through the whole thing i wouldn't ever get more than halfway done. <br/><br/>I guess Zeno also was familiar with my writing style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77449/#Comment_77449" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T09:00:56+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  9:00AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite notebook was a small-sized notebook bound in brown grocery-bad paper that I bought in China for, maybe, 5c?

Like the first thing you reach should be the first thing you're expected to do in the game, the next thing is the next thing, etc., from character creation (assuming that's first, and it often is, unless you need a setting dump first), etc. etc.<br/><br/>I also have several non-gamers read my texts over at various points in my process, because if THEY can't follow my game, I'm in real trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/beejazz" title="beejazz"><img alt="beejazz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/beejazz">beejazz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77504/#Comment_77504" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T12:50:32+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 12:50PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideas pop up in my head.

It'll probably be a year or two before I've got a finished product at this rate. I've got enough material, but I tend to be a perfectionist.<br/>\n<br/>\n^In regards to pictures, those are really really important to me and I don't know why. Or I do... because I draw alot and originally got into roleplaying because I just loooved the outlandish illustrations in 3.0s monster manual II. Another one of the reasons what I'm working on is going to take a while is that I need to find and convince an aritst with a better grasp of color to help me out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, now that I think of it...

I write games the exact same way.<br/><br/>I always carry a standard size sketchpad and 5-6 technical pens with me, which I fill with notes and sketches as ideas occur to me.<br/>When I've got an idea I want to refine, I brainstorm a few pages of mind maps for it.<br/>Then I walk around until I've got a particular chunk of the game in my head just the way I want it.<br/>I draw a mind map or flowchart of just that piece, making sure that each component at least appears on the map so it won't be forgotten.<br/>Usually the first flowchart is also my first playtest document (I do scenarios this way too).<br/>Then I write it out as a word doc.<br/>After each playtest or brainstorming session (i.e. me, a latte, and a long walk), I make a list of everything that came up.<br/>I go through the list and revise the word doc.<br/>At the same time I make a text file for idea dumping. If I get an idea that doesn't fit my current text, I drop it in the text file.<br/>At some point I print the word doc out and revise it in pen.<br/>If I REALLY care how it flows, I read it out loud.<br/><br/>What I end up with a bunch of chapters representing different pieces of the game.<br/>This process has a lot to do with never losing a thought or idea through forgetfulness, a major problem on my part.<br/>It's also a reflection of my hugely visual brain, since at any point the definitive design document is actually a mind map that no one's every going to see but me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meguey" title="Meguey"><img alt="Meguey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lumpley.com/megweb/dollz/1001.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meguey">Meguey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77589/#Comment_77589" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T18:05:39+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  6:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get one of those yellow steno pads with the line down the middle, tuck it under my arm or in my bag, and write every idea I have, anywhere I am. <b>1001 Nights</b> was mostly written on the walk back and forth from dropping off/picking up my kids, balanced on the stroller bar.<br/><br/>Then I type it all into Word, rearrange bits, print out, read, mark up, back to the computer, playtest, more mark-up notes, repeat until I feel content.<br/>Then it goes into InDesign, rearrange bits, print out, read, mark up, back to the computer, repeat until I feel it's finished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77621/#Comment_77621" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T19:51:40+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  7:51PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My ideas hit me in awkward places, like the shower.

Most stuff gets brainstormed into .txt, later those chaotic ideas are written into a Word .doc, and it stays there through whole bunchs of interations until it's baked.  At layout, the docs get imported into InDesign and final tweaks (add a word here, change the order of stuff there) happens for layout reasons.  Then copies are frozen in stone and stored in the vault for safekeeping.
