I tried to contact them via 3 email addresses and g+ about 6 times, with no response, over the course of a couple weeks. They finally reached out to me via g+ and apologized but didn't necessarily say they would send my book, but said they would look into my order.  They did send the PDF  when I first ordered the item.  I have since tried to contact them a couple times on g+ and email  to get a follow up  and received no response. I have the receipt and I'm 100% sure I purchased a book (+ PDF). And books are my preferred format. As most of you know, I purchased tons of Indie RPGs and Storytelling Games (seriously, no exaggeration), and I've never experienced anything like this. It's a fairly big publisher, in the indie scene, and I really don't know what to do.  What's your advice? Am I just being impatient? I want to purchase a lot of their other games, but I'm hesitant based on my experience.

The RPG designer is a pretty big name in our hobby.  I want every last person to be my friend and to think well of me in our hobby. Also, it seems like if this is a regular thing that I would've heard about people not getting their orders. Perhaps, they are just busy and I will just be patient and try to continue to reach out. It really sucks because they are a great designer, and I really want to purchase a bunch of their games. Your advice is very sound, but maybe there really is no answer because the way I want to handle it is so narrow in scope.  But a lot of times the reason I post these questions is because people at Story Games are a really good sounding-board for me to bounce ideas off of in order to make a decision and understand how I really feel about something. They do live in the US, as do I, but I totally agree that the minor financial loss isn't worth pursuing and that it would definitely be more of a pain than worth it. Thank you so much for your advice Eero :-) and your willingness to help :-) it is very much appreciated :-)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460336/#Comment_460336" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T21:14:55+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  9:14PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if the publisher in question has a lot of social capital, it's possible that others who are affected like you are have also decided to stay quiet so as to not rile up the fans. That sort of social dynamic does show up on occasion with human monkeys, after all.

The likeliest case in my experience, not knowing any particulars, is that they're just having a rough time in their private life, and as a hobby publisher that impacts their publishing activities: acute depression, a sick relative, whatever. If it's something like that, they'll probably get back on the saddle in a few weeks, with polite apologies to clients and customers.<br/><br/>The second-most likely case is that they've lost your order in some way; other business is going as usual, but for some reason your particular order has difficulties.

I don't think you need to go so far as "public shaming", but if you've purchased a product and now can't get the product or your money back, you're not in the wrong.<br/><br/>I've often found that posting something public will get people's attention where they might overlook a private message.<br/><br/>For example, "Hey, I bought your game on such-and-such a date. But I still haven't heard anything from you. Is there a good way to get in touch with you?"<br/><br/>A private message of this type is sent and receives no reply. Next, post this message on social media (e.g. on their Facebook wall). <br/><br/>This gives the game designer a chance to explain (e.g. "My house has burned down and I'm homeless. I'll be able to send books out again next month!"), or they will get to you quickly once they see how bad it looks.<br/><br/>I've never had to deal with this kind of thing with games, but I have in other work, and it's worked 100% of the time. (e.g. One client I bothered for *two years*, rarely responded or would just try to delay... I posted on their Facebook wall, and the message was deleted, and I was paid *five minutes later*.)<br/><br/>As long as you phrase the message nicely and give fair warning (which it sounds like you definitely have), I don't think you have any need to feel guilty about doing this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460342/#Comment_460342" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T21:49:49+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  9:49PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2017 6:36AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, if the publisher in question has a lot of social capital, it's possible that others who are affected like you are have also decided to stay quiet so as to not rile up the fans.
