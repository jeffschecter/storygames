ComiCon is over at the Mesa Convention Center (despite it being called Phoenix ComiCon). Bo needs people to run events. If you'd like to help out, give him a call at 520 730 4653. He's looking at two hour game slots (which can be combined, so if you've been itching to run a six-hour The Mountain Witch game, now is the time! (oh, and I'd totally play in it, too)). The gaming area isn't just RPGs, it's board and card games. Want to play Arkham Horror with a full eight investigators? Here you go. <br/><br/>He's really looking for people to run games on Saturday the 26th and the gaming area is open from 10 until 10. Sunday the gaming area is open between 10 and 6. If you run two events/four hours worth, Bo will comp the tickets for the whole show for you. He'll have more information on that. (I think it's something like you buy the cheap gaming pass and he'll reimburse you if people play in your game session and upgrade you to the full ComiCon ticket.)<br/><br/>As the con is Comics related, Superhero-themed games will probably be big draws. Boardgame-wise, Marvel Heroes would be the game  to bring.<br/><br/>Regular price tickets are $8 for the gaming area or $25 for the whole show if you just want to come and play games. There are going to be some board games provided for people to just pick up and play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119560/#Comment_119560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T21:34:16+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  9:34PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been told if you're shy about calling Bo, you can e-mail him at gaming@phoenixcomicon.com .
