Success might get them more money, new equipment, healing etc; failure might provide damage, enemies etc.<br/>- Provide choices that can affect the players' resources. Choosing one path through the mountains might give them a new friend; another might cause them to lose equipment.<br/>- Provide a few alternate endings to the scenario, based on the players' actions and the characters' dice rolls.<br/><br/>Any other ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164711/#Comment_164711" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T06:26:01+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  6:26AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2008 6:27AM by Rafael.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Let them create part of the scenario when you're getting started.<br/><br/>I ran a couple games of Battlestar Atlantica at a con, and both times, I started by letting the players create some of the core elements: the threat (weapons that were going to be used against civilian populations), the bad guys (a traitor in their midst -- whose identity wasn't known to them, but whose plan they designed -- meaning, they knew that the traitor was going to sell them out, but they didn't know who the traitor actually was at the start of the session), and so on.<br/><br/>This process took about twenty minutes, and it was a hell of a lot of fun. They were already sold on the scenario because they'd helped create it. Don't know if that works for everyone, but it was a pretty cool game.<br/><br/>2. Let them help describe major scenes.<br/><br/>Another thing I do, when running Dread: Pandemonium, is I get narration in short bursts from everyone around the table. It usually goes like this:<br/>PLAYER 1: I pick the lock and walk in, careful to avoid contaminating the evidence.<br/>PLAYER 2: I'm right behind her. Holding my shotgun, ready to shoot.<br/>RAFAEL: The room is (insert description here). There's a dead body at the far end of the room.<br/>RAFAEL (to player 1): Who is it?<br/>PLAYER 1: Uh, Caucasian male, mid-forties, heavy-set. Sitting with his back to the wall. Um, he's not our suspect. Never seen him before.<br/>RAFAEL (to player 2): What killed him?<br/>PLAYER 2: At first, uh, we think natural causes. No injuries that we can see. Then we hit the lights and see that he's sitting in a pool of blood. We roll him over and see that his back is ripped open. Doesn't look like an entry wound -- it looks like something ripped itself out of him.<br/><br/>So now I've got a few things to work into my canned scenario, but they've got some authority over the situation. This technique always seems to work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164729/#Comment_164729" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T08:53:21+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  8:53AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2008 8:58AM by Valvorik.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Others have said that a "railroad" should be like amusement ride - you can't go off the rails but you can design exciting scenes it goes into, ones that are interactive, that change what will be experienced in the scenes that follow.  In a classed D&amp;D scenario, this means exciting set pieces that showcase iconic threats, add a novel game experience and call on PC's to utilize all skills and Players to show their mojo.  Lame Mage's "action schticks" (fights on top of trains etc.) are an example of this sort of thing.<br/><br/>As noted, the ride should be built to respond to the preferences/character goals of Players/PC's.<br/><br/>A railroad doesn't always mean PCs/Players have no impact on course of adventure/content of scenes.<br/><br/>Design can provide impact from choices in one scene to the next, reincorporating events from prior scenes so that it's clear Players do have influence on the adventure content even if not the main scenes - you will encounter the troll at the bridge after you encounter the witch at the gingerbread cottage, but your choices of how to deal with the troll are influenced by what you did back at the gingerbread cottage.<br/><br/>Other suggestions:<br/><br/>Ensure there is a mix of "scenes the PC's walk into knowing what they are facing and able to plan, rewarding planning/strategy" (e.g., scouts report bandits are hiding up head, preparing to attack the caravan as it enters that defile) and "scenes that come at the PC's fast and furious in a <i>think fast</i> mode" (bandits attack you as your pass through the defile).<br/><br/>Across scenes, time limits such as \u201csomething happens at sundown\u201d keep things tense and action moving.  For example:<br/>\u2022\tA time limit as some doom visibly approaches (overwhelming allies for foes, the descending ceiling, the ritual draws near completion);<br/>\u2022\tA time limit as some advantage or goal is imperiled (the fire gets closer to the map, the blade descends towards the sacrifice, the platform on which the grail floats is gradually dissolving as it floats in the acid);<br/><br/>If an overall scenario or individual scene has more than one menace, objective, obstacle in it then it is more interesting.  Have more than one thing going, more than one axis for the tactical and strategic elements of scenes can work along:<br/><br/>\u2022\tMore than one reward or goal at stake, requiring character revealing choice;<br/>\u2022\tMore than one type of threat or source of danger (e.g., creature threat, environmental threat, threat of life and limb, threat to character objective/values);<br/>\u2022\tTwo targets being menaced; two villains making different escapes to choose between protecting/taking down;<br/><br/>A second axis is that there is a more narrative or plot outcome at stake beyond \u201cwin-lose\u201d if the scene is a combat-action type challenge..<br/><br/>Consider making the railroad one that still does have some junction lines.  A flowchart in which there are choices (you will face "Cult Gathering in Cavern" and "Mastermind in Lair" encounters, but to reach them you have choice of "Sneaking the Tomb Entrance" or "Posing as Cultist" or "Busting in Front Door" scenes).  Even a good "dungeon map" is more than a "straight line of rooms" (see <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/dnd/dungeonmaps.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/dnd/dungeonmaps.html</a> for a discussion of this).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164760/#Comment_164760" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T10:43:06+00:00" title="August 24, 2008 10:43AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D;'s Dungeon Master Guide for 4th Edition includes excellent advice you could use for linear scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also enjoy <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.strolen.com/content.php?node=4276" rel="nofollow">The 5 Room Dungeon</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164771/#Comment_164771" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T11:46:58+00:00" title="August 24, 2008 11:46AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What really worked for me was:<br><br>- The possibility that the PCs could die.

Or put differently: GMs should run their games, not the scenarios. <br/><br/>Say goodbye to the idea that it's your job to get the plot from A to B. Or that you absolutely have to reach the climactic confrontation the way it is described in the book. Scenarios are just a number of prepared situations to throw at the players, who in turn are expected to mix things up when trying to do whatever it is they're trying to do. <br/><br/>As the GM you should play the world and the NPCs reacting to the players' actions. The scenario will help you with this, but it will not do your job for you. It's still up to you to figure out what happens next, how it happens, how it presents itself to the characters and (if you're so inclinced) how it fits into the "story". Accept the fact, that given a energetic group, you'll only get to use a fraction of the scenario. That is a good thing. (What's the point of buying a scenario and using it up completely at the first go?)<br/><br/>The biggest mistake one can make with a scenario is to let it replace the GM and his input. Once you've done that... you're up railroad creek with no paddle. You really don't need any clever variations on player input to make the most of a scenario, you find too constraining. You just need to remind yourself: you're the GM. You have as much authority over the game-world and NPCs as the players do over their characters. <br/><br/>Roleplaying games are about creating the plot, not replaying it after a book that only the GM has read.<br/><br/>Also... the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn\u2019t have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164802/#Comment_164802" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T14:12:57+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  2:12PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Georgios, stop ranting, please.

Lots of Players seem to be comfortable with and want this style of play where they "receive story".<br/><br/>I define railroading to mean a series of specific scenes are predetermined to be played out, with the key elements of the scene known in advance.  There may be optional scenes but there are a high number of "hard points" that are unavoidable.  This usually (not invariably) means that there is really a "hidden story" known to the GM that already exists before play starts - the story that takes PC's between these scenes.  This "hidden GM's story" is what some players expect to exist and be entertained by, having some influence on its outcome but not having the responsibility to ensure there is a story ("I'll just play my character and follow the goals I've established for them and told GM, and because of the GM's design it will all work out into a story").  Play "fills out the outline of the GM's story and determines some key outcomes" but doesn't really change the key scenes.<br/><br/>I define this a "light railroading" rather than the more heavy handed GM forcing player choices type of railroading.  Unless Players are committed to "going along" to some extent (you say giants killed your family, the GM presents a mission against giants, you sign up), it's hard to have a set of predetermined scenes without heavy handed limits on Player choices though that is part of the GM's skill.  <br/><br/>Dungeons and other "site-keyed adventures" are easy railroads because Players accept the convention that "scenes are limited by the routes of travel on the map", whereas non-site based adventures are more difficult to run that way without having the "tracks become more visible" (you can do it in a one-off, but in ongoing play to have the phones out and local police unavailable every time becomes a bit much).<br/><br/>The advantage a railroad of scenes offers that can be mined is that in knowing that particular scenes will be faced, a game system which allows "rich portrayal/interaction with scene elements" (such as a tactics-heavy game system) allows a "GM as entertainer" to meet Player expectations.  To have the rules relevant to that situation at their fingertips, to have designed something as interesting as possible along whatever dimensions that table wants, to ensure each Player sees scenes where their abilities, goals, roleplay goals etc are brought to the table.<br/><br/>Many of my suggestions are based on the idea that "in railroad play, the scope of Player choice should shift from "what scene is next" to "choices within scenes" and that the return on giving up choice in the former is an increase in the choices available in the latter.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164818/#Comment_164818" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T15:25:21+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  3:25PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>What are some good ways to make a linear, railroaded scenario fun for the players?</blockquote>\nSome people don't like linear railroaded scenarios. I would generally consider myself one of them. However, I have friends who love love love linear railroaded scenarios. And no they aren't the GM.<br/><br/>So, the first thing I'm wondering is, are you asking what's a good way to make a linear railroaded scenario that I, Christopher Hearns, will enjoy? Or are you asking what's a good way to make a linear railroaded scenario that my friends, who love love love them, would enjoy? Because I think the answer differs.<br/><br/>That being said, there's an interactive fiction called <a href="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/2889" rel="nofollow">The Baron</a>, which is completely linear and railroady and I love love love it. But at it's heart it's a sequence of key scenes, which you will hit, and you will hit them in order, and yet somehow I enjoy it. And I'm bringing it up because I would enjoy it just as much as an RPG. If I were railroaded in this manner, I would have fun.<br/><br/>The trick is though to figure out why I find it fun. And on this I'm still not sure. I think it has something to do with the fact that while you have no control over whether or not you hit the scenes, you do have absolute control over how you deal with the scenes. Like, no matter what you do you will go from scene one to scene two, so I'm not looking for the "solution" that will let me progress, I'm actually making a statement by the method I employ to move on. And when the scenario is finished, all those choices I've made, when looked at together, say something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164862/#Comment_164862" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T00:37:09+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 12:37AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your questions, Christopher. <br/><br/>The reason I'm asking is that I'm coordinating a crew of freelance scenario designers for L\xe6relyst. In L\xe6relyst, teachers run games for a class of students. This provides us with some challenges, the main one being that <i>if we want this method to be used widely</i>, we can't expect teachers to have excellent GM skills. In fact, we can't expect any prior experience. So we need to make very robust scenarios that can more or less be read straight from the book and still work. Tight constraints.<br/><br/>So, to pose the question more clearly: <b>If you were to <i>write down</i> a linear scenario, for a GM with <i>no</i> prior experience and very little tolerance for public failure and wasted time - what elements could you introduce to make this fun?</b><br/><br/>I've mostly gone the way of the Fighting Fantasy books. I think Algi's spot on when he says PC's need to be able to fail - perhaps they die; perhaps the mission is a disaster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165342/#Comment_165342" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T11:51:50+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 11:51AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2008 11:56AM by Tristan.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I have found that works the best for me is an Illusionist type of light railroading.<br/><br/>I prepare some scenes, encounters and key moments to advance the plot. I design the NPCs, tools and rewards. Then I lightly sketch the "map" that I'll present to my players (note that the map could or could not be a physical map, since it could instead mean the basic structure for a story).<br/><br/>Once in play, I present the first scene, then allow my players to proceed any way they see fit. They advance, and when I feel it is the right spot or moment, I improvise to adapt one of my prepared scenes/encounters, adapting it to what the players did and decided.<br/><br/>So at the end of the session, they were allowed to pick any choices they wanted, their actions had an impact in the story and the way the events unfolded, yet I got away with what I wanted as a GM. I got the chance to use (most of) my scenes, events, characters and stuff.<br/><br/>The main problem with this method is that you'll require some basic improvisation skills (what if the characters kill an important NPC too early? You'd need to <i>ad liv</i> a new, probably related and similar character and find a way to subtly integrate him to the story), and sometimes even some mature and fair, yet arbitrary use of the infamous "Golden Rule".<br/><br/><i>Edit</i>:<br/>The easiest way to use this is in a dungeoncrawl or similar game. It is simply a matter to make a non-linear and multi-pathed map and do not link the encounter and scenes to specific parts of the dungeon, but to improvise them in at any point it would seem appropriate. I started doing this to avoid my games getting boring if by chance (which happened too darn commonly) they picked to advance through the map in a way they avoided too many encounters and scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165354/#Comment_165354" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:14:40+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:14PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think this problem has been well explored by computer games - look at the Quest for Glory series, King's Quest, Zork, Myst, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165374/#Comment_165374" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:39:49+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2008 12:42PM by Andy.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, I think the answer is *increase character drama*.

See, one of the big problems that happens with a lot of linear games is that someone introduces the game like "Its a RPG, you can do anything!" where really, its a RPG and you can do anything that won't break the game, violate the rules, or throw the advancement of play off track. So, I usually let players know when their options are limited. Sometimes this is as subtle as a bat "no, you can't do that, you'll break the game.' Most often, however, its through a combination of more subtle and ongoing systemic clues -- things like "So do you go to confront Rock, or do you want to try to kill Archangel now?" rather than "so what do you do next?" or "Which of your weapons do you use to attack?" rather than "So what do you want to do?" or "are you going to attack him or run?" <br/><br/>Guiding questions, they are a joy, so long as people are okay with being guided.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ola%20J." title="Ola J."><img alt="Ola J." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ola%20J.">Ola J.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166294/#Comment_166294" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T05:48:06+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  5:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2008 5:51AM by Ola J..">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Railroads are perfectly fine, as long as they don't derail or lead nowhere. If they are entertaining and cool stuff keeps happening my experience is that they can be very enjoyable, especially for younger people.<br/><br/>I think the first point is to make sure that all the players are on the same page: <br/>You are all members of organization A, your boss B wants you to find gizmo C and bring it to location D. Then plotting out a route with a few diverging paths to that location. With the basic structure robust and the paths being rather obvious (left or right? Slay the orcs or bargain with them?) it should be fairly easy to run.<br/><br/>Also, one trick that I always used in my years as an illusionist GM: <br/>The GMs mouthpiece, an NPC the characters can turn to whenever they're stuck and who can lead them in the right direction. Most often I've done these in the form of a Mentor, at one time it was a madman that followed the party around and in his occasionally lucid moments would tell the players something important, and I guess it could also be items like a magical map or a genie in a bottle or something like that. In fact, I suspect that could work very nicely for kids - a portable clue-dispenser that can only be used a limited amount of times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166302/#Comment_166302" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T08:29:48+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  8:29AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2008 8:30AM by Matthijs.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ola J.</cite>a portable clue-dispenser that can only be used a limited amount of times.</blockquote>\nYou know, this is pretty cool if used as a resource.

Here's some kinds of heavily railroaded scenarios I've been in:<br/><br/>I've played heavily railroaded CoC scenarios, and had no problem with that: The fun for me there was acting in character, and doing that dance of "wanting to play up the horrors inflicted on my character" ("Oh no, Mr. Bill, don't look at the demon painting of Ghatanothoa! Ohhhh Noooooooooo!") vs "getting through the scenario alive". But having said that, there was never anything like deep character drama/melodrama between the characters.<br/><br/>I've played in heavily railroaded fantasy scenarios which were still fun even without a lot of character drama, because the ride was exciting and even though there wasn't a lot of choice, the GM was inspired enough to make it all interesting, and fun to play along with anyway (they were simply good at telling stories).<br/><br/>I've played in heavily railroaded fantasy scenarios which simply sucked, because the GM wasn't as good. The fact that we had no choice was too transparent, the logic getting us moving from one scene to the next was too terribly strained, etc. And there was no character drama or even interesting background story going on, enough to keep me/us satisfied through the game.<br/><br/>Now, contrasting that to what I was saying about some other games I've run or played in. Frex, a local game of Tenra I ran a bit ago:<br/>There were four characters. <br/>They were eventually going to meet up in the first act (two groups of two friends meet and decide to team up).<br/>In the second act they were going to meet and defeat an old ruin's spirit guardian.<br/>In the third act they were going to encounter a haunted village, and hear a story about the evil baddie from a shrine maiden.<br/>In the final act they were going to face up with and defeat an evil baddie in his forgotten castle at the top of a mountain.<br/><br/>None of that was in question, and the scenario events made sure that those events happened as written, more or less (the heroes talked to the ruin guardian rather than fighting it, but they still "defeated" it through talking; and the shrine maiden became an undead kugutsu doll). At the end, one of the players decided to side with the evil baddie against the other players, but he too was defeated with the evil baddie. Railroad from start to finish.<br/><br/>All the character stuff, though, that was heavily emphasized, and it was also totally left in the hands of the players. So they had that complete freedom over what they did with and said to the other characters. While it steered the minutia of the events ("I side with the baddie!"), it didn't really change anything. I didn't have an option for, "what if the characters decide not to visit the ruins/village/mountain fortress?". I steered things so that that stuff *happened*, and without actually saying "OK guys, now you all have to go to the next encounter, which is at a village", I did all sorts of GM tricks to make those things come about in the end. <br/><br/>But I allowed them to have total character relationship freedom. And sure, that could be said about the railroad situations listed at the top of my post (ex: My CoC/D&amp;D characters had the freedom to play up relationships with other characters), but the thing is the games themselves, nor the GM or other players, really put any emphasis at all into drama. So character drama/melodrama was simply not on the table, and trying to force it as a player would have been disconcerting to the others.<br/><br/>I guess, in the end, if you want to (as a GM), you can start off a campaign or scenario, knowing that there's not much real freedom for the players, and yet doing things in whatever system you're using to create strong character drama.

The shape of the setting and general conflicts that will figure, yes - in fact we can cocreate those with me no more author than they.  However, then what to do with all of it is for me to take away behind the curtain.

The following points are especially nice, since they can be described in a structured and clear way, based on explicit game mechanics:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br>- Make it so that each scene or location, give you something useful for the climax.<br>- Since you know the scene and locations before hand, take the time to fill them with interactive cool features.<br>- Certain features could help or harm based on how you interact with them.<br>- Put some sort of time pressure on the scenario. Time running out + consequences is fun!</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nFor instance, characters need to collect 3 clues/keys/weapons from 5 locations. Some locations have the stuff they need, some don't; sometimes they need to roll dice, sometimes they need to think smart. Each location uses a specified amount of minutes, and in 15 minutes the first bomb blows up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166554/#Comment_166554" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T04:18:46+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  4:18AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!!!

Consider it stolen.<br><br>I would also add:<br><br>- Place some clues in each location about the contents of adjacent locations. <br><br>These can take whatever form you like, but give the players some idea of how to choose the next location they wish to explore. For instance, if one location is "the City Hall", you might have a sign pointing to the Bridge Leading Out of Town that says "There Lies Danger", some muddy giant footprints leading into the Dark Forest behind the City Hall, and a very sketchy NPC loitering on the front steps that, if talked to, REALLY try to convince them to come with him to the Bar Next Door.<br><br>As another, unrelated point, I'd like to mention that railroading/linearity can happen at a great variety of scales. For instance, in Jenskot's method, each location probably corresponds to a scene or two. Within those boundaries (of a location and one or two scenes), the players have great freedom.<br><br>A different setup might be much more controlled _within_ scenes. A typical computer RPG might be a good example. The first time you walk into the Prison, so-and-so will talk to you and start a fight; the second time you'll see Wendy crying and she'll ask you to help her find her parents, etc.<br><br>At the other side of the spectrum, I once played in a campaign where the PCs were a team of operatives on a spaceship traveling from point A to point B. Getting there would take about six months, in game time. Every couple of days, we had to stop at a different planet to refuel. Since they were pretty much strung out in order, along our projected route, we had no choice at all about which planet to go to next. However, once we got to the planet itself, we were completely "off the rails", and anything could happen. We typically spent from two to four sessions on each planet.<br/><br/>Thinking about the "scale" of the railroad tracks in this manner might be helpful in the design of a linear scenario--how much scope DO the players' decisions have?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166677/#Comment_166677" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T14:56:30+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  2:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clues about adjacent locations is hot!
