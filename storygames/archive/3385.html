Of the four players, none had played Ganakagok before, although three of them had played some Burning Wheel or Burning Empires.  It seemed to go over well and I've posted a lightly edited file of the game here: <br/><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Ganakagok_all" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.archive.org/details/Ganakagok_all</a><br/>for anyone interested in listening in.<br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76605/#Comment_76605" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T09:18:37+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  9:18AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting this, Mel. An interesting game! <br/><br/>The interesting moment for me was the scene where the clever ice-walker encountered the shape-shifting spirit bear princess and kept agreeing to do her bidding -- follow her, kiss her -- in order to have his sins washed away. I think you expected that at some point the player would say, "No, I resist!" and so you kept pushing for that moment in order to be able to say, "Hey, that's the conflict." I think at any point after the player said, "She's going to wash away my sins if I follow her? That's a great deal!" you could have said, "Okay, the cards will tell us the consequences of that choice." As it turned out, that is pretty much exactly what did happen, and you were right to go to the cards when you came to the point where you said, "Okay, guys, I'm drawing a blank here." That blank means you've reached the moment where the player's choices for the character signal that it's appropriate to turn to the game mechanics to see what happens next.<br/><br/>And it was nice that the character's fate (to be turned into a talking bear) helped when it came time to convince the people to go south.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76608/#Comment_76608" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T09:33:55+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  9:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Thanks for posting this, Mel.

I thought he would balk way earlier at doing her bidding.  And I'm trying to be conscious not to identify a conflict too soon so that a lot can happen in any character's turn.  So when Billy's character (as it turns out) kept agreeing to do what the princess asked, it was clear we had to keep moving the scene forward because I wasn't providing him with any meaningful dilemma.  It was only when we all realized that to have the character's sins washed away meant becoming a bear that he resisted.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
