You lay down  Identity cards, and players connect the ones that are adjacent with Haps (happenings) and you have story cards inserted into the growing map between those cards in response. When I realized what I was doing, I began to wonder how many other games out there do the same thing. Elizabeth Shoemaker's <i>It's Complicated</i> does work on a relationship marker board for instance, which is probably why I like it so much. Out There, the game challenge entry I wrote of company number 2 rolls hooks which give a relationship between the character and the budding mystery too. There are probably a lot more examples, its just I don't see any easy way to search them out. So here I am, asking people to point the ones out that they know and maybe describe them a bit too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189006/#Comment_189006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T09:18:46+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  9:18AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Taste For Murder is a big relationship map game.

In Fantasy Flight's Android board game, there is a relationship map showing how major organizations in the game world are connected to the Conspiracy. During play, you can place a puzzle piece that connects organizations to the conspiracy and one another.<br/><br/>What's weird about it is that there's no narrative importance or impact to mapping the conspiracy. It is merely mechanical, providing a reward for placing a piece, and impacting your victory points at the end. Basically a relationship map is created as a side effect of reward-driven play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189022/#Comment_189022" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T10:26:18+00:00" title="January 19, 2009 10:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The story stuff seems to be important to the players of <i>Android</i>, though, from what I've observed.

It can be people, ideas, practices, organizations, concepts, etc. Anything you can hate Hate HATE is fair game. Tying these hatreds together begins to connect the players. Perhaps the person you hate knows the person I hate. Maybe the organization you hate proselytizes the idea I hate. Stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the game is about changing the present by changing things in the past, the web also acts as a guide for how the ripples of your changes will spread to affect other things. Maybe you'll improve something for yourself, but it will make other things worse for you. Maybe everything for you will be perfect, but it'll fuck over someone else's situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nReCoil also uses one, but it's not heavy. It can be just a list, though I think it works better as a web. It helps set up how the NPCs in the scenario may be related, and can help build the situation once play commences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189156/#Comment_189156" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T10:06:12+00:00" title="January 20, 2009 10:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My game <i>A Flower for Mara</i> uses a relationship map on the character sheet itself to easily position the various characters in relationship to each other.
