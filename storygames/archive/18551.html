Like, if you want to encourage more mechanical interaction between PCs, I could see giving every PC a free Aspect called something like "We've got history," which you can invoke anytime you want to aid (or interfere with?) a PC, giving THEM instead the rolling bonus from the Aspect instead of yourself. <br/><br/>What makes Hx particularly interesting to me, however, is that you track it separately for each PC. I feel like that might get cumbersome in Fate \u2013\xa0would you keep a separate "Hx pool" for each character, AND a pool of Fate Points for all your other Aspects? (I certainly wouldn't want to, but for whatever reason, it doesn't bother me to have all that separate Hx in Apocalypse World ... maybe because we don't actually throw around colored beads to track Hx in Apocalypse World, whereas that's much more common when playing Fate.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417299/#Comment_417299" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T07:35:50+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  7:35AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would use an "Hx" Aspect, but mix in some of the Fate Fractal and make it stunt-ish. You can invoke that Aspect for a bonus equal to its current rating. (So, "Hx: Fetch danced to my tune (3)" could be invoked for a +3.) You advance that rating as normal. You can also Compel it for troubles related to it. Then when you reset Hx, you rewrite the Aspect.<br/><br/>Remember that Fate is an engine, and you can scrap bits, customize bits, flesh bits out and Frankenstein stuff together with abandon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
