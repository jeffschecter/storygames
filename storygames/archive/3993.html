I love the Delta Green fiction and like DG rulebooks, although the obsession with technicalities around secret agencies (and subagencies, and departments, and guns etc...) was putting me off a bit (so I was more and more inclined to GM a 1927 Arkham game). Plus I don't like the BRP system and therefore decided to settle down with d20, although that would not be my optimal system pick - but I guess I am too lazy for a more demanding conversion of something else and I'm not sure FATE or PTA would handle it well. (Though I got very enthusiastic about some of the ideas for CoC and handling sanity, floating around on this forum and the Forge and I think they could be implemented in a d20 game.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter Cold City. I encountered the mention of it on this forum recently again and although I am still not impressed much with the preview of the basic rulebook, the preview version of the Cold City Companion got me going. Now, before I buy it I would love to hear opinions on the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Is it suitable for a Mythos-themed game? If yes, is it suitable for Delta Green without a lot of fuss?<br/>\n- Can it be used to model CoC sanity, or at least some effects of insanity, as part of its mechanics?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much,<br/>\nMichal                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89533/#Comment_89533" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T12:33:44+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 12:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To the first question, yes. <i>Cold City</i> should do a good job as a CoC/DG system.<br/><br/>For the second, all conflicts can leave you with consequences on a character.

On a player level, the differences between these nationalities are easy to grasp intuitively based on stereotypes we carry anyway.  So in re-working them, I'd make the differences really enormous.  <br/><br/>The claustrophobia of post-war Berlin as a setting is also a little thematic - if your game is free-wheeling, you'll lose this.  Sort of up to you as to whether that's important, but I really like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bifi" title="Bifi"><img alt="Bifi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bifi">Bifi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91994/#Comment_91994" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T23:53:51+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jason.

Cold City does rely fairly heavily on the environment of Berlin during the Cold War. However, ou could very easily have agency agendas as opposed to the blanket 'national agendas'. And, to be fair, this was always the intention. National agendas can be handed down to the character from a government, an agency, a military goup, etc. As long as they in some way represents the interests of that national group.<br/><br/>As for other places? I'm unsure about that one. As Jason said, the environment of Berlin in 1950 is very much part of the  game as a whole. There are other locations I could think of transferring it to, although they aren't actually during the Cold War. Constantinople in the post-WW1 period was divided by the Allies and full of competing factions (the British, French, immigrant White Russians fleeing the Revolution, Turkish Nationalists and so forth). Cold City may work very well in that environment. Another Cold War setting would have to have an equally strong level of input from all sides in the conflict.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bifi" title="Bifi"><img alt="Bifi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bifi">Bifi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92703/#Comment_92703" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T01:28:27+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  1:28AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much for your insightful comments!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichal                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
