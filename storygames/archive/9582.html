We have a home made PDF that we'd like to print and have bound for personal use.  I'd also like to give a few away to the other contributors and to my players.  Thing is I'm not sure what art in the thing (and maybe some copy/pasted background text) might be copyrighted.  We just looked and found whatever looked good.  Is this a problem?  I'm not going to sell anything just make usable copies.  <br/><br/>Sorry if this is obvious, none of us are really sure.<br/><br/>Thanks.

Under the Berne Conventions on Copyright (which the US and most of Europe are signatories to, along with a lot of other countries), anything someone puts in a "fixed form" (i.e., records in some manner, rather than performing it "live" or just imagining it) is automatically copyrighted, and no copyright notice is required.  Only things that are explicitly placed in the public domain, or whose term of copyright has expired, are not copyrighted.<br/><br/>3 - Whether or not you're selling something makes no difference for whether it's copyright infringement.  The most it may affect is what sort of damages they'd be able to collect from you.<br/><br/><br/>Now, from the practical point of view:<br/><br/>If your circulation is going to be that small, chances are that none of the people whose work you took is ever going to hear about it.  They're not going to sue you or prosecute you for what they don't know about.  If you want to minimize the chance of problems, I would suggest giving your contributors and players paper copies, instead of the PDF -- that makes it considerably less likely that one of them will decide to post it up on the 'net, where it could be easily copied thousands of times and become a much more major deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212588/#Comment_212588" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T07:57:42+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  7:57AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an idea that a forum community developed.

Using stuff without permission, less cool. If you genuinely can't track down the owners, perhaps put a note in the PDF saying that, if they contact you, you'll gladly credit them.<br/><br/>Nobody expects you to do the impossible, but it'd be nice if you attempted to do right by the people whose work you used.
