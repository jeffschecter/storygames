I can't help but feel like the meat of Dogs is the question of "are you really justified in doing X?" Because the players are Wild West paladins tasked with stopping sin by whatever means possible. The dramatic element is "how much ordnance are you willing to deploy in the name of justice, and how much mercy do you allow?"<br/><br/>A raging inferno doesn't have much ambiguity about it.<br/><br/>EDIT: The suggestion of Dread is very good, I think. I don't know how you'd incorporate the tactics element into it, though.

Maybe after every round fire spreads and gets worse, adding more flame tokens to the board. And the difficulty to put out a fire increases for each fire token in an area. Of course, after a certain qty, the fire tokens are removed because everything in that spot has been burned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438394/#Comment_438394" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T14:17:29+00:00" title="September 16, 2014  2:17PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2014 2:27PM by AsIf.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second <a href="/forums/profile/deinol">@deinol</a> 's vote for the AW engine.

I think for my players the system priorities would go somewhat like this <br/><br/>Listed in order of importance<br/>1. A system for <i>fighting</i> fires. This is where the game should be fun, challenging, and even a bit scary. <br/>a. Approaching the fire should require some tactics.  Fires should feel different according to the location and intensity. I don't want my players feeling bored and saying "ohh its another fire". I want a fire at a diesel plant to feel different than a house fire, or a forest fire.<br/>b. The players should feel the pressure of a building "coming down around them". They are essentially on a timer and choices must be made. Do you save the kid or the old lady? Do you go back in after one is brought safely outside? <br/><br/>2. Drama outside of the fire. The players should have scenes where they can flesh out their characters, and explore some fire-house politics. There are cuts to fire houses, the equipment is bad, an arsonist is on the loose - what do we do!? <br/><br/>3. Camaraderie. When a PC dies or something tragic happens. It should take a toll of the firefighters in some way.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438400/#Comment_438400" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T16:03:37+00:00" title="September 16, 2014  4:03PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2014 4:04PM by AsIf.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome, <a href="/forums/profile/icemaster109">@icemaster109</a>.  I think you're just the person for the job!  Sounds like you'll have to do some research into fires and fighting them.  Then with that in mind you might treat a fire as a "Front" and different paths it might take as Dangers.  There would have to be some prep for each session if you really want tactical considerations and material burn rates to be involved (making the diesel plant more dangerous than the house fire, for instance, or considering which parts of a building are the most combustible and therefore likely to go up in flames first, or considering the direction of the wind and which way the fire will spread, etc).  "Backdraft" of course had a lot of awesome details in it, but I can't think of any more sources.<br/><br/>Remember it's not <i>all</i> fires, though.  You can work other sorts of emergencies and even criminal investigations into it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438401/#Comment_438401" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T17:15:12+00:00" title="September 16, 2014  5:15PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Fate Core supplement Worlds on Fire, Jason Morningstar has a game called<i> Fight Fire </i>that is basically this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438404/#Comment_438404" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T21:38:25+00:00" title="September 16, 2014  9:38PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In the Fate Core supplement Worlds on Fire, Jason Morningstar has a game called<i> Fight Fire </i>that is basically this.</blockquote>\nMentioned in the OP. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438413/#Comment_438413" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T05:02:16+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  5:02AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a reason Fate was a good fit for this, because it does not differentiate between the physical and the emotional so much in terms of structuring conflicts. So if that system is off limits to your group, I'd first ask why. If it is because of this feature, I think you may be looking at switching between two different games, or you may be out of luck. If it isn't, find another game your friends like that similarly handles conflicts very broadly. I agree that, if you want to start from scratch, there's a very good firefighting game in the bones of Apocalypse World. <br/><br/>I'll also point out that a ton of useful research went into my setting that isn't remotely specific to Fate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438414/#Comment_438414" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T05:10:01+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  5:10AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>In the Fate Core supplement Worlds on Fire, Jason Morningstar has a game called<i> Fight Fire </i>that is basically this.</blockquote>\nMentioned in the OP. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nD'oh!

Nice and climactic for a firefighter: models someone throwing away their life to save someone else, only to come out with so much smoke damage to their lungs (or whatever) that they collapse and we have a little teary "saying goodbye" scene as they're carted to the hospital.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438484/#Comment_438484" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T21:19:03+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  9:19PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most important question is to make sure you have an answer for "why not escalate straight to d10?", I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438490/#Comment_438490" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T23:27:25+00:00" title="September 17, 2014 11:27PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3:16 carnage among the flames!

You'd have to play with the design parameters to make sure this remains a meaningful choice.<br/><br/>But the basic idea is that, just like in Dogs, you (ideally) want to resolve each conflict/fire/threat with the least amount of escalation possible. <br/><br/>Escalation should be frightening and risky, and drain resources as well as endanger the firefighters.<br/><br/>Here's a real-life example: there was a fire one morning on the roof of my apartment building. Someone had left a BBQ burning, and by the morning it got so hot that some coals fell out of it onto the wooden deck and started a fire. By the time the firefighters got there, there was a serious fire going on, localized around the BBQ. <br/><br/>One firefighter decided to approach the BBQ to see if he could get to the source of the fire. At that moment, the propane tank exploded. He was quite severely injured. Now his colleagues had to come rescue him from the fire!<br/><br/>I would want steps like approaching the fire, or moving in to rescue a comrade, to be part of the escalation - you're engaging more and more intimately and physically with the threat, in other words. The first stage might be scoping things out from a distance, or maybe firing a hose at the flames from a safe distance. The final stage would be using your hands: like when you rush in to pull a victim out of the flames with your own hands.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438497/#Comment_438497" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T07:04:20+00:00" title="September 18, 2014  7:04AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2014 7:05AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not feeling the Dogs model, personally.

If you want to strain the 'ethics ~= tactics' metaphor, d10 tactics in a firefight are likely to increase property damage (in addition to increasing failure risk with d10 fallout often leading to death/disfigurement).<br/><br/>But all that said... Jason is right: DitV is a big, big stretch to res-kin as firefighting.

(So, perhaps if the fire spreads to the kitchen of the house, that's like when you get to roll in your Will because you're escalating.)<br/><br/>Escalation for the firefighters would be a simple matter of how deep you're willing to go and how you're willing to risk your own life and/or equipment/tools/resources/collateral damage/other people.<br/><br/>Then certain rooms/areas and particular situations would have Traits attached to them. For instance, maybe the basement has a propane tank in it, which we rate 2d8 (or whatever). If the fire spreads to the basement, the GM can bring that into play and roll in those dice. Maybe another Trait is something like "the rain stops", which would only be called in if the fire continues past a certain hour. (I don't actually know if that makes much of a difference, I'm just brainstorming here - but situational conditions could be brought in as Traits very nicely this way.)<br/><br/>As a firefighter, you don't necessarily know where these dangers are, but acting smart could allow you to figure it out beforehand, and then you might try to divert the fire from sensitive areas or prevent something you're worried about.<br/><br/>Relationships and belongings would already work well: you get to roll in Relationship dice when one of your Relationships is at stake. This could interface nicely with the GM's rules for creating dangerous fires (or whatever crises) in the first place - the firefighters' Relationships would help create the scene, and we'd often want to be able to pull in crises which affect people the firefighters care about.<br/><br/>What I like about this is the way the dice give the GM a clear way to resolve the outcome of the fire. (Something like Apocalypse World doesn't give the GM much support in deciding when a particular situation is dealt with, if challenging the players is the goal.)<br/><br/>I think Fallout (and the way injuries work in Dogs) would be a great fit for this game, too.<br/><br/>But, anyway, I'll shut up now! I'm just thinking out loud.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109" title="icemaster109"><img alt="icemaster109" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109">icemaster109</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438508/#Comment_438508" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T12:43:12+00:00" title="September 18, 2014 12:43PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2014 12:46PM by icemaster109.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So after reading this, watching some documentaries, reading some books about firefighters, and browsing a couple of games at the FLGS. I wanted to address a couple of ideas I've seen here. <br/><br/><b>On FATE </b>: So I took a good long look at this setting and the system mechanics, and as much as I dislike FATE, I have to admit there was a ton of great information. Equipment, firefighting theory, and some great inspiration was found in this setting. My big problem (really it's my player's problem) with FATE is <i>Aspects</i>. My players just hated them. They felt it was too handwavey, that certain players would really argue or finagle their aspects into use, while others stayed silently confused or unsure of he mechanic. Likewise the idea of aspects was too hard for many new players to grasp. A couple of games in - you would see the lightbulb click in a new players head. ("Ohh I should have made <i>this</i> an aspect") Lastly, aspects take a lot of thought and FATE character creation seemed to run slow and muddy as everyone tries to get on the same page. My players ADD, they want to plug-n-play. <br/><br/><b>On Dogs in the Vineyard</b>: The idea is intriguing. Especially fallout. But as an above poster said, I have a tough time seeing the morality based mechanics as a means to tactically approach fires. My big kicker against DitV is that I'll be running 6-7 players. DitV really doesn't do well past 4.<br/><br/><b>On Flash Point + an added drama system</b>: I'm really leaning in this direction. Flash Point seems like it has some fun and intriguing fire fighting mechanics. It seems like I could easily tack on a drama system for between scenario drama and we could logically have a campaign going. My two biggest hurdles are - 1: What do I do for maps. I know they have a couple they have produced. However what do I do when I run out of the 8 or so maps. Are there fan made ones? Can I make my own? I just don't know.  2: Everything is bright and vibrant in Flash Point. You literally start off with a schematic of where everything is in a given building. That kind of takes away the fear, tension, and darkness that seems to go hand-n-hand with firefighting. <br/><br/><b>On Apocalypse World</b>: There seems to be something waiting in the system for it. The relationship mechanics and the idea of winning but with a cost or stipulation seem like it be a prime candidate for a firefighting game. However I just don't know the system well enough. I've only read through it once. Moves and stats are something that I am far from being able to come up with given my limited experience. <br/><br/><b>My conclusion</b>: Right now Flash Point is taking the lead. However, I'm now open to the idea of using a <i>horror system</i>. One where smoke can creep up on you, fire can break through and claim you, and where a bad decision can have you falling through a roof ? And after the fire you carry the psychological impact of those mistakes. Can anyone recommend me something in that area maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109" title="icemaster109"><img alt="icemaster109" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109">icemaster109</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438510/#Comment_438510" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T13:26:05+00:00" title="September 18, 2014  1:26PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of horor, I did see some of you mention <b>Dread</b>. I might be able to work with that. If there was a way to add a level of tactics over it. A couple of ideas I've had so far....<br/><br/>1. The tower represents the actual building. If you aren't in the building and it "comes down" - you are safe. If you are in the building you, you will die/injured. Hell, maybe <i>everyone in the building</i> has a chance to die or become injured if it comes down. I think that really hypes the player up everytime they step in the building. <br/><br/>2. Every level you up or room deeper is an added action for you to go back down or escape. So the higher/deeper you go, the more you <i>commit</i>. You can't "jump" out of a building as quickly when your deeper in. So if it gets shakey - you have to run all the way out. <br/><br/>3. A friend of mine likes the idea of wedging player cards on certain levels. If a tower partially collapses, but your card is still wedged in that may mean your safe from that collapsed area. I'm not sure how feasible this would be in play. <br/><br/>4. The players have actions, tactics, techniques that can put blocks back in the tower to add stability. Again, just like in real life, your attempt to "fix" a fire can still cause it to go awry and "fall". Other actions would simply stop a pull from being taken all together. So because you did X, you saved yourself from dealing with Y. <br/><br/>5. I will make my players play this in the dark/dim and with flashlights. Pulling jenga with flashlights! <br/><br/>A couple of things I'd want to add though....<span style="text-decoration: underline;">any suggestions would be welcomed</span>. <br/><br/>-A system for fires: Jenga blocks need to be already pulled and continued to be pulled as things go bad and burn. After awhile the player interaction would put enough stress on it I think to make it exciting. Any ideas?<br/>-Specializations/Actions: So players can feel like there character is meaningful. <br/>-An incentive to keep "running in" and rescuing people or fighting the fire. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438511/#Comment_438511" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T13:39:31+00:00" title="September 18, 2014  1:39PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2014 1:44PM by Nathan_H.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be cool to hide objectives in the Tower, like marbles or small dice.
