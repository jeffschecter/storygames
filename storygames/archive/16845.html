But really, there's a lot of things that just make sense. <br/><br/>First off, <i>Adventure Time</i> is basically an old-school fantasy game about half the time and a dungeon crawl every several episodes. Pretty much all Finn and Jake do is chill out and go on quests.<br/><br/>Second, the character funnel would be brilliant for <i>Adventure Time</i>. You come up with a bunch of 0-level peasants. Roll up a couple of people from the Candy Kingdom, maybe someone from Lumpy Space, maybe one of Party Pat's Bears and see which one of them makes it out the dungeon in the episode "Dungeon". <br/><br/>Third, there are four seasons worth of pre-generated NPCs and royalty to interact with (all the princesses!) and more villains than you could shake a stick at (or poke them in the eye with).<br/><br/>Fourth, while you might have to tweak the races, you wouldn't really have to do anything with the classes. Pretty much anything goes in <i>Adventure Time</i>.<br/><br/>Fifth, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrdGSZJ4mlU" rel="nofollow">Magic Man</a> could show up. *shudder*<br/><br/>I think this needs to happen. I'll write more later.<br/><br/><i>Edit Edit:</i> Oh! I almost forgot one of the most important reasons for using DCC! Because DCC uses Zocchi dice, and Zocchi dice are even more <i>MATHEMATICAL!</i><br/><br/><i>Edit Edit Edit:</i> "You find the Gauntlet of Billy!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
