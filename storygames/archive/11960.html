They\u2019ve since merged, split up, mixed back together, moved away or gotten too busy to game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs adults they have Shadowrun like jobs... computer hacker security experts, martial art instructors, forensics, special ops, government intelligence agents, elf posers, and peyote smoking ghost dancing mages. Ok maybe not the last 2. But not for lack of trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\u2019re getting back together in the next few months to run a few games. They want to play Shadowrun. But they dislike the Shadowrun system.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of them dig elements of Mouse Guard so I\u2019ve hacked together a Frankenstein amalgamation of a stripped down Shadowrun 4, Mouse Guard, PTA, and Blackout.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played a few times and it\u2019s pretty neat. The GM creates obstacles like a Producer in PTA but instead of spending budget they increase how much money the mission is worth (you can even use money tokens as hit points on the obstacles). And every 1 on a d6 the players roll causes Glitches the GM can spend for special effects regardless if they fail or succeed (they usually succeed but with fun complications). And a whole lot more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, they are wicked smart! They out think most situations. Last game they purposely failed the mission, used the failure to get paid twice, double crossed their employers, and perfectly covered everything up. They even tricked their employer into giving them a 5 star review on ShadowTweetBook before the double cross. I was blown away by their adeptness. This is why they get paid big bucks in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had a blast so it\u2019s not a major problem. But they also expressed they don\u2019t want to get away with double crossing employers all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe since made it so the GM can spend Glitches to leave evidence behind. Which has helped. Even though the players may describe everything perfectly, the unexpected can still occur. And it\u2019s fun figuring out how that happened or what they missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also mentioned they are essentially playing as themselves rather than as their characters. Obviously their characters don\u2019t exist. But if they were in their characters positions, they wouldn\u2019t be a Shadowrunners. They would get a day job. So we need to bake into their characters reasons why they have to be Shadowrunners and why they can\u2019t just get a day job. And use those reasons to make them more fuckups or victims who have no choice but to Shadowrun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey even discussed coming up with some sort of character detail that explains why they can\u2019t hold onto their money for long vs. saving it away. Even if they can think of ways to get out of the Shadowrun life, they want something that keeps them there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still have the problem of figuring out why you would bother Shadowrunning if you can simply hack people\u2019s bank accounts. Even if we made it incredibly hard to do so (although hard is relative as Shadowrunners are essentially hired for those exact skills) there is still the issue of mind control. You can use magic to get targets to transfer money into your credtsick. Which gets boring quickly. But these are heavy immersion players and want in fiction reasons to patch these loopholes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267365/#Comment_267365" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T18:11:06+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  6:11PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br><br>Man alive, I want to make sweet sweet babytime with this post.<br><br>- Ryan                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267366/#Comment_267366" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T18:11:59+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  6:11PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>We still have the problem of figuring out why you would bother Shadowrunning if you can simply hack people\u2019s bank accounts.

Senator Rourke is advocating the re-introduction of a paper currency, and the gradual removal of digital banking options.<br><br>Rourke's plan has been attacked as been archaic, over-reactive, environmentally unfriendly and generally unmanageable. Still, it's gaining credence amongst many US politicians, some of whom have lost billions to incidents of digital fraud.<br><br>It seems like support for Bill C52 hinges upon the collective decision-making of several prominent Las Vegas casinos, who the media have latched onto as a "litmus test" for assessing support and viability of this radical, luddite plan.<br><br>If it goes through, the world of digital security will undergo radical changes. Digital fraud will be effectively un-invented, while digitally-assisted physical theft will likely see a major rise.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267378/#Comment_267378" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T19:14:27+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  7:14PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have nothing to add except SRD PDF kplzthx                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267379/#Comment_267379" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T19:20:15+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  7:20PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have nothing to add except that I've seen character sheets for Shadow Guard.

He hacked his way into the big accounts of one of the Corps -- sources vary which it was. Made himself a cool 100 mil. Never really got the chance to enjoy it, mind you. You know why 'runners don't make a living hacking Corps and anyone else with a big stack of nuyen? Because Corps can hire 'runners. Other 'runners. Older 'runners, with better gear and bigger guns. They say DocWagon sent out a Tac-squad when Smoove's bracelet started to flash, but by the time they got there, his arm had been chopped off and dropped down a manhole. His tongue was sent by courier to his mama, back east; his other hand to his old 'runner squad. Nobody ever found the rest of him. No sir, not worth the trouble.<br><br>Not to mention the fallout for his team: blacklisted, the lot of them. No Johnson worth his salt touches them now. They run the odd leg-break for local crime syndicates, but nothing big, nothing worth any real cheese. Sad, really.

They have armchair discussions about all the stuff "you could do" in the setting, given the tech-level or magic or whatever. It's always pretty theoretical and ignores the obvious: in a world with mind-control magic (for example), institutions either implement policies and procedures to deal with it, or they go under.

Are you using Rewards? Traits?</blockquote>\nBeliefs, Goals, Traits, and Rewards were indeed in play (no Instincts). <br/><br/>They played and were rewarded for their Beliefs. But the content of the beliefs were part of the problem. As many people mentioned above, we made the game all about the Nuyen (money). And many of the beliefs matched that which is part of the problem. Different Beliefs (while still staying within Shadowrun\u2019s theme) would have helped immensely. In some ways, it all worked perfectly and predictably. <br/><br/>Goals were trickier. Only one person earned Persona for completing their goal. But anyone\u2019s goal that relied on completing the mission was not rewarded. Also, the MVP reward was not awarded since it goes to the person who is crucial to completing the mission.<br/><br/>This is further complicated by money again. Getting more money was more valuable to them than earning a Persona point. Adding more money (or NPC bribing the players with gear) throws off the other currencies in play. Especially since these guys are so ruthless. They\u2019ve played Mouse Guard perfectly and are pretty good at weighing the value of rewards against each other. <br/><br/>In Mouse Guard, missions align with the mouse guard\u2019s purpose. In Shadowrun, missions are a means of getting money. <br/><br/>And I have to reply this hilarious post\u2026\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>What year do these maniacs think it is?

Shadowrunners do get paid in untraceable Nuyen which is another reason why the day job doesn\u2019t work since it would start to leave a paper trail and why stealing money is much less desirable. I will definitely play this up next time. <br/><br/>There are also criminal organizations that will convert regular Nuyen or corporate specific Nuyen to untraceable neutral Nuyen.

I'm looking forward to hearing more. And the replies in this thread have been great to read, too.<br/><br/>A question:<br/><br/>You say these guys were really smart and got away with all sorts of crap. How did they accomplish their awesomeness? Was it "roleplay/plan well enough not to roll the dice", a la old-school D&amp;D, or cleverly manipulating the mechanics, or some combination?<br/><br/>As for the money troubles, the first thing that came to mind was a little more mundane. You know how your expenses on your credit card, etc, are insurable? Well, maybe in ShadowMouse world, pretty much all "legal" sources of money are insured in some clever way. With digital money it could be as simple as "you get the money returned to you by the insurance company, and now the money that was taken is no longer good." So, the Shadowmice only want to go after money that's uninsured--and that's going to be black market, sketchy stuff.<br/><br/>One easy way to create Shadowmice: whatever their skills are, those *used to be* their dayjob, but now have suddenly become totally obsolete, because something big has just suddenly changed. Like, say, people of a certain racial background are suddenly never hired by the MegaCorp that employs all specialists of a certain profession, because of some genetic detail they all share and the Corp considers a liability? (Or so they say, anyway.)<br/><br/>The "Robin Hood" solution is another one: they're too honest to steal from the banks and random people. But getting it from criminals (whether mafia or Microsoft, whoever they don't think deserve their wealth) is a different story.<br/><br/>I also agree with Luke that accumulation of wealth is kinda boring. I'd want a game like this to have some huge hole for the characters to sink their money into. Like blood debts to a mafia boss (e.g. Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt), or a daughter who's dying and can't afford medical treatment, or whatever. So that they're constantly having to figure how much money they can afford to keep in order to repair their gear and improve their chances of success on their *next* job, and how much they want to spend to actually have a shot at this thing they care about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267528/#Comment_267528" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T14:25:48+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  2:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2010 2:26PM by Johnstone.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>Lifestyle in SR was a joke.

The game was all about money, and they quickly had loads of it. When I ran it again years later, I re-calibrated things a bit.<br/><br/>The SINless are valuable as runners, but you can't pay them in money. All nuyen is traceable (like Jackson said), and requires a SIN to use. So they get paid in goods from clients and loot from missions.<br/><br/>This boiled down to them essentially deciding if they wanted to get paid in lifestyle goods (food, clothes, booze, a new car, etc.) or mission gear (ammo, software, new guns) and then negotiating appropriately. Almost everything they got was expendable, which was the point. It was basically impossible for them to get ahead or build a retirement nest egg just by doing runs. They lived run to run, and sometimes had piles of weird loot to deal with (what are we gonna do with all of these shoes?).<br/><br/>Fortunately for the hack, the MG resource system works perfectly for this method. And, once the game isn't about getting super-rich, it has to be about something else. Specifically, why are you obsessed with sticking it to the corporations? What do you believe in?<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>:</b> We're not in the same game, no.

But even that wasn't enough. Lifestyle in SR was a joke. Stuff never cost enough. Shadowrunners never had enough expenses. Guys like this, they never get rich. They make enough to stay alive, but they keep doing it for the thrill. Shadowrun never captured that for me. My group definitely did for the thrill, but they were filthy rich. That always rang hollow for me.</blockquote>\nI\u2019m certain my players agree with you about SR. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t want to use the SR system. <br/><br/>Some of their complaints were that legwork, money/lifestyle, and contacts didn\u2019t matter enough. Legwork was easily solved by using successful tests to generate bonus dice or tools for future rolls and to have a space on the character sheet to note these bonuses (one player said\u2026 if it\u2019s on the character sheet, it\u2019s important, which is why we made space for the other PCs\u2019 names). <br/><br/>But they especially wanted it to be all about money. So we made the need for money high. Want to heal major conditions? Money. Want to get people to help you who aren\u2019t contacts? Money (which also made contacts crucial). Want to upkeep your lifestyle so you don\u2019t suffer a condition? Money. And Money is partly XP since you need it for gear, cyberware, bioware, and spells.<br/><br/>And it worked. They desperately wanted money and were excited when they got it. But it got to the point where they would do anything for money. Which they loved. It rang true to how they wanted Shadowrun to feel. But it starts to encourage sociopathic behavior. <br/><br/>Having meaningful personal goals that make you more human could help. Maybe a reputation system. If your reputation goes down from acting insane, the only people who will hire you demand discount prices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267534/#Comment_267534" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T14:48:43+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  2:48PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>:</b> Definitely a combination of roleplay around situations (still rolling but gaining every advantage possible) and building characters with a diversity of assets to cover their bases.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like your idea of having legal sources of money insured so if you steal it, it becomes valueless in a short period of time (like credit cards now).

When a corporation or other sponsor needs someone to do dirty work, they look to the shadows. As \u201cdeniable assets,\u201d runners make advantageous\u2014and expendable\u2014tools. <br><br>Runners have contacts, who represent other potentially useful people they know. Some of these will be other underworld types, such as gang members or hit men. Others may be ordinary people, useful for information or for \u201cspecial arrangements\u201d\u2014 for example, the corporate secretary who lets you know when the wiz research scientist you\u2019re supposed to kidnap will be leaving the building. The more you rely on any particular contact\u2019s skills, information, and resources, the more you\u2019ll owe them in the end\u2014even between long-standing contacts, money and favors are usually necessary to grease the wheels. A player character\u2019s relationship with a contact need not be friendly. Sometimes, the people that can help you out the most are those you like the least. The most important contact for shadowrunners is the fixer. A fixer acts as a middleman and can usually help the runners find gear, other contacts or work\u2014all for a fee, of course. A corporation or other employer that needs shadowrunners sends someone to a fixer to ask for recommendations. If a team of runners has a good reputation and meets the job requirements, a meeting is arranged to discuss details and haggle over payment. Because such matters are highly sensitive, anonymity is par for the course, and employers of this type are known simply as Mr. Johnson.<br><br>Mr. Johnson may not always be a corporate representative. The world of Shadowrun is rich and complex, with many people and groups who may need to hire runners to accomplish certain goals. A criminal syndicate may hire runners to strike at rivals, a mage may hire them to acquire certain rare materials for magic use, or Joe Neighbor may need to find the terrorists who kidnapped his wife. Regardless of the sponsor, if a job involves doing something dangerous and potentially illegal, it\u2019s a shadowrun. Just like Mr. Johnson is anonymous, so may be the sponsor\u2014if the price is right, most running teams don\u2019t care who\u2019s paying. Misdirection is common, and Johnsons will often try to drop false clues, leading \u2019runners to think that they\u2019re actually employed by someone else entirely. Shadowrunner teams may even take the initiative, doing jobs of their own accord. For example, a player character may hold a grudge against a certain megacorp, or dislike how a certain gang treats people in his neighborhood. Maybe he decides it\u2019s time to get his criminal record erased. Other jobs may be politically or socially motivated; the character or runner team may be members of or regularly work with far left or far right political groups. In the Sixth World, everyone has dirty work that needs doing.<br/><br/>Runners accomplish their tasks by working the streets for information, calling in favors and markers from friends and contacts in the shadows. They take whatever action their job requires: surveillance, theft, breaking and entering, even murder.<br/><br/>Runners do these things because they are survivors. Many of them grew up committing crimes to get by, or perhaps they obtained special training somewhere and want to put it to use. Some may have extended families to feed and no other source of income. Many of them prefer the freedom of the shadowlife, controlling their own destinies as opposed to being a wage slave in some drab business park kissing corporate ass all day. Others enjoy the thrill of running, thriving on its risks. Finally, some are inspired to run by a sense of social justice; they want to damage the powers-that-be however they can while providing for the underclass. These runners are known as \u2019hooders for their Robin Hood outlook.</br></br></br></br></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267537/#Comment_267537" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T15:23:22+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  3:23PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I see where I made a crucial mistake. <br/><br/>I forgot that Fixers act as middleman between the PCs and Mr. Johnson.

The Watchers could be anyone. In our world, the Watchers are certain parts of the FBI, Interpol, the NSA. In the Sixth World, the Watchers are probably even worse. I mean, imagine you run the FBI and think about what you could do with those assets. Now... imagine you are Lofwyr. Or Deus. Some of these watchers will want justice. Some will want the wealth. Plan accordingly.<br/><br/>Second: It seems to me the amassing of wealth in SR inexorably leads to a "second stage" of shadowrunner: one who <i>must</i> become a participant in corporate politics to remain alive. Where SR as written "rings hollow" is that it assumes that once a runner, always a runner. It's no surprise that your players find it hard to come up with reasons why they should remain runners. Being a runner is intended to be a stepping stone to <i>something else</i>: retiring to a tropical island, becoming a crime lord, running a company, taking over a country. SR isn't built for that at all, nor are most of the games you hacked together. In other words, once SR players get that wealthy, they've effectively "won" Shadowrun and the game is over. If you want to take it to the next level, you are playing a much different game. (That could be quite a cool game, but it wouldn't be Shadowrun.)<br/><br/>If, once you reach the point where you are wealthy enough to reach that "something else", you want to keep playing SR its only possible if the characters choose not to grab the brass ring. And such "failure to graduate" can only end in one of the following ways:<br/><br/>1) Someone takes what you have from you.<br/>2) Your personal foibles undermine you, causing you relinquish what you have.<br/>3) You die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267815/#Comment_267815" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T10:39:04+00:00" title="April 19, 2010 10:39AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that could be the next stage of the game:<br/><br/>You're rich?

The gist of it being that upward class mobility is extremely unstable until it persists for several generations -- if you are middle class but your parents are poor, it generally takes very little for you to end up lower class again. This has to do with all sorts of reasons, of course.<br/><br/>But the connection to Shadowrun is probably more easily made by referencing the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m37JkkGjAY&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">Chris Rock routine about the difference between being "rich" and "wealthy"</a>. These Shadowrunners of yours may be getting rich, but are they getting wealthy? <br/><br/>I don't think so, at least not based on what people are saying in this thread about their social position. If Shadowrunners really are SINless &amp; therefore disenfranchised from society in all the ways that represents, what means could they possibly have for becoming wealthy? You can't get wealthy if you have to keep all your money in the form of mattress-stuffed bills; you can't get wealthy if nobody will let you invest in their company, if nobody will let you open a bank account.<br/><br/>And you sure as hell can't get wealthy if anybody who is wealthy can just up and take all your money one day and you lack any legal or social power whatsoever to do anything about it. Because as soon as you get rich enough? Somebody with real money is going to do that. That's how they stay wealthy! <br/><br/>The whole point of being a Shadowrunner is that your only means of reliable income is running. You can keep stuffing your mattress, but the mattress isn't paying dividends. And how hard is it to loot a mattress? Oh but maybe you can hire someone to guard your mattress, but see above about what exactly you are going to do when Mr. Wealthy Mattress Mogul decides that those are actually all his giant piles of cash. What are you going to do, sue him? Get the cops after him? Or are you going to strap on the old gear and start all over again, with a new target?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267846/#Comment_267846" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T13:22:27+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  1:22PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>You can't get wealthy if you have to keep all your money in the form of mattress-stuffed bills; you can't get wealthy if nobody will let you invest in their company, if nobody will let you open a bank account.</blockquote>\nWell, I think you actually can, and that's called organized crime.<br/><br/>Which is lovely, for jenskot.

It makes money off institutional, established, repeatable crimes like drug-dealing or whatever. The Mafia does not rob banks for a living, though they may rob some banks. And of course they have elaborate money laundering schemes -- that's really the important transition, it's what allows them to turn their riches into wealth.

Seriously. Some excerpts:\n<blockquote><b>Why Crime?</b><br/><i>"Why yes, Big Brother is watching. However Big Brother has ADHD, so I'm going to sit here drinking my soykaf like any of a billion wage slaves are doing right now. And then Big Brother will get bored. And distracted. And then I'm going to do\u2026 anything I want."</i><br/><br/>One of the core conceits of the Shadowrun game is that crime is possible, and that crime pays. Given the wealth of potential satellite oversight (just look at Google Earth in 2007 \u2013 imagine the law enforcement version in 2070), and the incredibly daunting task that is cracking through somewhat decent encryption, it is entirely reasonable to project a future where getting away with any crime at all requires some sort of elaborate social engineering to pull inside jobs that play off of secret limits of the anti-crime system. But this isn't Minority Report or any other Phildickian setup, this is Shadowrun. And in Shadowrun: bad people shoot other people right in the face for money and get away with it to do it again.<br/><br/>So here are some quasi-plausible justifications for that: </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Throughout human history the creation of data has exceeded the capacity to store it. It starts in infancy where a babe simply doesn't remember every single thing she sees, and it continues on through the Age of Bronze where not every conversation or every play gets written down, and it continues today. It could very plausibly continue in the Shadowrun future and for the sake of playability we're assuming that it does. The cameras in the world exceed the number of people who could watch them, and they collectively generate more video footage every day than can be stored on all the world's storage media.<br/><br/>And that is amongst the things that makes crime possible. When you go to the bathroom, a computer is measuring the mass of your deposit. When you flee a crime scene you're being watched by every store front you pass. But likely as not, none of that information will actually be saved anywhere. Some of it may be, but it quite likely isn't organized enough to actually identify you as the perpetrator (of the crime or the leavings). More importantly, information getting deleted isn't really news. If 18\xbd minutes are missing or overwritten by elven pornography, that's not weird. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Your SIN, your driver's license, your home owner's insurance, your medical records, and really every other thing about you are stored electronically in the Matrix. It's like your credit report today. And like your credit report (or wikipedia), pretty much anyone can put stuff into the data stream at any time. You can challenge the data in court and maybe get it changed, but by and large stuff just accumulates in the data stream. Because of the fact that things aren't always correct and some people are total tools, the system is equipped with failsafes to try to weed out incorrect data. Data which is repeated many times in many places (or in important or "trustworthy" places) is considered to have a high veracity. Data which shows up only a few times or in very sketchy places is treated as having a lower veracity. If data conflicts, the system automatically chooses to believe higher veracity information at the expense of lower veracity information. <br/><br/>...This can be used by criminals (that's you). Because of the complete lack of a central authority of Truth\xa9, you can actually create truths that happen to suit you. If you treat something as true long and loudly enough, everyone else will treat it the same way. While archaic considerations like "statute of limitations" are out the window, the fact is that if you can fool the world into believing that you've always lived in Nag Kampuchea for a while, the world will continue to believe it pretty much indefinitely. The world of 2071 has an extremely short attention span and you actually can reinvent yourself with sufficient effort. </blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>Why Money?</b><br/><i>\u201cWhy rob a bank? That's where the money is.\u201d</i><br/><br/>Perhaps the most extraordinary claim of all in the annals of hackerdom is the idea that these people get paid in electronic currency to break the laws of society and change electronic records. The extremity of this claim is quite apparent: people are breaking the rules of society to change data records in exchange for being gifted with data records that according to the rules of society entitle them to goods and services. Why not eliminate the middle man and just hack the money records directly? The fact that people in the Shadowrun universe don't is highly indicative that they can't. And the reason for this is primarily because the monetary records themselves are very far away. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268076/#Comment_268076" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T10:15:41+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 10:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Debits and Credits: Debt Slavery and the Credit Spiral</b><br/><i>\u201cWork your fingers to the bone and what do you get? Bony fingers!\u201d</i><br/><br/>An interesting thing that happens in Shadowrun is that despite the fact that the characters are getting a brand new identity several times a month in some cases, they still feel the need to work for a living. And that's actually somewhat odd when you think about it in terms of modern finances. See in 2008 \u201cyou\u201d can borrow fairly substantial sums of money at any time at merely ruinous interest with no collateral. The threat of destroying the credit rating of your identity is considered sufficient of a stick to make these short term loan sharking operations solvent. In 2008, identity fraud comes with a certain amount of cash money automatically. Simply by virtue of trading the credit rating in for cash advances on loans that one has no intention of repaying, someone who is already committing the crime of fraud on their identity can gain a steady income from sketchy banks and loan houses until one is caught for the first offense.<br/><br/>And yet, in Shadowrun that manifestly doesn't happen, because the characters are perjuring their identities again and again and they are paying money for the privilege instead of vice versa. What does this mean? It means that the credit system in Shadowrun is somehow set up so that taking a loan with an identity that is going to cease to exist long before the first payment comes due is not a no brainer. In fact, it seems that taking a loan is itself so onerous that characters just are not doing it at all \u2013 even though the campaign only takes place over a short period of the character's life and thus can be looked at as being in the disposable ID situation even if the character is a SINner. See, the campaign is likely going to end in a year of the character's life, so anything she ever has to repay at any interest in 13 months is just flavor text in any \u201creal\u201d sense. And yet, players just don't take loans. They spend money that they have already earned rather than drawing on the reserves of a speculative future to gain monetary advantages during the actual game.<br/><br/>The primary reason for this is probably linked directly to the reason that people call corp workers \u201cwage slaves.\u201d See, when you take a loan in 2071 you don't just get a pile of money that you are expected to pay back. You actually sign up for employment and the corp gives you an advance on your wages. Wage slaves literally are slaves. Or indentured servants. Or whatever. They work for nothing except food and board, occasionally having the number of required work hours they are required to put in go up. And that's why player characters don't usually take loans \u2013 they would actually have to show up for work in order to get the money. Which is really just like their current job as freelance mercenaries except less awesome.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268078/#Comment_268078" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T10:22:51+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 10:22AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>Just read<a href="http://tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=48836" rel="nofollow">The Ends</a>, okay?

Like "More data then will be stored" thing for example: With Storage becoming cheaper, faster and generally BETTER, the idea that runs are possible because most data isn't stored rings hollow to me. It seems much more likely, to me, that our ability to actually sift through all that data and work with it will be dwarfed by our storage space. Same result but the way to get there seems more logical to me.<br/><br/>Same with, for example, the encryption chapter. Now, I confess to being something of a crypto nerd, at least in my own amateur fashion, but some of the stuff there just rings false. (And some is just painfull, like the way they use "Cypher" when they mean "Key".)<br/><br/>Still, awesome stuff there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Running Shadowrun for \u201creal life Shadowrunners\u201d is hard! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11960/running-shadowrun-for-real-life-shadowrunners-is-hard/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Running Shadowrun for \u201creal life Shadowrunners\u201d is hard! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11960/running-shadowrun-for-real-life-shadowrunners-is-hard/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: John HarperMy character sheet and initial MG/SR hack notes are here.

The last time I really played Shadowrun regularly - probably 1991-93ish - I had a rocker character who started out with a fairly sizable loan from the Mafia to pay for a bunch of stuff that I probably didn't need, but sounded cool. Session ends would usually go something like this.<br/><br/>"Okay, I know I still owe you 400,000 nuyen, but the job went really well, so I can give you a hundred thousand of that this week!"<br/><br/>"Ah, so nice. So that means *calculator noises* only 380,000 to go. Sound right?"<br/><br/>"Um. But. Yeah.

And this is with people who hate game theory or taking games too seriously. It was bizarre and fascinating to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 person, who just came back from Iraq, stood up and tried to physically illustrate how all the rules would work in real life and re-enacted scenes from the game!!! He took the game's gear list and re-wrote large parts of it from scratch. Another person started discussing how the rules would need to change to capture the feeling of their favorite books or movies which had very little to do with real life. Another person started talking about how we needed more abstraction and game resources that they can tactically manipulate like a board game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was insane! I barely spoke and I'm pretty sure I didn't inspire the conversation directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur friend who was trying to make the game realistic wrote down a list of variables we would need to make it work. And it was a very, very long list. Then after back and forth he came to the conclusion that what you really need to know is what someone wants, what's in their way, what's helping them, what's at risk, and how are they trying to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else was making a case that combat needs its own system and that's its more complicated than hacking or persuading someone. Someone else then referenced a few books on hacking and negotiations and concluded that its all about perception. The more you know about a subject, the more is involved. It depends who is playing if you're talking about realism. And it will never be realistic only perceived as such. And perception is relative.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this led them to the conclusion that the GM can't be the one to set difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne person who just came back from combat training preferred an abstract system of glitches rather than having rules for reloading or other weapon inefficiencies or obstructions. His point is that a lot of people spend too much time talking about issues with ammo and there are so many more issues to consider that could go wrong. It came back again to its situational, depends on perception, and the depends on the group as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conversation swung from "we need a 1,000 page book of rules or a computer to crunch all the variables" to "even if you had that it would probably be wrong anyway because wrong is situational based on experience and expectations."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was really interesting. I had a lot of fun just watching!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272026/#Comment_272026" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T11:05:49+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 11:05AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!<br><br>That's a lot of ground to cover in three hours.

We've already made it so the GM doesn't track much or roll for anything. The players roll determines who successful they are, their opponent is, and what consequences emerge from that action. <br/><br/>We talked more about setting difficulties by group consensus. We tried out a few things and this worked reasonably well...<br/><br/>Assume all default difficulties are Hard. And what Hard means mechanically will depend on the number of players. The more players, the harder Hard is. <br/><br/>GM sets obstacle. Players steps up to solve the obstacles and explains how. <br/><br/>GM asks (at first, later this should become habit requiring no prompting) if everyone thinks they will likely succeed. If everyone else (and the GM) think the player will likely succeed, they hand them a die. Otherwise, they slide a Money token into the money pool. The more people that think you will succeed, the more dice you have, effectively lowering the difficulty (which starts Hard) without actually lowering the difficulty. If they don't think you will succeed, then the mission is harder than expected, and is worth more Money at the end if the players complete the mission. <br/><br/>This worked really, really well. What was even more awesome, if someone is unclear on what a player is doing and how (and thus not sure to give them a die or increase the mission's Money), they are encouraged to ask the player to go into more detail. Which helped clarify the fiction and get everyone more invested. And the GM isn't even always the driving force!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272465/#Comment_272465" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T06:24:16+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  6:24AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds very cool, John!<br/><br/>Tell me more about these "consequences".

Here is what we playstormed (which is very different than what we played when I started this thread which was more Mouse Guard like). <br/><br/>Roll a D6 die pool drawing dice from Abilities, Traits, and Linked Help Tests. 4,5,6 = Hit. 1,2,3 = Miss. 1 also = Glitch. <br/><br/>The number of Hits you need depends on the number of players at the table. Base difficulty scales because the more people playing, the more they can affect the difficulty. Players (GM included) affect the difficulty by simply passing you an extra die if they think what you are describing is plausible and would likely succeed. Every person who doesn't pass you a die, increases the mission Money pool by 1.<br/><br/>Any extra Hits beyond meeting the difficulty may be spent to increase the effect of the roll. There is a list of options on the character sheet. You may also spend Hits to cancel Glitches. So you can go all out and do crazy amounts of damage but have consequences or you act carefully and use some Hits to remove Glitches. But... time is of the essence... the longer the mission, the less Money it is worth (remove 1 Money from the Money pool after everyone takes a turn).<br/><br/>Gear gives you free Hits but Cyberware is extra Glitchy making it so that any Glitches you roll are doubled. <br/><br/>If you fail a roll, you can give the GM a number of additional Gltches = to the number of Hits you failed by or burn out the Gear you were using or in some cases spend Money or you can just fail. <br/><br/>Also, after you are out of minor wounds and armor, you start taking major wounds which increases how many dice you roll BUT increases how many Glitches rolling a 1 generates. So it's a different kind of death spiral. You are still effective... in some ways more effective as you take damage... but you generate more consequences. <br/><br/>The GM doesn't roll for Threats (NPCs). They simply spend the Glitches just rolled for effects. The GM can use Glitches to cause a piece of Gear to jam or you need to reload a gun or you are disarmed or take damage or a new Threat is spawned (with Hit Points equal to the number of Glitches spent) or a whole wonderful list of bad stuff including the player being capture or leaving evidence / loose ends behind (which subtracts Money from the mission if it isn't cleaned up). <br/><br/>The GM may also introduce new Threats by increasing the mission's Money by the number of Hit Points of the new Threat. Glitches allow the GM to do this without making the mission worth more money. <br/><br/>Threats can be anything from NPCs to chase scenes to bomb countdowns to new twists to bad reputation to evidence of you that can come back to haunt you. <br/><br/>And then after missions there is a lot of cool stuff regarding healing, buying new gear, and lifestyles that feeds into how glitches and money affects the game. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272473/#Comment_272473" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T09:25:51+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  9:25AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, very interesting.

Whaddaya think?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what you mean here.I remember playing an assassin in Cyberpunk 2020.  I put a lot of effort into customizing what he looked like.  He was modeled after Ogun from '80s Marvel.  The game was largely "go on missions", so I pretty much made all my decisions based on effectiveness, trying to be clever and succeed at the missions.  My character sheet also had all sorts of stuff about my background and why I was an assassin working these jobs with the other PCs, but I completely ignored that.  It was "Dave in a spooky costume" trying to beat security and ambush targets.  My character's gear list told me the tools at my disposal, and that was pretty much all I needed.<br/><br/>Some people might hear "ignoring background and motives" and think I wasn't immersed in my character.  But that was not my experience.  I was completely immersed, it's just that I was immersed in a character who wasn't defined by his life outside of missions.  He was defined largely by having my brain when it came to tactical problem-solving.<br/><br/>The one IC/OOC issue was voices.  As part of presenting their cool aesthetic (like my demon mask), some players adopted distinctive voices for their characters, which were kind of difficult to pull off, and would tend to get dropped when the group needed to discuss strategy.  Accordingly, discussions which could have been done IC went OOC.  This was unwelcome, so I now tell players not to do character voices that are overly difficult for them to maintain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272491/#Comment_272491" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T13:46:37+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  1:46PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>This sounds totally awesome!

This game is driven by description and player judgment. In many ways, it is not a "safe" game. What and how you say something matters a lot! There is also minimal flags or stuff the players define to communicate... "this is what I want out of the game." Which puts more work on the GM to read the players as we play and adjust as needed. But to counter balance this work, we're stripping as much from the GM as possible. There is very, very little mechanically the GM has to do, before, during, and after the game. So the GM does less and can listen and react more. <br/><br/>One thing we did in our playstorm is generate a list of random missions (I came up with a random generator) and give the players a few mission options. We did this in character, their fixer says... this is what I got... what job do you want? And the players choose. We then take a quick break and the GM asks out of character what excites the players about the mission the chose, notes that, and uses that as a starting point for fun! It's not that different than playing the first scene in Mouse Guard and then having players write their goals!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272502/#Comment_272502" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T15:31:02+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  3:31PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>As the players clarify the fiction and bid dice and money based on their assessments, the difficulty crystallizes.

But you lose your turn. The GM asks the next player what they are doing. And since time is of the essence, everyone gets to do 1 thing each before the GM reduced how much Money the mission is worth. So you may try something, find it too hard, not do it... but time is wasted which has a consequence. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Is there a way to speed through this process when a task is somewhat uncertain but the players don't care terribly much about it?

That said, conflicts even with player input are fast, so time has not been an issue. The thing that takes the longest, partially because it is a tense decision, is how players want to spend Hits. Do they cancel Glitches? Do they do more damage? Also as a GM, I want them to roll more because it gives me more chances to earn Glitches. So I need to describe stuff they want to roll to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272504/#Comment_272504" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T16:14:29+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  4:14PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2010 4:33PM by jenskot.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>What is "a turn"?</blockquote>\nThe GM describes problems and then asks each player what they want to do. Or the players can take the lead and tell the GM what they are doing and then the GM can introduce problems.<br/><br/>Players take turns asking questions, testing their abilities, helping other player's tests, or passing (waiting). After every player does something (takes a turn), then a round passes and 1 Money is removed from the mission's accumulating Money pool (represented by a stack of tokens, coins, chips). <br/><br/>This is awesome in play for a few reasons. It stops players from hogging spotlight. If a player wants to keep taking turns, then that means everyone else has to let them by passing, which means they are losing Money. It also reminds the GM to make sure everyone has a chance to do something. And the pressure to take action as the Money pool shrinks and grows is very strong... it feels thrilling... and emulates the fictional feel we want. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I don't quite understand your description of failure.

The scope of actions that you roll for?</blockquote>\nLet me use some Actual Play to help answer these questions.<br/><br/>We got into a fire fight and the Hacker wanted to run. There are 8 Abilities you roll that have specific effects and their own list of how you can spend Hits:<br/><br/>Fight\t\t<br/>Sneak\t\t<br/>Find\t\t<br/>Persuade\t<br/>Chase / Escape\t<br/>Break / Repair\t<br/>Hack\t\t<br/>Magic\t\t<br/><br/>It was the Hacker's turn, I told him 2 Trolls are shooting SMGs at him aiming to kill. The Hacker was like... "I run like hell, trying to evade their shots by losing them in the crowd of screaming people leaving the building." I was like, roll your "Chase / Escape" ability. 2 players thought he had a good chance of succeeding and gave him a die each, another player asked him to clarify if he was still carrying his huge heavy bag of equipment he stole, he was, and decided not to give him a die, and so on. Every player that doesn't give a die increases the mission Money by 1. He rolls, needs 4 Hits (based on the number of players) but only gets 2 and 1 Glitch. <br/><br/>If he just fails, he is dead. Or he could have the heavy bag of equipment he was carrying be destroyed by bullet fire to gain the Hits he needs. Or he could succeed but the GM gains 2 additional Glitches (since the player missed by 2 Hits) to spend plus the 1 Glitch from the roll itself. <br/><br/>The player decided he doesn't want to die and lets the GM have the 3 Glitches. The GM applies 2 Glitches as damage... you get away but are shot in the shoulder inches away from your head, and the last Glitch as a loose end... a camera catches crappy video footage (since it is only 1 Glitch) of the Hacker at the scene. But now the player succeeds and is out of the immediate danger of Trolls shooting at him.<br/><br/>If the player rolled extra Hits, they could have spent them to do any number of pre-defined things. Give another player a bonus die because the Trolls are so focused on shooting the escaping player it creates an opening for someone else. He could have escaped in way that covers his tracks so he would be harder to find later. He could have canceled any Glitches rolled. And much more! <br/><br/>Does that answer your question?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272506/#Comment_272506" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T16:25:01+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  4:25PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could have also increased the mission's Money and made escaping from the crime scene a threat with hit points (1 HP per Money).

Especially because the example involves the PC taking an explicit action. Lots of fun Glitches could occur and it would be an opportunity to add a few twists depending on how it plays out.<br/><br/>That said, what if a player asked, "is there a paper shredder in the office?" <br/><br/>I could say...<br/><br/>1. No. In many D&amp;D games at Conventions I've seen the DM automatically say no! If the player is asking, they must have some crazy idea on how to use it that would give them a major advantage. I would NOT do this! To me this is a gift. The player shows they care about something. Use it!<br/><br/>2. Yes and give them access to a paper shredder. The player is happy and you can keep the game moving forward.<br/><br/>3. Yes but... and throw an obstacle in-between them and the paper shredder. <br/><br/>4. No if it seems to break everyone else's suspension of disbelief. But I will follow up by asking why they are looking for a paper shredder and try to give them something else or point them in the direction that addresses their intent and speaks to their interest. But it also depends on the players. Some players want you to say no. Saying no for certain players makes the game feel real. And the brief moment of disappointment saying no creates is an opportunity to give them something cooler that still matches their intent. Oh... you wanted a kitchen knife... well there is an emergency axe! <br/><br/>5. Yes even if it breaks everyone else's suspension of disbelief... because it's an opportunity to add new details. Breaking expectations can suck if there is no reason but if there is a reason it can make an emotional impact... "there is a paper shredder and it looks like it was recently used with paper shreds scattered about and something stuck inside the shredder."<br/><br/>6. Roll! Maybe there is a paper shredder but you have to find it and any number of crazy things can happen along the way as the system introduces complications and unexpected results. <br/><br/>7.

So the GM does less and can listen and react more.</blockquote>This sounds like my ideal way to run a game.  Unfortunately, I've found that making my players do any number-manipulating takes them out of their In Character headspace.  I'd love to try your system and see if that's still an issue or not.<br/><br/>I think it depends on a person's specific tastes, expectations, experiences, and habits. <br/><br/>For some people in D&amp;D, having a level and class is automatically a deal breaker character immersion wise. Many of the Call of Cthulhu community flipped out when D20 Call of Cthulhu came out by Wizards (I thought it was pretty cool). People couldn't get past being a, I believe the joke was, a 4th level librarian! Yet for me, BRP CoC is so unreliable given the expectations it promises, I find it very difficult to immerse in my character. <br/><br/>Dread (Jenga) is an amazing game at unifying mechanics with the feel of the fiction. The Jenga tower literally emulates the dread of the fiction as it slowly thins out, and claws its way reaching towards oblivion. Fantastic! <br/><br/>For this specific group, I strive to make a lot of number crunching tied to the fiction. Their Abilities are mostly phrased as actions. When they want to find something, they roll Find. The larger the die pool, the more plentiful the dice in your hand, the better you are. It's tactile. Successes are easier to spot than adding die values. And deciding if you will spend Hits to cancel Glitches rings true to the fiction. Do I stay behind cover and wait till I can safely take my shot or do I go all out and take a risk? Damn... I failed... and the bullet is about to hit me... do I sacrifice my gear or do I just... after getting used to it (which is quick) a lot of the number crunching can help drive character immersion. <br/><br/>The only time it can get a little meta is when players obsess about the best way to spend Hits (beyond canceling Glitches). But they also mostly enjoy it in a gut wrenching kind of way. For the 1 player who doesn't, I make recommendations on how to spend his Hits and he's pretty happy not to worry about it. But I make sure never to offer to quickly in case in the rare cases he does have something in mind. In general he's there mostly to hang out with his old friends and treats board game and other games the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272703/#Comment_272703" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T21:17:00+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  9:17PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The larger the die pool, the more plentiful the dice in your hand, the better you are.

The flexibility to pick the right one for the moment is great, but I've found it's also useful to prime the players' expectations with some consistency.  Like, if I've been in a "whatever would be cool" groove, then when I do a "what's most likely", people can get caught off guard.<br/><br/>My own method is a few steps:<br/><br/><b>Step 1)</b> Ask myself if the shredder is definitely present (say "yes"), definitely not present (say "no"), or could go either way (move on to next step).<br/><b>Step 2)</b> Ask the players why they care.

"You're looking for a shredder now because...?"<br/><b>Step 3)</b> If necessary, ask the players what they expect.  If possible, do so without revealing that I haven't determined an answer yet.  "You're looking in the admin office?  How many companies do you think keep their shredders in the admin office?"<br/><b>Step 4)</b> Make a decision, based on many of the same principles you use.  I either meet their expectations, or break them in an interesting way that communicates a reason for the break.  If their plan for the shredder points toward fun play, given what I know of their goals and my adventure, I usually say "yes"; if not, I usually say "no".  After Steps 2-3, I can usually execute Step 4 instantly, as I've been weighing those factors (plausible? expected? fun?) since the initial inquiry was posed.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting you do this.  Confusion over GM rationale doesn't sound like an issue in this game, so hey, why not be flexible?

Sometimes they will negotiate terms for you, or sometimes you will do it yourself but they often handle transactions and making sure you get paid. <br/><br/>In general we establish that for each mission, time is of the essence and they don't want any loose ends. The quicker the job gets done, the more money you get and the more loose ends there are, the less money you get. So fictionally we establish that the money is somewhat variable and that the Fixer handles many of the specifics so the exact numbers are less important. <br/><br/>It took a little getting used to for the first mission but afterward was fairly seamless. The main issue is that some of the gear costs broke their suspension of disbelief. Game effect wise, it may make sense for a piece of gear like a knife to cost 1 money but it doesn't make sense to them relative to what else they can buy for 1 money. We need to tweak that or tweak the mechanical effects or the gear descriptions. <br/><br/>This is also an issue in Shadowrun itself. Many of the weapons you can but you would never bother with. They just don't make sense cost or effect wise relative to what else is available. That's a pretty easy problem to fix in general. Although it gets weird when it comes to things like vehicles.<br/><br/>Most Shadowrunners don't bother buying cars. For 80k, do you know how much gear you can buy? And although a car is very useful, its not always useful, which makes it harder to justify given the high cost. But there are characters that really want to buy very specific and fancy vehicles. But the normal Shadowrun costs are too high. But when we abstract it, it seems way too low when cost is determined by effect, flaws, and scarcity. It's a bit of a juggling game. And I haven't found a great answer yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272839/#Comment_272839" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T14:05:44+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  2:05PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>What if a player asked, "is there a paper shredder in the office?"<br/><br/>I could say...<br/><br/>1. No. In many D&amp;D games at Conventions I've seen the DM automatically say no! If the player is asking, they must have some crazy idea on how to use it that would give them a major advantage. I would NOT do this! To me this is a gift. The player shows they care about something. Use it!<br/><br/>2. Yes and give them access to a paper shredder. The player is happy and you can keep the game moving forward.<br/><br/>3. Yes but... and throw an obstacle in-between them and the paper shredder.<br/><br/>4. No if it seems to break everyone else's suspension of disbelief. But I will follow up by asking why they are looking for a paper shredder and try to give them something else or point them in the direction that addresses their intent and speaks to their interest. But it also depends on the players. Some players want you to say no. Saying no for certain players makes the game feel real. And the brief moment of disappointment saying no creates is an opportunity to give them something cooler that still matches their intent. Oh... you wanted a kitchen knife... well there is an emergency axe!<br/><br/>5. Yes even if it breaks everyone else's suspension of disbelief... because it's an opportunity to add new details. Breaking expectations can suck if there is no reason but if there is a reason it can make an emotional impact...

Maybe there is a paper shredder but you have to find it and any number of crazy things can happen along the way as the system introduces complications and unexpected results.<br/><br/>7.

Which for many of my other groups is totally cool. But for this group instantly kills their immersion. That's why if I say no, I will then ask them why they were asking, and then offer them an alternative that is less immersion breaking. But I won't ask before unless its unclear what they are asking for or if I can ask in a way that doesn't make things too meta.  <br/><br/>It's fun in its own way. I've been playing so many indie games I forgot what it was like to focus so much on not breaking immersion.

For 80k, do you know how much gear you can buy? And although a car is very useful, its not always useful, which makes it harder to justify given the high cost. But there are characters that really want to buy very specific and fancy vehicles. But the normal Shadowrun costs are too high. But when we abstract it, it seems way too low when cost is determined by effect, flaws, and scarcity. It's a bit of a juggling game. And I haven't found a great answer yet.</blockquote>\nFirst off, I've been enjoying this thread a lot even though I haven't had anything to say! I haven't played Shadowrun since, uh, 1st edition I think, when I thought the concept was cool but the rules were eh, so I never picked it up. But this thread inspired me to pick up the 4th ed rule book so that I could hack some kind of system to give it a try (or use Mouse Guard <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>)<br/><br/>Anyway, this concept of the money fluctuating with difficulty and time struck me as great for Shadowrun (and a neat concept to boot)! And I'm also a big fan of abstracted money. Nitty-gritty dollars and cents bore me in RPGs. I worry enough about that in real life. But, I think one thing that might help solve the disconnect in how money tokens play out in buying stuff would be to consider gear's usefulness in mission *only*. Maybe even come up with a system for determining a level of 'utility' linked to how much money actions grant you.<br/><br/>So, if a character wants a flashy car to hot rod around in, but it's not gonna do anything in a mission? No problem, he's got it, no tokens spent. But if he wants that really excellent knife to assassinate all the guards quietly, maybe that takes a token. This might be too meta for the player group you're talking about, but if you're willing to build in a level of abstraction to the money tokens (necessary bribes, living expenses, beer, et cetera) then it's a little easier to imagine flexibility in your non-mission critical gear (likewise 'cheaper' mission critical gear, like that knife, you can just assume the rest of the Nuyen was spent on ale and whores, err, beer and prostitutes)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272866/#Comment_272866" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T15:30:14+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  3:30PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, thanks for posting! <br/><br/>I'm glad you're enjoying the thread. I've gotten a lot of great ideas and feedback here that I've been able to immediately implement and see how it changes our actual play. <br/><br/>I like your idea of separating stuff that is purely color and stuff that has mechanical weight. [url=<a href="http://burningempires.com/]Burning" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://burningempires.com/]Burning</a> Empires [/url] I believe works this way, at least when I helped playtest it. And it worked really well. <br/><br/>The main tricky thing here is that pure color can have huge mechanical weight. Even if say your car doesn't give you a +1 Hit, if you are trying to escape and you describe using your non-mechanical sports car to do so, it will likely lead to the other players lowering the difficulty of escaping. But we could make it so that color gear just can't be used in missions. <br/><br/>There is still the issue of how to price a car that someone does want to use in a mission. Effectiveness wise, it would cost much less than it would in real life. Granted Money here is abstract but the players in our games compared the relative abstract costs and thought it felt wrong. That said they agreed it was a problem they were creating for themselves. They don't want a car to cost more, because it will be too expensive and they probably won't buy it, but they also feel its too cheap as is and breaks their sense of disbelief. <br/><br/>They even said an easy answer would be for them to just get over it :-) <br/><br/>But I'm wondering if I'm missing an alternative solution. <br/><br/>It's pretty much only an issue in extreme cases, super cheap gear like knives and super expensive gear like cars. That said, I spoke with one of the players earlier and they suggested that a knife can simply be included in a survival kit. You don't pay for the knife itself which eliminates the issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272924/#Comment_272924" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T22:19:24+00:00" title="May 24, 2010 10:19PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2010 11:41AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea that you can roll for something small but then wind up resolving tons of other stuff is unfamiliar to me in immersion-focused play.  I'm really curious about what the experience of that process is like.  I get that the dice and the mechanical decisions are <i>compatible</i> with the fiction.  I'm just surprised that you've managed to avoid the play experience wherein everyone sees the dice and mechanics <i>creating</i> fictional facts, and all of a sudden we're "playing a game", rather than "really being there".<br/><br/>Does anyone speak in abstract quantities?  Or do y'all avoid saying "Hit" and "Glitch" and instead wait to speak until you've formulated your decisions in terms of fictional specifics?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The quicker the job gets done, the more money you get and the more loose ends there are, the less money you get.</blockquote>Have you ever played Contract Work?  It's very similar to what you describe.  Except your employer docks your sloppiness via "one step closer to termination" rather than via money.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>But for this specific group of players, if I ask why they care about something existing before I tell them if it exists or not, its pretty clear that their answer effects my answer. Which for many of my other groups is totally cool. But for this group instantly kills their immersion. That's why if I say no, I will then ask them why they were asking, and then offer them an alternative that is less immersion breaking.</blockquote>Nice.  I've done that in the past too.  I don't need to anymore, but I think that's just because I've brainwashed my players into believing that (a) the fictional world really exists, but (b) I am a fallible reporter of it, and (c) sometimes it takes me a few seconds and some feedback to focus my goggles on it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>It's fun in its own way. I've been playing so many indie games I forgot what it was like to focus so much on not breaking immersion. I think there are healthy ways to do it without having long boring games with poor communication. I just think we need a system to facilitate communication that is tied to the fiction.</blockquote>It's a weird design experience, right?  It's like you want your procedures to talk to the players, but first you gotta go through the characters!  And, of course, you can only reach the characters via the fiction, and you can only do that if you keep the fiction plausible.  <br/><br/>In this position, my favorite tools are a pre-char-gen agreement on "what we are here to do (in the fiction)" and a setting that provides opportunities and obstacles for that.  I guess that's why you're still saying "We're playing Shadowrun!" despite all your changes, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273025/#Comment_273025" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T14:59:54+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  2:59PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is definitely very cool. The tradeoff of Money vs. task difficulty is really interesting, and perfect. Have you had any trouble getting it to "feel" balanced, in terms of 1 Money being worth a die on a roll?<br/><br/>Do people try to do stuff they would likely fail just to bump up the Money for the mission?<br/><br/>But there are many other cool elements about this system, as well. For instance, at some point it could happen that you roll and fail. When that happens, it sounds like you can agree to fail or decide to succeed, but at the cost of giving the GM Glitches. So, I can envision a cool situation where a runner must decide whether to die OR survive but with a high number of Glitches--and the player decides to have the character go down, giving up his life to keep his friends from screwing up the mission.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, what's the lethality like? Because, depending on how Glitches turn into wounds, it could be very safe or very dangerous.<br/><br/>Also, how strict are the rules for applying Glitches? Do you make stuff up that sounds about right, or are you limited to very specific options?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273026/#Comment_273026" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T15:02:01+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  3:02PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, when you have the time, I'd *really* like to hear what reflexes/habits/techniques from "story gaming" are harmful in a more "immersive" context.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Also, when you have the time, I'd *really* like to hear what reflexes/habits/techniques from "story gaming" are harmful in a more "immersive" context. </blockquote>\nImmersion is personal to each individual (I believe), which is why discussing it can be treacherous. That said, I can speak (to some extent) for some of my friends who love immersion. <br/><br/>Many people find Dogs breaks their immersion but not my friends. They felt Dogs forced them to immerse more!<br/><br/>But Call of Cthulhu breaks their immersion (when the basic system is adhered to and modules are run as is). They feel nothing they say or do affects what happens when they roll. Further, their character's level of skill described fictionally doesn't match what actually happens in play. You 1. describe a bunch of stuff and 2. roll but the two aren\u2019t connected.<br/><br/>Games like PTA break their immersion because the resolution system resolves too much for them. That said, they like PTA from the perspective of co-authoring something cool as if they were a group of writers breaking a script. I suspect that would make Matt happy! <br/><br/>Pretty much anytime fictional actions and consequences (fictional or mechanical) are disconnected, their immersion is disrupted. Also, even if they are connected, but they can\u2019t follow it naturally in the fiction (scene resolution resolving too much too quick), they have issues. <br/><br/>Timing is important. They don\u2019t like rolling for social conflicts in D&amp;D 3E because you roll once, and the conversation is resolved in a few minutes of real time. It happens so fast, it\u2019s not clear why you or anyone were convinced of anything. But they love Dogs social conflicts. It\u2019s almost real time! And you decide if you are convinced most of the times by giving or refusing to escalate (the fact that conflicts aren\u2019t just talking or fighting but can go back and forth is also a big bonus in Dogs for them). D&amp;D combat also breaks their immersion, you can lose 75% of your hit points and its no different than losing 1% moment to moment. Also combat may only take 10 minutes in the fiction but 1 hour in real time, that also takes everyone out of the game. \n<blockquote><cite> What are the hardest parts of running this game for you?</cite></blockquote>\nThat\u2019s a huge question. I don\u2019t think I can cover too much of it now but I will tie this in with the above. What 1 person finds immersive may break someone else\u2019s immersion. That\u2019s a tough spot for the GM.<br/><br/>But there is a big ugly problem with immersion. Sometimes what breaks immersion isn\u2019t the game but the player\u2019s own selfishness. <br/><br/>We\u2019ve discussed this as a group and people freely admit it. Sometimes you just imagine a very specific amazing moment for your character, and it may not be realistic, it may not be entertaining to anyone else, it may not be consistent with your own typical preferences, and it may not fit with what\u2019s currently happening\u2026 but you imagine your character successfully doing this cool thing\u2026 before its your turn or even before you rolled the dice\u2026 and when things don\u2019t match your premature expectations, its easy to have your immersion broken and be disappointed. But it\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault. You did it to yourself. It\u2019s essentially the evils of preplay. <br/><br/>Usually when this happens people fess up to it and it\u2019s a non issue. But sometimes people start rationalizing the behavior and it can become dysfunctional. When someone starts complaining about immersion, I do my best to understand exactly what the problem is. And sometimes it\u2019s not something any of us can fix, but something the player has to fix themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273046/#Comment_273046" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T18:19:15+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  6:19PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2010 6:38PM by jenskot.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>The idea that you can roll for something small but then wind up resolving tons of other stuff is unfamiliar to me in immersion-focused play.  I'm really curious about what the experience of that process is like.  I get that the dice and the mechanical decisions are<i>compatible</i>with the fiction.  I'm just surprised that you've managed to avoid the play experience wherein everyone sees the dice and mechanics<i>creating</i>fictional facts, and all of a sudden we're "playing a game", rather than "really being there".</blockquote>\nYou don\u2019t roll and then just color the roll. You\u2019re coloring determines what you roll and how difficult it is in very tangible ways, then you roll which creates new opportunities for you and the GM that aren\u2019t just interpreting the roll with color but also re-engaging the system and the world. The mechanics don\u2019t create and determine fictional facts. The dice create opportunities for you to decide what fictional facts you want included which are backed up with mechanical consequences.<br/><br/>I want to shoot something. Roll\u2026 shit (Glitches), it\u2019s dangerous! I can play it safe and squeeze out a shot doing a little damage or I can take a risk and go all out regardless of the consequences. Then\u2026 damn\u2026 the consequences are huge\u2026 the trolls are running at me with monofilament whips, I don\u2019t have time to dodge but I can take the hit or sacrifice my new cyberarm! \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Does anyone speak in abstract quantities?  Or do y'all avoid saying "Hit" and "Glitch" and instead wait to speak until you've formulated your decisions in terms of fictional specifics? </blockquote>\nSlowly we\u2019re moving away from declaring Hits. Players can just use them for whatever they want without making too many meta declarations. We\u2019re still working out Glitches. We\u2019re thinking the player can simply push forward any 1s they rolled (that they didn\u2019t cancel) and the GM can describe what they mean fictionally without declaring, \u201cI\u2019m spending 2 Glitches\u201d. <br/><br/>I have indeed played Contract Work! Great game! I think if I were to play Mafia hitmen in Shadowrun, I would use Contract Work. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>In this position, my favorite tools are a pre-char-gen agreement on "what we are here to do (in the fiction)" and a setting that provides opportunities and obstacles for that.  I guess that's why you're still saying "We're playing Shadowrun!" despite all your changes, right?</blockquote>\nNames matter! I\u2019ve found just by calling it Shadowrun, the players care more!

The tradeoff of Money vs. task difficulty is really interesting, and perfect. Have you had any trouble getting it to "feel" balanced, in terms of 1 Money being worth a die on a roll? <br/>Do people try to do stuff they would likely fail just to bump up the Money for the mission? </blockquote>\nWe haven\u2019t played enough yet for me to have a strong sense of this but my instincts say people will definitely not be too shy about going all out! The system rewards players who want to try crazy things just as much as the players who want to play it safe. And the group definitely has both types of players! <br/><br/>The only balancing issues we have had with Money is the cost of gear relative to other gear. See the Money examples of Cars and Knives in previous posts.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But there are many other cool elements about this system, as well. For instance, at some point it could happen that you roll and fail. When that happens, it sounds like you can agree to fail or decide to succeed, but at the cost of giving the GM Glitches. So, I can envision a cool situation where a runner must decide whether to die OR survive but with a high number of Glitches--and the player decides to have the character go down, giving up his life to keep his friends from screwing up the mission. </blockquote>\nYes!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Speaking of which, what's the lethality like? Because, depending on how Glitches turn into wounds, it could be very safe or very dangerous. </blockquote>\nIt\u2019s very lethal. Plus you can die just by failing a roll if that is what is at stake. But in almost all cases, you have a lot of control over failing and succeeding. It comes down to what you want to sacrifice.<br/><br/>We\u2019ve also replaced the Shadowrun death spiral with a consequence spiral. The more major wounds you take, the more glitches you roll. You don\u2019t lose effectiveness but you do make the GM more effective!!!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Also, how strict are the rules for applying Glitches? Do you make stuff up that sounds about right, or are you limited to very specific options?</blockquote>\nGM has a list of what they can spend Glitches on. We may further restrict it based on what Ability is being rolled. Can you inflict damage with Glitches on a Persuade roll? Some of the group says yes! Some are iffy. Not sure yet. Everyone is comfortable with Glitches being unpredictable to some extent given that you can usually choose to cancel them out. It makes every roll feel tense. Which works for Shadowrun. It\u2019s like playing Dread (Jenga) where any pull could lead to bloody carnage!

For many of my friends, requiring them to ask this is too meta and breaks their immersion. And it can feel like asking for permission, the subtext is \u201cI want there to be a glass on the bar, GM can there be a glass on the bar?\u201d<br/><br/>Stating \u201cI look for a glass on the bar\u201d is still in the fiction. It\u2019s describing a character\u2019s direct action while making the player\u2019s intent transparent (there not just saying I look at the bar but looking for something specific). Generally this is immersion friendly. It still carries risk and a level of assumption. You probably wouldn\u2019t have asked if you didn\u2019t expect something to be on the bar and hoping it would be a glass. The player is looking to engage with you and the fiction, if they find nothing, it\u2019s a chance to provide an alternative so they don\u2019t disengage. <br/><br/>Assuming \u201cI grab a glass from the bar\u201d is highly immersive, they don\u2019t have to ask, they are there in the moment\u2026 it\u2019s real time, it\u2019s thrilling, and holy shit\u2026 this is happening right now! But as much as it is super immersive, it risks collapsing immersion if there is indeed no glass on the bar. <br/><br/>As a GM (for me), \u201cI grab a glass from the bar\u201d is a gift. If someone is that immersed, and we want to play an immersive game, I want to keep them in that moment. Even if there is no glass, now there is. It\u2019s also much less work for me. I don\u2019t have to describe every last detail of setting minutia. The player did it for me! <br/><br/>I can see problems if the player goes into too much detail\u2026 \u201cI grab a lip stick stained corona bottle with fingerprints of my dad\u2019s ex-boss.\u201d It\u2019s easy and safe for everyone to assume there is a glass on a bar, it\u2019s mundane, common, but beyond that it risks conflicting with what everyone is imagining and every additional detail comes with subtext of further assumptions that risk more and more miscommunication. It\u2019s definitely a balancing act. My players don\u2019t want the world to be black till the GM provides light. But because it is a group activity, even if illuminated, the details need to be blurry and only come into greater focus with direct interaction in the fiction. <br/><br/>\u201cI grab a glass from the bar\u201d is a double edge sword. It can be incredibly immersive or completely throw you out of the game. For me, the benefit outweighs the risk. And the risk can be mitigated! It\u2019s an opportunity! If the GM thinks it is so important that there is no glass\u2026 then say why\u2026 make it clear! Introduce a twist! Break the expectation by further revealing deeper truths about the fiction that the players can immerse in. If there is no deeper meaning, if the glass doesn\u2019t matter to the GM, then why forbid it? What\u2019s really going on here? It\u2019s one thing if every detail about the bar was predetermined and written down beforehand\u2026 that\u2019s cool, it makes the game a huge puzzle for the players to explore, but if not, if the GM is just making it up, and there is no deeper meaning or opportunity for a twist, then why say no? For some, it\u2019s because they view their interpretation of the fiction to be more important that everyone else\u2019s. For others, it\u2019s a matter of training\u2026 so people don\u2019t form habits of making assumptions. But is that habit bad? <br/><br/>What if it isn\u2019t \u201cI grab a glass from the bar?\u201d What if it is, \u201cI chop the big bad\u2019s head off?\u201d <br/><br/>In combat, people usually describe actions\u2026 I \u201cpunch\u201d, \u201cshoot\u201d, \u201crun\u201d, \u201cnegotiate\u201d, not effects\u2026 I \u201cknock his teeth out\u201d, \u201cshoot him dead\u201d, \u201crun away and no one can find me\u201d, \u201cconvince him to surrender\u201d. <br/><br/>Isn\u2019t making setting assumptions describing actions and effects? Why is that ok then, as long as someone is super immersed, and doing the same in combat not ok? Maybe it is. Maybe it depends on the stakes. Maybe it depends if we are just talking back and forth vs. using dice to determine effects.<br/><br/>The danger I see is when someone preplays in their mind what will happen and won\u2019t accept anyone else\u2019s input\u2026 the dice or the players. This is true for the GM as well. Preplay is often responsible for railroading. And selfishness responsible for preplay. <br/><br/>If we agree that the dice matter, then why did we roll if we don\u2019t accept either outcome of the roll? <br/><br/>It\u2019s tricky. I don\u2019t know if there is a right answer. Immersion can be very selfish because it isn\u2019t completely shared. It\u2019s in your head. But that\u2019s not a bad thing (neither is selfishness if it doesn\u2019t hurt other people). Where you draw the line is personal.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve largely sidestepped this by building the resolution mechanics so that failure is in the hands of the players. What you are rolling for is the consequences of your actions and the degree they affect the world. The only time you really fail is if you choose to by not accepting the rolled consequences. In actual play it seems to make all the difference. It also seems to be why the players are ok with talking conflicts in Dogs in the Vineyard and not a single diplomacy roll in D&amp;D 3E. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273100/#Comment_273100" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T07:27:54+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  7:27AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Great answers, John.

But that may break the level of immersion they enjoy. I like the way The Shadow of Yesterday handles it, when you lose, you can bring down the pain.

Because I would think the question of pacing a conflict could easily be handled via the effects of action/intent and how those Hits are spent. Like, a player rolling to escape in a car spending Hits to establish "We lose them in Chinatown before it gets dark" is very different from "I get a lead on them going around the first corner" and "They can't get a clear shot at me". Still not easy though.<br/><br/>And great "immersion" discussion (with all attendant caveats)! I agree with pretty much everything said so far, although I'm still not sold on the "asking permission" thing--I see it more the way John is describing it. What do you think, Dave?<br/><br/>ETA: The thing with the "asking permission" thing is that it's heavily GM-dependent, I guess. Like, I have no qualms playing "asking for permission" with either of you in the GM chair, for instance, because I know (or at least expect! and demand!) that you'll bring the fun. But it strikes me as a shaky platform for a solid roleplay experience--for a group to rely on that to succeed all the time sounds like a shot in the dark sometimes. If I were GMing, I'd end up doing a lot of the mental acrobatics you both describe, which sometimes feels like spinning in place for no good value. Is it really more immersive to have a long conversation about whether the glass is on the bar? Maybe it's easier to keep the flow by just going along with it--just grab the glass!

For many of my friends, requiring them to ask this is too meta and breaks their immersion.

It\u2019s describing a character\u2019s direct action while making the player\u2019s intent transparent (there not just saying I look at the bar but looking for something specific).

Players may be anywhere along the spectrum from, "In character, I'm probing my surroundings, looking for something I can use, such as a glass" to, "I want a glass, can I have one?" to, "My mental image of this bar already includes a glass, but I'm doing the group the courtesy of confirming outloud."<br/><br/>My preferred practice is to operate as if the best-case mindset is in place ("In-character probing") and respond accordingly, regardless of specific phrasing.  If someone says, "Is there a glass?" I'll respond, "As you look for one, you see that..."  <br/><br/>I'm doing my best to keep the character-fiction interaction moving, and I'll trust everyone else at the table to do the same to the best of their ability.  Like, y'know, if I say, "Corporations refrigerate their data storage rooms because it's a brownout buffer," then hopefully a player will bring that back to the moment and say, "My character puts on his warm gloves before opening the storage room door."<br/><br/>I have found, though, that this dynamic doesn't just happen, and that advocating "I look for..." and the attendant mindset before play can help.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Assuming \u201cI grab a glass from the bar\u201d is highly immersive, they don\u2019t have to ask, they are there in the moment\u2026 it\u2019s real time, it\u2019s thrilling, and holy shit\u2026 this is happening right now!

Introduce a twist!</blockquote>When I discuss "immersion" in Delve, I clarify "immersion in character POV".  If this is not what your Shadowrun group is into, then we'll have different approaches.  It sounds to me like you are describing "unbroken attention <i>to</i> the fiction" rather than necessarily "thinking from <i>within</i> the fiction".<br/><br/>From character POV, the interaction where a player says "I grab the glass!" and the GM says "There's no glass, but there's a cool reason for that!" is unworkable.  In character, you just observed an event of your buddy grabbing a glass, and then were told that you just hallucinated, and have been transported back in time to before your hallucination.  If your players can stay immersed in character through <i>that</i>, they can do it through <i>anything</i>.<br/><br/>I can certainly see how they'd stay strongly engaged with the fiction, though.<br/><br/>For me, the player and GM roles say a lot about the type of immersion the group is going for.  In Delve, the social contract is that there's a hard separation in authorities -- players have 100% of the character control, GM has 100% of the setting control.  This suits "character POV" immersion.  I can't control my environment in the real world, and I want that same orientation as my character in the game world, of curiosity and vulnerability.<br/><br/>This is also my answer to Paul's "asking permission" question.  The platform is the opposite of shaky.  It's the best possible platform for "all you can control is yourself" play.  This meshes most obviously with exploration and mystery games, but also adds its unique spice to any other activities if you can pull it off.  A touch of ignorance and powerlessness can add extra adrenaline in dangerous missions!<br/><br/>John, if you're finding that it's not necessary for the GM to be the sole creator of setting in this Shadowrun game, I wonder how much setting authority you could give the players?  Perhaps your only job could be to provide challenge, and the players can make up whatever they want as long as that doesn't dilute your challenges?<br/><br/>Or maybe our play styles are closer together than that.  After all, immersion can only be sustained if intense engagement is too.  Accordingly, any character-POV-supporting procedures which bored your players and caused them to disengage would be a net loss on the immersion front.  So maybe you're just maximizing the engagement portion of immersion, and finding that the character-POV portion is less vital for this group.  Actually, you may have already said exactly that in this thread, but I don't want to assume!<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-Dave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273134/#Comment_273134" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T09:53:46+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  9:53AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Do you think that it would be possible for this group to go GM-less, and let anyone provide adversity?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273142/#Comment_273142" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T10:50:09+00:00" title="May 26, 2010 10:50AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Let me play Devil's Advocate for a minute! <br/><br/>Why is it that:<br/><br/>1.

The player takes her mental picture of the bar, and acts by saying, "I grab the glass!" The GM says, "Ok!" -&gt; not time travel and hallucination?<br/><br/>After all, based on the way you've designed Delve, it's clearly the players who are intended to immerse, not also the GM. In case 1, the players have to change their perception of the fictional reality to match what the GM is now saying, creating this disconnect between what they were imagining and what's "actually there" in their minds. In case 2, the GM has to change his perception of the fiction, creating this same disconnect in his mind--but he could do so complete secretly, without ever revealing it to the players.<br/><br/>Is it just because it's a slippery slope, and you're worried the players will narrate things that will "screw up" the mission you've got planned? That seems odd when Delve (as far as I can tell) presupposes the Delvers' success most of the time--or, at the very least, doesn't collapse due to a lack of challenge.<br/><br/>Put another way, the game presupposes that the players trust the GM not to rig things against them, and be "fair" and honest in presenting the fictional world. Why doesn't the trust flow the other way to the players: don't state any action unless you think all the elements for it to take place are already existing in the fiction?<br/><br/>(And this is kind of getting away from John's topic, I just realize.

Most of them enjoyed them. Except strangely enough (maybe not strangely) one person who is an actor in real life and another person who is a director! You figure the director would be ok with it, but things are now that simple. Heh :-)<br/><br/>This group seem to enjoy adding very basic details to the fiction (my character knows X person, I would probably be carrying Y, or this is a hospital and there should be Z exits in the basement). They even subtly enjoy adding elements of adversity. But all from their character's perspective. <br/><br/>What they don't seem to enjoy (not all but most) is playing multiple characters or NPCs. Which is funny because some of them have GMed. But when they play, they just want to focus on their character. Especially in Shadowrun. Immersion doesn't seem to matter to them in all games but in Shadowrun, for different reasons, some I don't understand, they really want to be immersed. <br/><br/>That said, if they are up to it I'd play more GMless games with them. I like to challenge my own assumptions to see if they still hold true and the best way to do that is to play more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273153/#Comment_273153" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T11:35:49+00:00" title="May 26, 2010 11:35AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite> From character POV, the interaction where a player says "I grab the glass!" and the GM says "There's no glass, but there's a cool reason for that!" is unworkable.

In Delve, the social contract is that there's a hard separation in authorities -- players have 100% of the character control, GM has 100% of the setting control.  This suits "character POV" immersion.  I can't control my environment in the real world, and I want that same orientation as my character in the game world, of curiosity and vulnerability. </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite> After all, immersion can only be sustained if intense engagement is too.  Accordingly, any character-POV-supporting procedures which bored your players and caused them to disengage would be a net loss on the immersion front.  So maybe you're just maximizing the engagement portion of immersion, and finding that the character-POV portion is less vital for this group.  Actually, you may have already said exactly that in this thread, but I don't want to assume!</blockquote>\nFor these specific players, what makes them feel immersed is constant engagement, not having their suspension of disbelief completely broken, not getting too meta, having the mechanics and fiction closely linked, and actions having consequences. <br/><br/>Character POV matters to them (they don\u2019t want to play NPCs or narrate their own adversity) but they can leave that perspective as needed and then re-immerse without too many problems. Every time they aren\u2019t in a scene but can watch what is happening as an audience member, they are no longer immersed in their character\u2019s POV. Same thing whenever they look down at their character sheet, roll dice, their husband calls them on the phone, they have to go to the bathroom, they eat snacks, they hear honking outside, they see that their friend isn\u2019t actually a troll, and on and on. Breaking character POV and then reengaging is a non issue as long as the fiction while they are in their character\u2019s POV doesn\u2019t break their suspension of disbelief most of the time. And when it does, its quickly fixed or compensated for so they can quickly re-immerse. Although so far I haven\u2019t had to break their suspension of disbelief so I don\u2019t know what that looks like in actual play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273190/#Comment_273190" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T13:44:03+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  1:44PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2010 1:55PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, thanks for parsing all that text I threw at ya.  Your players' ability to jump in and out of character POV as needed reminds me a bit of how we played Land of Nodd and Polaris, basically taking turns doing character POV and other turns doing other roles.<br/><br/>This is very different than my own experience of immersion in character POV, which is largely a sort of "flow" state.  It takes a while to get into the groove, but when you do, you ride it.  In my Delve campaign, hours of real time slip by without a single moment of player speech that isn't either (a) in character, or (b) announcing action.<br/><br/>It makes sense that some of the techniques and habits I've developed to support "two hours of no meta" are not worth it to you.  Accordingly, I'm not sure whether my response to Paul applies to your game or not:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Why is it that:<br/>1. The player says, "I grab the glass!" The GM takes his mental picture of the bar and says, "Uh, there's no glass there." -&gt; Time travel and hallucination!</blockquote>As GM, I would never say "You erred, there's no glass" <i>just</i> to enforce my vision of the fiction over the players'.  Rather, I'd do it to help them get into the groove.  "Remember, you're looking out at the gameworld, not defining it."  And to train good habits that I know will keep them in the groove.  <br/><br/>Once you are in the groove, and someone says, "I grab a glass," then that happened.  You saw it in your mind's eye.  So, maybe the GM doesn't notice, or maybe he judges that now's a bad time to train habits, and rolls with it.  <br/><br/>But if the GM, or any other player, knows that glass is a luxury for the wealthy and this bar simply cannot afford it, they have to stand up for plausibility.  Riding on that plausibility is not only the future immersion of all players (when in-game economic realities come up), but also the present immersion of any players who may have the right idea already.  The player who says, "Not plausible.  This place couldn't afford glass," is just doing his part for the long-term good of the group.  The GM should do the same.<br/><br/>Paul, once you get used to it, it's neither difficult nor cumbersome to say, "I look for a glass."  Nothing is sacrificed.<br/><br/>John, here's a concern that might be more relevant to your Shadowrun game.  In some of my past play, players would develop tactical ideas and then make claims about the fiction to advocate said tactics.  "I assume we can find some bolt cutters, so I use them" wasn't actually an impartial assumption about the setting, it was a hope phrased in an obnoxious way.  "I want bolt cutters, so I'm going to make it socially awkward for the GM to tell me I can't just have them and beat his challenge."  You could take this behavior as a sign of a douchebag you shouldn't play with.  Or, it could be a totally cool player who's just picked up a bad habit and needs to be trained out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273192/#Comment_273192" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T13:48:24+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  1:48PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>We need better communication tools for extended conflicts.<br/><br/>Right now the players and GM collectively determine how hard an action is. But the GM alone determines how many \u201cHit Points\u201d a threat has by either spending Glitches or making the mission worth more Money.<br/><br/>But one time we played I misread a player. They wanted to escape in a car from a threat and we resolved it in 1 roll. But it was clear afterward when we did a roundtable debriefing that they would have preferred that it was an extended conflict.<br/><br/>I could simply ask when they want something to be an extended conflict. But that may break the level of immersion they enjoy. I like the way The Shadow of Yesterday handles it, when you lose, you can bring down the pain. But this was a situation where they wanted an extended conflict even though they won. Which makes it more ambiguous as it isn\u2019t tied to failure.</blockquote>\nWhen a player states his/her intent, how clearly is it communicated? Because I would think the question of pacing a conflict could easily be handled via the effects of action/intent and how those Hits are spent. Like, a player rolling to escape in a car spending Hits to establish "We lose them in Chinatown before it gets dark" is very different from "I get a lead on them going around the first corner" and "They can't get a clear shot at me". Still not easy though.<br/> <br/>Actions are normally fluid, you can try to flat out escape (which would likely be hard) or try to get a lead by going around a corner or making it hard for them to get a clear shot at you (which is giving yourself bonus dice to a future roll and fictional leverage when determining the difficulty of a roll). <br/><br/>But to extend the drama, a GM can give a conflict Hit Points. Which in some cases still means you can overcome a threat in one roll if you have enough Hits, in other cases it could mean more back and forth. <br/><br/>This is usually a non-issue but it\u2019s up to the GM to try to read the players and determine what should be an extended dramatic conflict (which is easier in this game since there isn\u2019t that much for the GM to do so they can listen more). But sometimes the GM will misread the players. The problem is, how do you have the players communicate something so meta (when they want an extended conflicts) when they also want to minimize meta rules? Is there something they could indicate from within the fiction that can clue the GM into when they want or don\u2019t want an extended conflict? Is there a way for the players to indicate something is important to them using their character\u2019s actions?<br/><br/>This could be an impossible task but I\u2019m very open to suggestions. At worst, this may just be something that breaks the players immersion but it\u2019s worth it. But I want to explore my options first. <br/><br/>The other way to look at it is, if they want a conflict to be extended, they are already thinking in a very meta way, so why not just drop the pretense that the interest is from a character\u2019s POV and clearly communicate the player\u2019s actual interest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273220/#Comment_273220" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T16:28:18+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  4:28PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, during the phase of resolution when the players are agreeing on how difficult something is, could they also agree on how complex it is?<br/><br/>If they say, "Yeah, that sounds complex, it'll take a lot of different actions to get there," then that's the GM's cue to give it more HP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273305/#Comment_273305" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T10:00:00+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 10:00AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I was wondering about that, too.

The idea that it's those habits that help a person "get into the groove", and then aren't necessarily as important afterwards is interesting!<br/><br/>From my perspective, I'm looking at various techniques and habits from my formative gaming years, and trying to figure out which tools fit which situations. For instance, reframing a player's intent as an action that leads to different results ("I grab a glass" -&gt; "As you turn to look for a glass, you realize...") is something I've often done without even thinking about it, even though John seems surprised by it! However, John's type of "immersion", as he describes it in this game (and as happens in a game like Land of Nodd), is much more familiar to me than any kind of persistent "flow" state as you describe it!<br/><br/>I think I see "immersion" more as something a player does, or creates for themselves, than something a GM or group imposes upon/creates for the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273311/#Comment_273311" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T10:24:44+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 10:24AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2010 10:33AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in practice I think it goes more like, "those habits are <i>most</i> important for finding the groove, but are <i>also</i> handy for maintaining it, and once you wind up with one you tend to wind up with both".<br/><br/>As for group/individual, I agree that you've gotta bring your own intent to immerse, but I think it helps immensely to know how you might realize that in this environment, with this group, while allowing (and maybe even helping) your fellow players to do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273380/#Comment_273380" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T16:49:47+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  4:49PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>If you narrated an aside or whatever it might be called where you describe a story element for which none of the PCs are present (big boss motions to send his goons out to look for someone), are they okay with that?

And 1 was almost a\u2026 disaster! But revealing!<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup 1 wasn\u2019t my old friends, they were people who mostly didn\u2019t know each other. A LARPer, 2 boardgames with some RPG experience, and someone who has never played an RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a few balancing and clarity issues but the game ran smoothly. The LARPer who said she doesn\u2019t like game mechanics had no problem with assigning and coloring Hits and Glitches, and for the most part the players setting the difficulty went smoothly. The boardgamers were all over it but definitely occasionally gamed it. The players with no RPG experience sometimes was shy about judging situation but eventually grew into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately this is a game I\u2019m hacking together for my old friends and probably wouldn\u2019t have been my first choice to run with other people but the opportunity presented itself so I jumped on it. And overall it worked well!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I ran it for some of my old friends!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so good!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe \u201cplayers set the difficulty\u201d turned into a communication tool that helped clarify that everyone wants really, really different things from gaming. Mechanically it helped inspire clarity in people\u2019s preferences but the game didn\u2019t work well.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 person wanted everything to be super realistic (although one time tried something he admitted wasn\u2019t realistic to get a mechanical advantage and felt dirty about it afterward). He couldn\u2019t accept that money was abstracted and said he wanted to track every dollar and cent his character owns. But he was ok with players setting difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother person didn\u2019t care about reality at all and wanted to flip through the air using nunchucks against people with automatic weapons. He mostly loved the game although really didn\u2019t like it when people thought what he was doing in the fiction was ridiculous and set his difficulty high.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother person refused to let the GM have any Glitches! He would rather fail every single test than let the GM add a twist. When we played Mouse Guard it was similar, he asked a few times if the GM could let him fail instead of applying a condition or a twist in exchange for a success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last person couldn\u2019t deal with anything meta. The idea you could judge a situation as a player was too much and refused to engage (same thing happened when we played PTA with fan mail). Even though he helped come up with the idea of the meta players set the difficulty mechanic, when he was immersed in character he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. But if his character wasn\u2019t in the scene, he was ok with using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was tough. Really tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all wanted to feel immersed but that meant really different things to different people. The person flipping through the air felt immersed like he was reliving scenes from the Matrix. But that was breaking the immersion of the other players. Most of the players were ok with a little meta mechanics but 1 person couldn\u2019t accept anything Meta at all, to the point where he said he would be ok if he didn\u2019t even have a character sheet (although he loves several hour long character creation sessions).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther observations about the system:<br/>\n<br/>\n- They liked the players set the difficulty mechanics in talking scenes and were brutal about setting difficulties high when they weren\u2019t convinced by what was said.<br/>\n<br/>\n- But they didn\u2019t want to use it in combat! Regardless of the situation, many of them abandoned the mechanics and just tried to make it easier for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n- They didn\u2019t like that the mechanics encouraged them to pay attention to everyone else\u2019s scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many of them were playing to beat the GM. They said because of there 18+ years of playing D&amp;D;, they don\u2019t like having character relationships that can be used against them or giving the GM any extra ability to have any advantage over them. In some cases they would rather not get what they wanted if that meant the GM also didn\u2019t get anything. Which kind of makes the whole Glitch mechanic (which was so amazing in Group 1) worthless for this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, the fiction of the game was really amazing! They kept doing crazy things that were hilarious and fully bought in to most of the situations I described (its only when dice were involved that things sometimes would get weird).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd again, they out thought the overall situation. They were supposed to baby-sit a Yakuza\u2019s grounded teenage daughter and her cybered up endangered leopard in their garden block long deck loft apartment across from central park. PETA was protesting the family because of the daughter\u2019s pet leopard and a rival Yakuza family used the protests to help them kidnap the daughter (while PETA tried to kidnap the leopard). As you can probably imagine, it was hilarious. They were paid to protect the daughter, pet, and apartment for 3 weeks. 3/4ths into the adventure, after they knew exactly what was going on, they got in contact with the rival Yakuza family and offered them information in exchange for holding off kidnapping the daughter till after the 3 weeks were done. So they got paid and sidestepped the last few obstacles. It was twisted (especially since some of them became friendly with the daughter) but also brilliant. It\u2019s also a temporary solutions as there are enough loose ends that can come back to haunt them next game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiction wise\u2026 fun! Game wise\u2026 exhausting.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone\u2019s play styles are so different and habits so ingrained after 2 decades playing, yet everyone plays together because we\u2019re great friends. But if we were strangers looking for a gaming group, not everyone would likely be playing together. The other issue is that there are so many of us connected to this group. 3 people could show up\u2026 or 12! Logistically it\u2019s not hard to limit the number of players beforehand. But the variety of people playing, with all very different styles and ideas of immersion is daunting. The group has high GM turnover (which alternatively is cool since so many of us have GMed) since the GM has to work extra hard to compensate for that the game system can\u2019t possibly do, service all these sometimes very contradictory player needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, my desire to hack together a custom game for this group is probably an unachievable task. But I\u2019ll need to take a few days to weigh the pros and cons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273650/#Comment_273650" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T10:34:38+00:00" title="May 30, 2010 10:34AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br><br>Given the details of the fiction, I'd be all about flips with nunchucks.

In exchange for them giving you all the twists and glitches that make GMing more fun for you, you give them resources that'll help them win the finale.

In some specific limited cases it may be minor disabilities that interfere with certain kinds of abstract thinking and ability to focus. But a lot of it is ingrained habits. Almost 2 decades of assumptions is a huge hurdle to overcome! And I think in some cases it isn't a hurdle that everyone wants to overcome. Gaming is fun for them, sometimes in very nostalgic ways... even the problem areas! <br/><br/>This didn't happen at our Shadowrun game but at the Gotham Gaming Guild, I've seen people come back to roleplaying after 10 years away and miss the rules fighting! 2 people would argue about the interpretation of a rule and the returning player would feel happy!

I think partially because of the extensive gear lists and sub mechanics. A lot of military experts worked on the game over the years. The car rules in version 3 even had stats for fuel efficiency! <br/><br/>But the adventure I ran is fairly typical of the official published adventures. It can be seemingly goofy but many take it very seriously. That said, some people can't take any game seriously that has magic, elfs, dwarfs, and halflings.

There are 12+ people total. It just happened that only 1 person was there this time that represented the no meta sub-group! <br/><br/>I spoke to people who have GMed for this group before and they said what helps them deal with the challenge and exhaustion is to simply use different rules for different people. <br/><br/>No matter what game they are running, when they have "no meta" players who don't like obvious rules... the GM rolls percentage dice for them (no matter what dice system the game uses). It looks like you have a 75% chance... that's it! The player makes requests and the GM just tells them what happens using a percentage roll to guide them. And when the results seem unrealistic... you had a 90% chance but still failed... the GM makes up a reason for failure that has nothing to do with the player's actions. <br/><br/>And then everyone else uses the rules as normal. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I'm also curious about when you said, in the other game, that the boardgamers tried to game the system.  Was that fun, or did it ruin the fun, and if the latter, what did you do to stop the fun-ruining?</blockquote>\nIt was awesome. In almost every case where I've played with hard core board and card gamers... it's been a pleasure. If the system is setup where gaming it means awesome engaging fiction... then it works well! The few problems I've had is where such a player uses NPCs as resources rather than relationships. It's not common but has happened. And its only a problem when someone betrays their best friend because it gives them a bonus but there is no fictional explanation. It's been rare so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274977/#Comment_274977" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T08:47:59+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  8:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I spoke to people who have GMed for this group before and they said what helps them deal with the challenge and exhaustion is to simply use different rules for different people.<br/><br/>No matter what game they are running, when they have "no meta" players who don't like obvious rules... the GM rolls percentage dice for them . . .<br/>And then everyone else uses the rules as normal.</blockquote>Whoa.

I think instead it will unclutter the life of any GM to give them enough room to build their own improv skills. Essentially, it supports GMs who want to improv by giving them flexible, low handling time tools without resorting to freeform and while maintaining a consistent structure.<br/><br/>We also played again today!

It's essentially a light hearted modern Shadowrun game. It infected the group! All of a sudden people weren't backstabbing, blood thirsty sociopaths!<br/><br/>It helped that I took a few pages out of Apocalypse World and Mouse Guard. Before the new mission, we spent time following each PC living their day to day lives which injected much needed humanity into the whole affair. <br/><br/>We discussed the game mechanics again, made a few changes, and then played out a mission. <br/><br/>Players describe actions, GM sets difficulty but the player doesn't have to beat that difficulty. Say the difficulty is 3. The GM slides 3d6 with the 1 sides face up towards the player before they roll. The player rolls, and adds any 1s to the GM's pool of 1s. The pool of 1s counts as the test's difficulty AND the test's Glitches. Then the player spends rolled Hits as desired. <br/><br/>They can choose to completely ignore all the Glitches on the table or use Hits to cancel them. So in effect, success is in their hands. Failure is really just consequences which are clearly visually represented. Their characters can act carefully, using Hits to cancel Glitches or throw caution to the wind and use their Hits to bolster the effects of their desired actions. It worked great!<br/><br/>The 1 player who would rather fail than suffer consequences or twists was still very guarded but less so. Everyone else was now much more inclined to play dangerously. And the game was a lot more fun for it! <br/><br/>The other big change we made was with helping. We were using Mouse Guard helping where Stats can help Stats and Skills can help Skills. In play, in this game and in Mouse Guard, they hated helping other players with Stats. They kept saying it felt cheap, even when I made them justify it every time fictionally. But helping with Skills (or in our Shadowrun hack... traits) they loved! <br/><br/>We also finally got in enough fights where spending Money was crucial to recover from major injuries. One person elected to get cyberware instead of paying to heal naturally. Fictionally healing was off the charts fun. And the money currency is starting to really drive play. <br/><br/>Overall a pleasant experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275803/#Comment_275803" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T08:09:17+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  8:09AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot another breakthrough last night!<br/><br/>Many of our no or little meta players have difficulty with trait like mechanics from games like Mouse Guard. Where you hurt yourself now for a benefit later. They understand it, and will begrudgingly use it but you can see their faces twist and turn. But strangely, flipping the dynamic changed everything!<br/><br/>As an experiment, and because I've never done it before, I added a mechanic where players can gain a benefit now to be hurt later. And they jumped all over it!<br/><br/>At first I thought it worked because the "hurting" part was shifted back to the GM. But many of the players volunteered to hurt themselves later in the mission or after the mission. And the ones that didn't, I got to make their lives difficult which they seemed to enjoy... although 1 player stated that next time he would be sure to hurt himself before the GM could have a chance! It also created an interesting dynamic. Players who used this mechanic would have successful missions and then play out awful things happening to them in their personal lives. It became entertainingly tragic. <br/><br/>This success was also strange because even the player who would rather fail in Mouse Guard rather than suffer a condition or twist, was ok with it. It seems having the condition or twist not be immediate was the tipping point. We'll definitely have to try this out more! <br/><br/>I love experimenting! <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275810/#Comment_275810" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T09:27:08+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  9:27AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you enforce any particular criteria for what qualified as a "hurt"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275814/#Comment_275814" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T10:11:24+00:00" title="June 13, 2010 10:11AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're playstorming it for 2 sessions to determine what works or doesn't work, and then formalizing it.

Players who are ok with some meta or are very opinionated about certain areas of knowledge LOVE it! Players who are not HATE it! It's very polarizing. And with people who love it, it works smoothly and the fiction is really enhanced by the added details. But the people who don't think that way shut down and feel alienated. It's divisive. <br/><br/><b>Traits that hurt you:</b><br/><br/>In games like Mouse Guard, you can use Traits to help and hurt yourself. Helping gives you bonuses. Hurting gives you penalties but helps you later in the game. Specifically in Mouse Guard, help later means earning extra scenes for the Player's Turn (essentially you can do more personal stuff after missions, like heal, make friends, buy gear). So my character has the Tough trait. Normally Tough means I can wrestle larger opponents, last long in fights, resist pain and more. But sometimes being Tough means accidentally hurting friends or being insensitive or pretty much anything where Tough disadvantages me. When I use a Trait against myself, it gives me a penalty to a roll now but I gain extra scenes later. <br/><br/>Generalizing to any game, it's a system where you use a part of your character against yourself to gain an advantage later. Lose now, win later. But in some games, you can't just take a penalty for any reason. It has to make sense in the fiction. And its a great opportunity to roleplay flaws. This is where Traits come in and are related to the "Hurt" examples above.<br/><br/>What we experimented with last night was very different than the above (and unrelated to Traits). You can help yourself now by getting lucky at the cost of being hurt later when your past catches up with you. <br/><br/><b>Why does it feel cheap to help with stats and not skills?</b><br/><br/>In a game like Mouse Guard, if you are making a Resources Stat test, anyone with Resources (which is usually everyone) can help you. If you are making a Pathfinder Skill test, anyone can help with a variety of Skills including the same Skill (Pathfinder) or related Skills (Scout, Hunter, Weather Watcher) or appropriate Wises (Wisdom Skills) where situationally appropriate (forest-wise, cave-wise, path-wise, winter-wise and so on). In all cases you have to explain how you are helping in the fiction. And help has a cost, if the person fails, you may also suffer consequences. <br/><br/>Some players feel weird using Stats to help Stats. I don't understand it fully myself. But the reason using skills seems less of an issue, especially wises, is that they feel more specific to the character. Everyone has the same stats but not everyone has the same skills and especially wises. So when they help, they feel special because they are doing something unique. But just helping with the same exact Stat causes them issues. Which I don't think is a meta vs. non meta issue. <br/><br/>Although when I've played with people with minimal RPG experience, this is a non issue (to be fair, almost everything is a non issue as long as non-gamers don't have to talk in funny voices, memorize pages and pages of rules, the game matches their comfort level for crunchy numeric calculations, and there is enough color to help them imagine the situations).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275825/#Comment_275825" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T13:55:01+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  1:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps stats are too "passive"?

When you help, in games like Mouse Guard, you can help with 1d6 regardless of how many d6s your Stat/Skill is worth (if your Health if 5d6, you still only help with 1d6). <br/><br/>In debriefing after one of the games, I found out that 2 of the players felt good about helping with Traits because Traits already just give you a +1d6, so extending that to helping others was an easy mental leap to make since it is always a single d6 in play, regardless if you help yourself or someone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275888/#Comment_275888" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T06:00:39+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  6:00AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2010 6:42AM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished reading <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/unbreakable/" rel="nofollow">Unbreakable?</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI think it outlines a few examples of what is happening in our games. Some of the players don't want to play a game, they want to relive fictional stories they've read or daydreamed about. Because that is so personal, their sense of disbelief is very specific and possible not shared with the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you play a pure game, the expectation of sense of disbelief is often replaced with expectations of sense of balance and fairness. But the expectations of story, playing roles in fictional worlds, and probably the biggest barrier... emulation of specific fictional forces (hell, you can almost include their subjective perceptions of reality in that category)... it becomes a delicate balancing act where someone is going to be disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's probably examples of preplay creating unsupported expectations with ever increasing disparity the more people are involved with their own unique expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275894/#Comment_275894" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T06:25:50+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  6:25AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br><br>That's a powerful observation.

I like "badass with a side of tragedy"!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>playing together for a long period of time helps establish common expectations.</blockquote>\nTotally agree! I think one thing we've been bumping into is that many of the players play in different groups with some of the same players. So sometimes expectations from different games leaks in because of familiar faces, even if it isn't the same game. <br/><br/>The other thing I've noticed is having a consistent day, time, and place where you play helps strengthen communal expectations. We haven't been consistent in any of those which I think is a subtle but potentially powerful obstacle.

I realize its four years old but I wanted to chime in on it anyway.<br/><br/>One of our longest-running, and most beloved traditions is playing rpgs using ourselves as the characters. We've done it in nearly every game we've played at least once. This has a very interesting impact on their playstyles. What's more, the game ends up having a significant impact on their awareness of the fragility of their reality. Most come to understand that when faced with certain situations they may well be capable of behaving similarly to the characters in the fiction they enjoy. It also usually leads them to become better, more immersed roleplayers with characters they create next time. Having experienced acting as themselves, and understanding it, they are better able to act as __________, and understand that as well. It's the old Stanislovski vs Strasberg dichotomy.<br/><br/>I bring this up because I'm currently doing two SR games where the players are running themselves as characters. I wrote a short novel of introduction to the world and game from the standpoint of the players (presuming they had never read a word of the game otherwise). In it I explain how they were essentially put into suspended animation/cryogenics (don't overthink it, merely a plot device) and awoke IN the world described in Shadowrun. Being from another time, and being hunted mercilessly if their identities are ever discovered, gives them the perfect backstory to becoming runners. They simply have no good alternatives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11960/running-shadowrun-for-real-life-shadowrunners-is-hard/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11960/running-shadowrun-for-real-life-shadowrunners-is-hard">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11960/running-shadowrun-for-real-life-shadowrunners-is-hard/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11960/running-shadowrun-for-real-life-shadowrunners-is-hard/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11960/running-shadowrun-for-real-life-shadowrunners-is-hard/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11960%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11960%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
