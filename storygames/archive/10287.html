I accidently posted this before I'd finished writing. Let me continue...<br/><br/>This was the first time we'd gone miniaturesless in a while (since, I dunno, a game of Kobolds Ate my Baby about a year ago?) but the arena system worked pretty well for helping everyone visualize the action. i was pretty concerned that the awesome points wouldn't get much play since sacrificing attacks to get them might not appeal to my players, but without the direct focus on "combat tactics" that they're used to with D&amp;D, I guess they didn't mind so much.<br/><br/>I threw together an adventure beforehand (I was excited enough about playing it that I really wanted to prep the session pretty thoroughly) and so I three together the three chapter arc that Eric recommends in the rules, and decided each chapter would have an NPC, a monster (or group of monsters) and a treasure, with relationships between each of them. Also each chapter was supposed to have some bangs but I didn't manage to figure out what those would all necessarily be.<br/><br/>After character generation, which everyone seemed to really enjoy a lot - I think the class talents make Red Box Hack really easy to fall in love with right off the bat - the characters started the game on a sandship that was crossing a great desert to a town that they heard was the doorway to a "kingdom of gold", also known as "the town on the edge of forever".<br/><br/>The first chapter involved the journey on the sandship as it was attacked by desert bandits riding these giant wasps, so the game basically started off with a bang, I wanted to ensure that everyone got a hang of the combat system.<br/><br/>The characters:<ul>\n<li><b>Wazak</b> - a mighty ronin samurai Warrior with a soul-bonded weapon he called "Heartsbane Bloodclaw the Bloodthirsty".</li>\n<li><b>Ezmerelda</b> - a crazy old Mystic who occasional got augury advice from the taxidermied dog she carried around on wheels (called "buddy").</li>\n<li><b>Sir Chatsworth</b> - an easily excitable flying Fox with a rapier and what he insisted was a "cloak of invisibility". It didn't really work.</li>\n<li><b>Skipper</b> - A young Magus with an itchy trigger finger and a magic compass.</li>\n<li><b>Dr. Mister Mip</b> - A Bear with a fez and a harmonica who seemed to think he was in a Sergio Leone western.</li>\n</ul>\nWhen they reached Brokenfalls, the town on the edge of forever, that found that it was built on the edge of a great cliff that stretched off in either direction, over which could be seen a vast ocean of mists. A great cloud-whale warship was seen docked at the highest tower and they soon found out from the locals (in a tavern) that the town had been taken over by the great Opal Dynasty, a vast empire that came from the islands of land that existed out in the mists.<br/><br/>The soldiers of the dynasty had cut off all trade and import and export and had stolen the treasures from the tower the warship was docked too. The PCs also talked to an airship captain (one of the embargoed ships) for passage to the kingdom and found that he had been locked down until he could get papers of passage from the General aboard the warship.<br/><br/>Deciding to just generally "cause trouble" for the soldiers (they had heard of an underground organization known as the Crimson Path but didn't know how to get ahold of them, and this seemed as good a way as any) they waylaid one of the tariff officers and his goons and had a very exciting fight in some back-alleys and rooftops. Sure enough, they were then helped by some Crimson Path folks and tasked to climb the tower and rescue the Chrysm gemstones that had been taken aboard the great warship.<br/><br/>The climb up the tower required subterfuge and quick wits, the sneaking into the war-structures draped over the back of the giant cloud-whale required some canny disguise and some dispatching of guards, and the final fight with General Molla-Taka-Tavi in his quarters aboard the warship held some fun surprises as sorcerous powers were revealed as well as some sort of funny connection between the Opal Empire and the Mists.<br/><br/>Finally, the warship ended up being destroyed and the Empire driven off, for now, with the treasures recovered. It was a hell of a session, one of the best ever, and running it I really got to challenge myself creatively and come up with a lot of fun stuff on the fly.<br/><br/>Props to Eric and his guys for coming up with such a simple but fun-inducing system! If any of you have been thinking about trying to put together a RBH session or two, I highly recommend it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228774/#Comment_228774" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T14:10:52+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  2:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you end up putting in any of the hacks you'd previously mentioned you desired?
