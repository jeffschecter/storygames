The four brothers of the O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Connor family are:<br/><br/>Isaac: oldest with a family of his own. Very much following in his father\xe2\u20ac\u2122s footsteps and the glue that holds the family together once their father is out of the picture. <br/><br/>Roy O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Connor: The twin of Kenneth, he is a bit of a playboy without the resources to back it up. Does a bit of drug dealing on the side and has a fear that his fianc\xc3\xa9e will find out about his illicit activities.<br/><br/>Kenneth: The mores successful of the twins he has found himself rising in the ranks of the Cosa Nostra through his work as a lawyer. Selfish with strong code of self preservation he is the most likely to turn on the brothers for personal reasons.<br/><br/>Aaron: The youngest of the brothers and a bit of a street punk, he is involved at low levels with the Irish and Italian gangs. A bit selfish like Kenneth but idolises Isaac.<br/><br/>You can find fuller descriptions of the brother\xe2\u20ac\u2122s <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/647" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>As there were only 3 players we used Kenneth, Roy and Isaac. Aaron was assumed to not exist rather than leaving a floating character that we would have to explain the absence of.<br/><br/><b>And they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re off</b><br/><br/>As with the morning game, the scenario starts off in the alleyway behind \xe2\u20ac\u02dcFat Sam\xe2\u20ac\u2122s\xe2\u20ac\u2122 in Chicago, the family\xe2\u20ac\u2122s favourite restaurant. The corpse of their father discovered, the brother\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hear sirens in the distance, approaching quickly. They get their mother into a car and shepherd her off. In the meantime Isaac rings his police contact and gets him put on the case, guaranteeing their father\xe2\u20ac\u2122s body will be safe.<br/><br/>Shortly after they speed from the scene a contact rings Roy telling him that there is a hit out on their father. A little late it would seem. The brother\xe2\u20ac\u2122s set about getting their father\xe2\u20ac\u2122s men together to establish their loyalty. An hour late most of their father\xe2\u20ac\u2122s men are at one of his pub\xe2\u20ac\u2122s. The few missing are of no importance. As they are questioned they remain tight lipped. The hitman calls Roy again giving him a name \xe2\u20ac\u02dcO\xe2\u20ac\u2122leary\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and some details about an Irish-Italian alliance forming in the city\xe2\u20ac\u2122s underworld. The next day Kenneth sets out to buying up O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Leary\xe2\u20ac\u2122s businesses which we dealt with in a narrative rather than mechanical fashion. I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to touch on the network rules in such a limited context. It was an unexpected if interesting move by the player.<br/><br/>They try to get a hold of O\xe2\u20ac\u2122leary and find they can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t and set about putting the rumour out that he is dead. Thing is he is. Along with his family. They turn to the Irish community for answers.<br/><br/>Kenneth and Isaac try to call a meeting of the Irish gang leaders only to discover that they are all \xe2\u20ac\u02dcotherwise engaged\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and too busy to meet. Roy meanwhile has headed to the Jailbird, a mafia controlled speakeasy in the posher end of town, only to witness a procession of Irish gang leaders making their way into the joint. Roy informs his brother\xe2\u20ac\u2122s of this and they make their way to the jailbird.<br/><br/>Greeted at the Jailbird by a bouncer with a rather knowing smile they are shown through to a tiny booth where an old mafia gentlemen essentially employs them to whack the guy who whacked their dad. This Mafioso who killed their father, Correlli,  is a young turk who is gunning for the boss of the city, a friend of this gentleman. In return he will protect their business as the Italians expand. They agree, reluctantly.<br/><br/>As they are about to leave they get a phone call that someone has their mother and a location to meet at. They head to the location and Kenneth enters alone. He is about to cut a deal, turn to the Italians and shoot his mother when roy follows him in and he chooses to change tact, playing on his high loyalty to roy, and taking his mother and leaving. The figure, who has been silhouetted the whole time, makes Kenneth promise to not interfere any further in what is going on. This he agrees to and leaves with his mother in tow. <br/><br/>Kenneth is hit very hard by his tell for his mother, reducing his stature to 0 with the Irish gangs. Visibly shaken he heads back to his office to drink and consider his next move. Isaac chose not join the brothers to get their mother, instead setting up the attack on Corelli, and also gets hit by his tell to his mother, reducing his reputation temporarily as he has \xe2\u20ac\u02dcfamily man\xe2\u20ac\u2122 as one of his descriptors. <br/><br/>Isaac and Roy decide to go after Corelli, whilst Kenneth is broken by his failure to carry through his plans. As the brothers call in favours, get their resources together and plan their attack, Kenneth calls Corelli moments before they break in and warns him they are coming. <br/><br/>However the warning has come too late. The various men Isaac and Roy have collected take out Corelli\xe2\u20ac\u2122s men in the surrounding area and they burst through the door. Corelli is sitting quite confident behind a poker table and before he gets a chance to speak they plug him. His men fire back and a gun battle ensues leaving Roy a bit worst for wear, but the Mafia more so. As a thank you to the mafia they firebomb the place as they leave, walking away bathed in the light of the burning building, satisfied in their quest for immediate vengeance.<br/><br/>Pursuing their brother, who they now know has turned tale, they find he has drained their fathers finances and fled for Mexico. The fallout of the scenario was the remaining brothers look to re-establish themselves using their new \xe2\u20ac\u02dcfriend\xe2\u20ac\u2122 in the mafia to takeover the irish quarter. This is an entire campaign in itself as they rise the ranks, destroying what has gone before and making a new world order. <br/><br/>We decided that they sent a hitman after their brother, who is eventually found and killed as he sips his last pina colada on a beach somewhere. <br/><br/><b>General afterthoughts</b><br/>I had a blast running this game and it restored my faith in my ability to run interesting games that are engaging for the players. It was very social, apart from the end, and I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t decide whether that was because of the way the players approached it or the way I ran it. I may include more opportunity for a more \xe2\u20ac\u02dcdirect\xe2\u20ac\u2122 approach in the full scenario pack. Below are some specifics of the good and bad from the game.<br/><br/><b>Things that went well</b><br/><br/>Drip feeding the system was great, starting them with decisions and then introducing skirmishes when appropriate. <br/><br/>All the advice on how to set things up, crisis points, bangs etc. much appreciated worked really well. <br/><br/>Playing bangs off their tells and loyalties taught them the mechanical consequences of narrative decisions. I would like to include more of this in future games balancing the characters own personal needs against those of the community around them.<br/><br/><b>Things I would have done differently</b><br/><br/>I should have turned the promise from Kenneth into a code, at low level, for Neil. I just forgot to at the time. This will be rectified in the fully written scenario.<br/><br/>Ended the scenario with corelli still alive though I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t quite figured out how to do that so it is a satisfying ending to the game for the player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s. I would have preferred them not to get him but couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t see the end without him dead. One suggestion was to foucs the ending on the betrayal by Kenneth giving the brother\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a choice between getting vengeance on Corelli or their brother, but not both. <br/><br/>Any feedback and suggestions welcome.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105313/#Comment_105313" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T07:14:31+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  7:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They turn to the Irish community for answers.<br/><br/>We only have questions: why is the drink so expensive here?<br/><br/>Really good AP, especially where you want to take this scenario,<br/><br/>I was struck that in lots of these APs, we discuss the characters and what you saw in them, but not the players.

They all grabbed onto the initial crisis and ran with it, really getting into the fact that their father had just been killed and they had basically just inherited his business. In future games I want to emphasise the fact that their father is this big Irish gang boss and they have inherited his reponsibilities in a fashion. <br/><br/>They threw some curve balls my way, in the form of gathering the men together and buying up property but nothing absolutely crazy. They all had their little moments which was nice, the pinnacle being Neil's character almost shooting their mother in the head and swapping sides. The fallout from that conflict made the game for me.<br/><br/>We took a break at the right moment and I think I managed to keep them interested all the way through, and I took away some ideas on how to run future games.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105558/#Comment_105558" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T12:54:59+00:00" title="October 30, 2007 12:54PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, what was the story-chip economy like. How did it ebb and flow, and how did you put more chips into the scenes?<br/><br/>I ran the game at GaelCon, it was superb, and the flow of story chips really drove the story. Interestingly the mobsters in the game at GaelCon got beaten by the cops (luck of the draw and a slightly botched plan of attack doomed them!) and the cops were able to spirit the witness away alive. That was really satisfying to the players even though their mobsters failed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105745/#Comment_105745" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T13:30:59+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  1:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't involve it nearly as much as I should have to be honest, which is one of many adjustements I will be making to the scenraio. They were mainly used to start conflicts and do a little bit of stuff with reputation and stature, but not much in the way of world creation. I think one of the things that stopped me brining them in more, was that all of the players were unfamiliar with poker hands, leading to more resolution time. I just didn't want to throw something else on top of that.<br/><br/>In future though I plan to bring them into play a lot more, any advice on how you introduced the players to how to use them will be taken on board.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
