The conflicts were interesting and diverse, but the orcs grew steadily less important for the campaign as we played on; the game took us in other directions. However; as part of the theme the orcs worked very well, and made for a significant part of the overall feel of the game. To have orcs as a source of anxiety, a strange element, provocative and angry (at being turned out of their own land), worked very well. The players displayed a variety of feelings towards "the green people", ranging from "kill them all" to "let them be, they are peaceful cattle-hunters". Some were involved in conflicts with the orcs, and was free to make choices on how to solve them (both violence and negotiations were chosen). It was four nice campaigns, with 33 sessions in each. Playing this kind of conflict was clearly something the players enjoyed, and found challenging. In my eyes that is good!<br/><br/>This summer I ran an intense "summer-campaign", with ten sessions within a week, for three parallel groups. The setting was ruled by women, suppressing the men with a hard hand. The characters were central in a peoples march to a new land, and when they came there their traditional thinking were challenged. It ended in a very beautiful way; two mighty characters got married (first time in this setting), and ruled together, and they surprised me by wording a constitution (yes, really!), were men and women were grated equal rights. Having them claiming the setting in this way, was a moment of pure beauty to me! A moment I will treasure for years to come!<br/><br/>To play with serious themes, and have players explore and make meaningful choices in relation to them, is a great source to exciting role-playing, great scenes, and touching characterization. It never fails to deliver moments of pure, human beauty! And sometimes brutal cruelty too! <br/><br/>It is something I recommend for all grown up players.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387962/#Comment_387962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T15:19:28+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  3:19PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>It is something I recommend for all grown up players.</blockquote>\nThus my endless struggle to to explain to my peers what a theme is and how it relates to rolling dice and talking in funny voices.

Having a group like that is hard, and something I have experienced. I have led my friends in rpg-campaigns for nearly a decade, and them being old-school players, I never used this approach with them. At least not to the same effect that I do in my other groups.<br/><br/>I play professionally, with a lot of groups, a lot of new players each fall (following me through the winter, in 30+ sessions campaigns). When doing this, the theme and mood of the game is set by the way I lead the group. The players will follow my cues, easily, when the group is not settled in a certain style. The style will be moulded to suit the theme, not the other way around. I do this with children (10 and up), youths and adults. The result is the same; fun gaming, interesting conflicts, engagement from the players. <br/><br/>It is important that I use a game that suits the purpose; a game that has been developed for over 15 years to support most kinds of game-play and themes, with a method that includes broad-spectred dialogue-techniques and really fast and crunchy mechanics (it's the fantasy RPG Fabula, in Norwegian, sry) . Playing the old classical games (D&amp;D, Warhammer, Call, MERP, GURPS) makes this kind of approach harder (but not impossible). <br/><br/>I would recommend that you try out NEW PLAYERS! If your old ones don't follow your dreams of what a role-playing game can be, a group of new players may make all the difference. Make sure you get some players that really want to do some serious exploring, playing with themes on the fringe, or with new point-of-view on old themes. <br/><i>Do continue with the old group too, if you like, to keep your friends. That is; if they really are your friends, and not some haphazard group you got sucked into some years ago (I have chosen not to play on with my old group, ultimately. Last winter I chose to leave them; the group was broken anyway, and not very interesting).</i><br/><br/>And I do recommend that you try out some of the new games on the market now, like Apocalypse World and 3:16, and others that make game-play easier and faster. Resolution speed is important; it gives more space to the dialogue, and helps you develop the dialogue-techniques further. Most games is weak on dialogue-techniques, and that's a shame;<br/>- simple and effective dialogue-techniques are the real core of all role-playing games.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388002/#Comment_388002" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T00:59:48+00:00" title="August 24, 2012 12:59AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my loose thoughts as of the moment:<br/><br/>* Be upfront about what kind of play you want with the game, and if they say they're not into it, don't sweat it. You can find other people to play with (probably). Dishonesty isn't cool, and neither is beating someone over the head with a playstyle they're disinterested in.<br/>* If they say they're game, but aren't sure how to go about it, tell them just how easy it really is: all you have to do is make an interesting character and play them to the best of your ability. That's it, honest.<br/>* All things considered, the large majority of teenagers will not give a shit about orcs and their feelings. That's okay. Meanwhile I will keep a keen eye for the rare ones that might, maybe chat them up about that, and see if they'd like to play these weird rolling-dice-and-talking-funny games with me.<br/>* "Serious" roleplaying is, and probably always will be, a niche hobby. But it's a rewarding one, so I'll keep looking for opportunities.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388015/#Comment_388015" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T05:32:40+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  5:32AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had similar situations where players committed atrocities and shrugged. When there was a massive uproar in the game world at their actions they were stunned. Nearly the whole world turned against them and they realized that kind of thing just shouldn't happen.<br/><br/>If in the world you play, say orcs are hated, well it might be harder to pull that off. But if all Orcs suddenly get a hatred bonus when they identify the players and call in reinforcements the players will know they did something to bother them. They may like that though until it starts to get painful.<br/><br/>If the world you play is at all tolerant and the orcs might have some kind of dialogue with the humans (or whatever) have the orc warboss go to the human village elders and tell them if they don't hand over the PCs they'll attack the village. When the player's allies turn against them because they've become inconvenient they'll get annoyed.<br/><br/>When they complain you explain why they made the enemies they did.

In my game Fabula I have a social skill, and the strength of this skill may force characters to behave. The logic is this; your social skill is a measure of how socially adapted you are, so if it is high you are less likely to go against social tradition. <br/><br/>If the player want the character to do something outrageous, you force a skill-test on the social skill. If it succeeds the character will NOT do the intended thing, but shake his/her head on the foolish tought, and go about doing "the right thing". And the player has to play along. "Playing along" is as easy as playing along with the result of other skill tests, so don't make it into something special. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388028/#Comment_388028" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T06:23:09+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  6:23AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry, but the ZOMG Orc Babies! thing doesn't count as a "serious theme."

I'm trying an experiment germane to this discussion right now...<br/><br/>So: I've got this group that mostly plays traditional games. We've got five members, whom I will describe in a frank and hyperbolic manner:<br/><br/>1) Amateur Thespian- This guy has really stepped up his game in the last year or so, and gotten incredibly serious-minded about his characters. It's bizaare that he's become Amateur Thespian, because when I started playing with him, oh, eight years ago, he was The Powergamer. Either way, most hope for serious roleplaying for him. His improvement/skill is what convinced me I could actually give this serious game thing a shot with this group.<br/>2) Literature Major- Tries really hard to play the game, and makes interesting characters, but forgets that he made them interesting and falls into a pattern of behavior. He used to be terrible at improvising and has recently improved, which was the second impetus for give this a try. This guy has stepped up to Literature Major from GM Attention Hog. He has the most potential to become a serious player, because he loves serious themes in his fiction. He has an unfortunate tendency to turtle up and do nothing sometimes, if he can't think of a course of action.<br/>3) White Hat- Only plays paladins. He's a decent roleplayer when he's into his character, but has a really obstinate thought pattern that can obstruct play. Luckily, the system we're playing (Burning Wheel) has a mechanic for dealing with social conflict in the party. If there's a disagreement, we can have a Duel of Wits and move on. White Hat will get swept up in the zeitgeist of the rest of the group: if everyone else is roleplaying, then White Hat roleplays. If everyone else isn't then he goes to sleep on the couch. White Hat is less mature than other folks, but likes to play more mature characters. It's a hard toss up with him. White Hat used to be The Cheater, and if bad things happen to his character he sulks, and if someone else's character has a problem with his he takes it personally. These are the two habits of which we first must break him in order to achieve victory.<br/>4) Chaos Monkey- Will always play a mad scientist, arsonist, chaos wizard, what have you. Likes to burn things and pretend to "Be A Crazy Guy!" Between him and white hat, and possibly New Guy (see below), we've got the most potential for this group to fall into bad habits and sink a Serious Game. On the upshot, I was really encouraged by our recent experience with another game: Chaos Monkey played a serious-minded character with serious goals. He wants to play a leader-type character this time around. Chaos Monkey likes to make jokes - doesn't help that he's actually funny - and so sidelines as Stand Up Comedian.<br/>5) New Guy- I've never played with this guy before, but in the few sessions we've played so far he seems really into playing an interesting character. He was brought in as "a friend of a friend just moved into town! He likes RPGs!" He likes to play up the conflicts between the party with the goal of resolving them through roleplay. He gives me hope for great justice. On the other hand, he did say at the last game, when we were discussing the types of antagonists they might face, a very dangerous thing for the story-games and serious roleplaying thought police. "I don't like to know what's coming. I like to have it revealed to me." (Perhaps I need to start another thread so folks can give me advice on this.)<br/><br/>So, my plan is simple. I decided that I would create a Serious Theme that these guys would like - it's the Serious Theme that is rarely taken seriously in many traditional games: "When the old status quo tumbles, it is up to people with principles and the best of intentions to do something, for if they do nothing then bad people will profit and the world will be an ill place for freedom and love."<br/><br/>I've made it clear to the players that if they don't get out there and do The Right Thing (or, what their characters believe is the right thing) the world will fall down around them, the bad old ways will come back, and generally people will be oppressed and enslaved for who they are and what they believe. They've said they're on board and that it sounds like fun. I, for my part, have taken great pains to not let the veneer of the serious fall from any minute detail of the world.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough that my first step in doing this was to go and talk to the players: If they're relatively mature, and if they're adults, then probably they understand what you're trying to do. Their subconscious knows they like Serious Themes - no, really, it does - because they probably like a book or TV show or movie that has serious themes. Similarly, I think that somewhere in the back of their minds they've got the basics of how to play a serious character. They've got that knowledge because they've absorbed it from media. They know when things are out of character, and I think it's okay to (very gently) remind them that you're not sure that a given course of action is in character.<br/><br/>Try it, you might be surprised. I've been surprised so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388050/#Comment_388050" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T08:07:19+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  8:07AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one important question is why people resist serious themes. <br/><br/>If they just feel that serious themes just might not be fun, they could be talked into to try.

Perhaps "serious roleplaying" for them is connected to negative strerotypes they want to avoid. Perhaps they feel vulnerable, approaching something in a serious way would mean exposing yourself emotionally. Or perhaps it more about a fear at not being good at it. Pehaos...

Whether it is comedies or tragedies, the drama gets another twist with a serious basis. If you don't believe in this, it is fine with me. I'm not here to discuss whether or not you need to have it. If you want it, fine.<br/><br/>I recommend it, as I know that going to your game-play with a shared serious intent, improves on your ability to deliver delightful and beautiful interaction.<br/><br/>The interesting question is WHY?<br/><br/>Why does <i>serious intent</i> and <i>serious content</i> increase our chances of having a blast at the table?<br/><br/>Some answers:<br/><br/>- Serious content gives relevance to the drama; it compels us to look at our own life and world through the happenings in the game<br/><br/>- Serious content gives acuity to the dilemmas; life-like dilemmas is of greater value to us, as players, and makes us work harder to find good solutions<br/><br/>- Serious content makes the setting believeable; it broadens the spectrum of possible consequences, and makes for characters that grows in complexity to mirror the setting<br/><br/>- Serious intent in players makes us share this "ritual of interaction" with a wish for something more, and makes us all work together towards higher goals<br/><br/>- Serious intent is us, as players, promising each other to invest in the game, and to do our best to make it as interesting, challenging and exciting as possible.<br/><br/>- Serious intent on the game-smith, send signals to the players that their game-play may come with surprises, and may surpass shallow genre-clichees. It opens up the playing field for new thought and initiatives.<br/><br/>Of course; this is all rather dull, if you don't see that underneath the talk of "serious" lies the very real and frightening possibility that you may come to cry, and laugh, with joy in a role-playing game of this kind. It may release some very real emotional tension in you, in a very fun way. <br/><br/>So be warned; <i>serious</i> content and intent in game-play, may take you to places unknown!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388171/#Comment_388171" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T04:03:44+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  4:03AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played "A Flower for Mara", this is a serious theme.

This is a topic that means a lot to me, but it's impossible for me to engage with because of the way you're conducting yourself. If you don't wish to change the way you're conducting yourself, that's your prerogative. But it'll carry with it the consequence of me being able contribute to the thread. Which of course you're under no obligation to care about, one way or the other.<br/><br/>I am not "relating to the persons," I am making an observation about the comments.<br/><br/>Example: Elin asked a perfectly valid question that appears grounded in experience (and has also been expressed in many others' posts as THEIR experience).\n<blockquote>I think one important question is why people resist serious themes... What is the behind the resistance?</blockquote>\nAnd your response was:\n<blockquote>Most people don't resist serious themes, or other themes. They play what is on the table, and make the best out of it. Period.</blockquote>\nThis looks to me like a flat-out dismissal of the experience of others, by way of asserting that YOUR experience trumps theirs and represents "most people." And is a non-answer to Elin's question. The closest thing I see to your addressing this experience, reported several times in this thread, is:\n<blockquote>Ah, I sympathize with you! Having a group like that is hard, and something I have experienced. I have led my friends in rpg-campaigns for nearly a decade, and them being old-school players, I never used this approach with them. At least not to the same effect that I do in my other groups.</blockquote>\nWhich DOES sort of acknowledge that the problem exists, but apparently is just solved by having the "right sort" of players, which turns it into a moral issue--"are your players badwrong jerks and clods?"--instead of a creative agreement issue.<br/><br/>So all this is telling me that if I attempt to engage in this thread, my experience will be dismissed unless it accords with your own, and any players I describe as having difficulties with will be judged inferior, as an alternative to trying to work out what the priority clashes are and addressing them as adults.<br/><br/>So, I thought, what the hell, instead of charging in and arguing, maybe I'll just point out the effect that the thread is having on me. And I've received a scolding for not doing it privately. Oh, well. I thought it was a publicly pertinent observation, and I have no regrets on that score.<br/><br/>So, is this thread a discussion on hashing out the problems and challenges with "serious roleplaying", or is it simply a forum to talk about how the way you play is super-great and wonderful?<br/><br/>Which, I guess, is a somewhat rhetorical question, because I know now that there is no way I can engage with this thread in a safe and productive way.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388605/#Comment_388605" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T13:06:48+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  1:06PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, a side conversation pointed out something to me - serious themes are in many cases those that explore real-world problems that don't have simple solutions.

You'll get people telling you that they aren't interested in that style of play - they want to be adventurers who kill evil monsters. Cool!

I do not doubt that people resist GMs forcing seriousness to their carefree adventure game-play. Don't force it; make it part of the setting, and the interplay, and let the players explore it at their own convenience.\n<blockquote>In my experience, most people disagree about what a serious theme is.  <br/><br/>In this thread, people have disagreed about what serious themes are -- orc babies being trite and such, not everyone feels that way.</blockquote>There is a way to make anything trite, and boring, and dull. Take a gung-ho action game and make it "serious"; DOH!<br/><br/>A lot of <b>game leaders</b> fail in following up their ambitions of more realism, more morally challenging situations, more serious themes ... <br/>- Why? <br/>The answer is obvious to me; they lack support for it in the games they play. The players resist bad game-play, not serious themes.\n<blockquote>In my personal experience, I get bored with some themes other people find fascinating or moving -- characters experiencing loss through their fairly unestablished families being threatened or offed is a theme I've had to play through too many times to take seriously, and it has little emotional impact on me.</blockquote>As said; there are ways to do this trite, and the very instance you mention here is the clich\xe9 of GM-ambitions failing to hit the target. suddenly he want your family to be important to you, so that he can threaten them, to make his adventure-hook interesting. But it is too shallow, and too bloody obvious! So you follow up out of loyalty, or you turn your back on "your mothers predicament" and make some silly comment. Bah!\n<blockquote>Honestly, I've usually had considerably more fun in games that didn't try to force serious themes.

My first post describes two campaign set-ups that worked like hell for the players.

Muu is a very serious and poetic fable about being a clumsy little creature called Muu. Muu have a voice, but don't use it very often. Only when in the rare ecstatic mood, may a Muu sing. <br/><br/>The game is so fun it made players fall off their chairs in the first play-test, back in may 1989. It was written by me, as a kind of autmated-writing one night I could not sleep. It is serious in a very na\xefve and cute way.<br/><br/>The man (around 30) who chose the action "Sing" with his muu, was told to stand up, go to the corner, turn, come back and sing a muu-song, with no words. A kind of humming-song, wordless and free of any real tune. This is standard procedure for anyone choosing to sing with their muu. It has never failed to be a success. <br/><br/>The man was taken completely by surprise, and refused to do it. I said it had to be done, to continue the game, and he still refused. I saw that he was adamant about it, so the game was halted for his sake, so him and me could go off in private to talk about it. <br/><br/>We sat down. He told me he could not sing, and did not want to do it. I told him fine, but let me explain my game to you. He said yes. So I explained that the game had this element; the singing, and would not be the game he had signed up for without it. I pointed out that he had chosen the song, in the game, by himself, so it was his responsibility to follow up on it. I also told him that "singing" in this game had nothing to do with ordinary singing; and that it actually was based on players being bad at singing. I told him that it was no big deal if he chose not to sing, but the game would be over, with the game-play we had had up until then. "This is your choice, and make the best choice for yourself. Do not mind me. I'm fine with ending the game, and the other players will be too." That is what I said to him, when we had talked it trough.<br/><br/>And then I left him, to decide for himself.<br/><br/>He returned to the table 5 minutes later. I smiled, asked if he was ready? He nodded. so I recapped the situation, told him to go to the cornen, turn, and sing. He did. With the most tune-less and harking voice ever heard at a muu-table, short, clumsy ...<br/>- and totally muu-like! It was a resounding success, and the other players applauded, both his courage in doing this, and his absolutely BEAUTIFUL muu-song.<br/><br/>He sat down, and was a changed man.<br/><br/>Really; he came to me after the game, shook my hand and gave me a million thanks for helping him to sing that muu-song. I told him it was the most clumsy and beautiful song I had ever heard, and he beamed at me. Glad to see you so happy, I told him, and he shone like a sun!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388630/#Comment_388630" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T15:23:05+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  3:23PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            _______________________________________<br/><br/>So, three important points on the muu/man-story:<br/><br/>1 - respect your players; SEE them; this start at once you meet up with them; take their hand and look into their eyes, one by one, to signal that "I see you"<br/><br/>2 - respect the game; if the game demand certain things of you; do it, and make sure everybody contribute in the same manner; it is how you make a game of consequence<br/><br/>3 - Be free!

In particular, I know plenty of people who swore off White Wolf games because they encouraged these themes.  <br/><br/>This doesn't mean that I'm opposed to serious themes, but I know that particularly negative issues like these can be damaging.  Also, I'd note that often players don't give feedback about problems they have.  When my ex-wife would be in games that creeped her out, the last thing she wanted to do was sit around and talk with the people responsible.  Rather she would just politely leave at the end.  I've likewise generally just want to leave after a bad experience.  <br/><br/><br/>Re: the goblin babies.  I don't recall being in the specific situation of goblin babies.  However, I have been in a number of situations where the GM would complain about casual violence by the PCs and my PC in particular.

Thank you!<br/><br/>I do understand those resisting to "injections" of serious themes; to me that is describing someone trying to put a glazing of seriousness on something silly; a praxis doomed to fail. Let us rather infuse our fiction (and our methods) from the start, with symbolism, meaning and serious/interesting/exciting themes worthy of exploration.

What they really do, is to resist the way it is introduced, by the leader of the game.<br/><br/><b>2 Game leaders failing to work their ambitions in a good way</b><br/>It is fairly common for GMs, after some years of gaming, to develop some ambitions in relation to themes and methods for their games. Often these ambitions are NOT supported by the game itself, so the GM have to reinvent his/her gaming. Most of the time this goes well, but occasionally it fails. <br/><br/>The most common field of failure is in introducing a serious theme. Such themes may be perceived as intrusive (depending on the way they are introduced), and more important; a serious theme demand a shift in attitudes from the players. A shift in attitude, with players used to playing silly/toungue-in-cheek/carefree-action for years, is not a small task. It has to be carefully wrought, and still don't stand much of a chance for success. Players set in their ways are not changed overnight. <br/><br/>But most players are, by and large, open to new gaming experiences. So finding a set of players willing to explore new land with you, is not a impossible task. Finding a GM with more guts than your old one, can be a more difficult task, but the web should make it possible, if you want more from your gaming than the old jibes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388667/#Comment_388667" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T03:39:53+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  3:39AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The man (around 30) who chose the action "Sing" with his muu, was told to stand up, go to the corner, turn, come back and sing a muu-song, with no words.

It has never failed to be a success. <br/><br/>The man was taken completely by surprise, and refused to do it. I said it had to be done, to continue the game, and he still refused. I saw that he was adamant about it, so the game was halted for his sake, so him and me could go off in private to talk about it. <br/><br/>We sat down. He told me he could not sing, and did not want to do it. I told him fine, but let me explain my game to you. He said yes. So I explained that the game had this element; the singing, and would not be the game he had signed up for without it. I pointed out that he had chosen the song, in the game, by himself, so it was his responsibility to follow up on it. I also told him that "singing" in this game had nothing to do with ordinary singing; and that it actually was based on players being bad at singing. <b>I told him that it was no big deal if he chose not to sing, but the game would be over, with the game-play we had had up until then. </b>"This is your choice, and make the best choice for yourself. Do not mind me. I'm fine with ending the game, and the other players will be too."

I would definitely not thank you for this. I would likely not play in your game again. I do not appreciate being bullied. It is exactly the same as saying "Fine, if you do not play the way I want to, I am going to take my ball and go home." It is holding the game hostage to your personal vision. It is something that most people get over in about 3rd grade. It is also not conducive to mature play. I have been in these types of games.

I would never just put rape, genocide or bullying on the table and expect the players to just play along. When you, Tomas, said this:\n<blockquote>Most people don't resist serious themes, or other themes. They play what is on the table, and make the best out of it. Period.</blockquote>\n...it kind of raised red flags for me. If I got blindsided with heavy themes, I'd be pretty angry. Serious themes might be healthy, like broccoli, but I'm 36 years old and I'll damn well decide whether or not I feel like eating broccoli! A game master putting broccoli on the table, and demanding that the players eat it, is treating the players like children. Like they would eat ice cream for dinner every day without an adult telling them what to eat. I wouldn't stand for it! And the funny thing is, if I get to choose freely, I'll happily play with all sorts of exceedingly serious themes!<br/><br/>By the way, when a game is in progress, telling people that they will be spoiling everyone else's fun by walking away amounts to emotional coercion.

So in my Smallville game, I had a character who was victimized by prejudice and then she acts out viciously in response. This is a serious issue  and I presented it seriously.  But the players had some leeway in whether, when and how to respond. It wasn't like a "bang" (please destroy this jargon, it has never been good) where you simply can't ignore it. They could ignore it and keep their heads down if they wanted.  Or they could caretake the victims and not address the abusers. Or they could handle the abusers but let the victims fend for themselves. This was presented more or less to establish the reality of anti-mutant prejudice, not to create a plotline or put a character's values at issue unless they wanted it to.  So sometimes we'd show up and it would be about trying to get the characters' guitar back from the manager who had stolen it along with the rest of his band's gear, and sometimes, if the players wanted, it could be more serious and have fewer hijinx. Sort of like a "serious zone" within a more lighthearted campaign.<br/><br/>Making people sing, yikes. Yeah, that group would fold.  (Although I think in a convention or one-shot scenario it would be less damaging and people would be MORE likely to give it a go, not less. After all, less is at stake.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius" title="Evil Genius"><img alt="Evil Genius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/933/nIYAYGDL37TU5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius">Evil Genius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388737/#Comment_388737" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T14:11:11+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  2:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love serious themes in games - which is probably why I currently prefer story games over trad games. I know plenty of trad gamers who just want to 'kill stuff and take it's treasure'. It's hard to get some trad players to explore character depth and serious issues but many story gamers have no problem with it.<br/><br/>When playing with any group it is important to discuss lines and veils with the players as they probably will not be happy having some serious stuff forced on them if that's not their fix. If you want to play and explore serious themes then it's best to find a group that have similar tastes.<br/><br/>When I run trad games for my trad player friends I will try to introduce some serious elements and see if they are in the mood to run with it. One way to do this is to show them the consequences of their actions and the effect that 'kill it and steal it's treasure' can have in a wider context. <br/><br/>I think that if it's done slowly over a period of time it is possible to make any game more serious - to a degree.<br/><br/>I played 'A penny for my thoughts' ( a personal favourite) with some trad players not so long ago and there was a definite discomfort with the lack of control the players had over the situation - especially the lack of rules to manipulate. However, by the end, I think they found the experience rewarding and enlightening. One of them told me when we met next that he had thought about the game all week and had realised how strong the experience was.<br/><br/>So, I guess I'm saying that for it to work well, you need the right game and the right players. You can't force a square peg in to a round hole without causing some trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388740/#Comment_388740" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T14:33:38+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  2:33PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, I really think you're underestimating the impact felt by participants in the kind of situation you're describing.<br/><br/>Yes, I've seen emotional bombs go off when serious subjects are brought into role-playing, many times.  Bomb is probably the wrong word.  What I have experienced first hand, on numerous occasions is that:<br/><br/>a) Disproportionately strong feelings of shame, anger, resentment, fear, triggers from family, etc. as a reaction to the theme are all utterly commonplace.<br/><br/>b) The group rarely finds out anything clear about these feelings unless group safety is a priority, and space and time are allocated to process them.  (jhkim provided an example of this, above.)<br/><br/>c) If not processed, the impact to the group dynamic is enduring, and can remain tense or uncomfortable for affected individuals even when sessions are spaced months or years apart. (I've seen both.)<br/><br/>d) The group leader is insulated from some of negative consequences of this dynamic by virtue of their social power within the group.  (They have the authority, for example, to say what 'the rules' are.)<br/><br/>d) This power imbalance means that when the group leader is perceived as the source of the problem (e.g. through the use of tactics that undermine safety), it takes a far greater than normal amount of courage for the player to raise the issue.<br/><br/><br/>I think it might be useful to look at various meanings of 'serious'. One candidate definition might be real-world problems without a simple solution (e.g. colonial oppression).  Another candidate is that the theme involves real emotional risk for the participants.<br/><br/>I know that I could run an engaging game that explored the serious theme of colonial oppression with a small group of my white, male friends and we'd have a good time and probably learn something meaningful (however small) from the experience - it's an interesting and engaging problem with meaty consequences, and none of us have any skin in the game whatsoever.<br/><br/>With others I know who do, I don't think I have it in me to handle what's essentially <i>entertainment</i> with enough grace and sensitivity to honor the enormous pain it evokes for them.  For them, it's a risky topic, because strong feelings arise unbidden.  Not without a long, long conversation beforehand and extensively safety building, and probably not even then, because of the competing priorities for drama and safety.  I wouldn't go there.<br/><br/>Similarly, put <i>me</i> in a game about coercive authority with an even <i>slightly</i> blurry line between IC and OOC, and I'll be watching the clock and taking it up with my therapist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388741/#Comment_388741" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T14:52:43+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  2:52PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2012 2:52PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>By the way, when a game is in progress, telling people that they will be spoiling everyone else's fun by walking away amounts to emotional coercion.

If you want to talk about abuse, could you please do that in another thread?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388762/#Comment_388762" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T18:33:41+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  6:33PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is an abbreviated version. We talked for 30 minutes, and I was very careful not to bully him. I would not have achieved the result we had, with bullying. He would not have thanked me for doing that.</blockquote>\nThis is not exactly true. You both had different things at stake. For you, the game might have stalled or failed because "one player was unable to engage seriously with the theme and tone of the game. Too bad. He really could have benefitted." For him, there were several other people who he may have really wanted to retain the respect of that would look at him as the guy who couldn't do that simple thing the GM asked, and it ruined the game. And he may have been unable to make himself vulnerable enough with these new acquaintances to explain why it was extremely difficult for him to do the asked for task. Difficult enough, but yet the stakes were important enough that he engaged in a half hour talk with you about how difficult it was and the true need to engage in this task. There was a huge power differential here.\n<blockquote>Please take care; what is represented in writing, and what actually takes place between two persons, face to face, differs a lot. That is true for a lot of descriptive prose related to role-playing. It is very easy to dismiss descriptions of game-play strange to you, from truly meager descriptions on the net. Try to look behind the words, and read charitably. You will gain from it.</blockquote> Sorry Thomas, but I am left feeling that there is either a language or cultural disconnect thing here, or that you are just unable to communicate well your position, or that you just refuse to listen to other people's concerns. You seem to take this position all the time. "You will gain from it." I get that you have a great time with gaming. What I never get is that you really hear the other people you are talking at, and I somehow just get a consistent message from you. "My games are very complex, to a degree that you obviously can't understand, and your concerns about the things I wrote are unfounded because my words are imperfect. On top of that, it is your responsibility to get what I mean, despite the fact that what I say does not reflect accurately what I mean. You have much to gain from listening to me. Trust me, your concerns are not a problem, and my position is so complex and beyond you that you just need to trust me. I have the answers because I am a Professional, with over 25 years experience!" I know that this is a bit of an exaggeration, but this is purposeful in an effort to illustrate a feeling. Seems like it is a feeling shared by more than just myself.\n<blockquote>Another point relating to this example; if he had walked out of the game, it would still not have been any kind of "social disaster" or "emotional landmine". It would have been a player leaving the game, nothing more. I question the tendency to paint a frightening picture of serious game-play. It is not dangerous in any way. I have discussed it a lot through the years, and have been given no evidence it is.</blockquote> This would not be an "emotional landmine" for you because it was not a big deal to you. It very well may have been exactly this for your player. And the statement that you have never been given evidence that it is dangerous seems to be in question, at least from the reactions and experiences of those in this thread. Just because you are dismissive of other voices does not mean that there is no contrary evidence.<br/><br/>To me, the way to handle players who react negatively to ANYTHING in the game is to ask them what you can do to make them comfortable, accommodate, and then address them after the game. Only <i>offer</i> to help them unpack the experience, do not purport to know how to "help" them. The fact is, you do not. You can be there for them, you cannot fix them. <br/><br/>This is actually one reason that I have a strong love for GMless games. Most of the time, the social structure is such that the GM-centric power differentials get left behind. No one "owns" the game. No one can threaten to stop the game, and no one can take their ball an go home. Everyone brings the ball.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius" title="Evil Genius"><img alt="Evil Genius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/933/nIYAYGDL37TU5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius">Evil Genius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388780/#Comment_388780" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T23:09:11+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 11:09PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nameless said - <blockquote>This is actually one reason that I have a strong love for GMless games.

I'm happy to incorporate players fiction to a GM game so long as it does not alter the fundamental structure of the story too far.

It was important telling him this, in earnest, and making him see that I meant it. He himself felt the social pressure of refusing to comply, and was afraid of disappointing me and the other players (whom he did not know from before). This feeling increased the difficulty for him. I relieved him of that pressure during our talk, and helped him make a choice based on his own feelings, not ours.<br/><br/>NO<br/>- at no point was he given the impression that he did not take the game seriously.<br/>All the players, including him, engaged seriously with the theme and tone of the game. He felt bad due to the fact that he really engaged with the game. He had looked forward to playing it, and had told me so at the start of the session (this episode took place rather late in the session).<br/><br/>For me there were two <b>easy ways out</b> in the situation:<br/><br/>- 1 - <br/>I could have continued the game as if the myth of the muu-song meant nothing. That would have bereft him and the other players of the real muu-experience. I was not willing to do that. It would have compromised the game seriously.<br/><br/>- 2 - <br/>I could have let him wander off, not trying to help him into the game, cutting the situation short and concentrating on the other players. I did not have the conscience to do that. <br/><br/>I wanted to help him<br/>- so I offered to do so. He said yes to my help. That was the first thing happening after his refusal.<br/><br/>Then I told the other players to go find some grub and wait for me, and sat down with him in an undisturbed corner. We had a good talk. It helped him make a good decision, by and for himself.<br/><br/>I was adamantly conscious of him feeling very strongly about this the whole time we sat and talked about it. I did not dismiss his feelings, but acknowledged them, and let him go as deeply in describing them as he felt was necessary. As with most people, this way of showing empathy made him open up a bit, and made the whole talk possible. He showed me trust, and by being conscious and careful, while engaging with him, I earned it.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388785/#Comment_388785" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T23:40:58+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 11:40PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2012 12:19AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nameless; <br/>- you and some others want to find faults with me in this episode.

Nameless and others have not made a good job of asking questions about the episode, to clarify things. If it really interested them I reckon they would do that. They have made assumptions, and been very free in offering their interpretations about the episode, telling me that I was a bully for trying to help. <br/><br/>My main point in this is: the episode related is rare. You should not expect to have a game EXPLODE socially because of serious in-game themes.

You can find other people to play with (probably). Dishonesty isn't cool, and neither is beating someone over the head with a playstyle they're disinterested in.<br/>* If they say they're game, but aren't sure how to go about it, tell them just how easy it really is: all you have to do is make an interesting character and play them to the best of your ability. That's it, honest.<br/>* All things considered, the large majority of teenagers will not give a shit about orcs and their feelings. That's okay. Meanwhile I will keep a keen eye for the rare ones that might, maybe chat them up about that, and see if they'd like to play these weird rolling-dice-and-talking-funny games with me.<br/>* "Serious" roleplaying is, and probably always will be, a niche hobby. But it's a rewarding one, so I'll keep looking for opportunities.<br/></blockquote>Jon; I think the points you're making here are very nice!<br/><br/>My thoughts:<br/><br/>By <b>communicating</b> your scenario, you help people into the right mood. The right mood makes it easier to achieve the goals of the scenario. Serious games are much more dependent on the mood than other games.<br/><br/>About the <b>easy</b> way to do it; I normally tells my players NOT to make interesting characters. I tell them: "You make ordinary characters, and the interaction will make them interesting". My philosophy is that the true characters evolves during play, not in "character build". So most of the time we make quite banal and sketchy characters to begin with, and let them evolve during play. Some of the time, though, I make special characters for a special scenario.<br/><br/><b>Teenagers</b> are sooo hungry for excitement, and giving them hard dilemmas to solve is something they rapidly get used to finding excitement in. When all is said and done, role-playing comes down to choice and consequence, so having really hard consequences is the key to hard dilemmas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388797/#Comment_388797" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T02:32:22+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  2:32AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I could have continued the game as if the myth of the muu-song meant nothing.

Did you tell them up-front that they would have to sing and/or do other stuff that they wouldn't typically expect in a roleplaying game, and give them the option to leave <i>before</i> the game if that wasn't the kind of game they wanted to play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388833/#Comment_388833" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T10:22:36+00:00" title="August 30, 2012 10:22AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Hans; now we come into another territory; what do you say before a game is commenced?

That's an okay thing to feel upset about?  When you resign in chess, you feel bad, upset sometimes, but it's not an illegitimate feeling or something wrong with chess that refusing to play further makes you upset.  (And sometimes people get grouchy about an opponent's resignation if they were eager to pound them into oblivion.  Also not a flaw in chess.) Chess doesn't victimize people who lose chess games even though they might be mad or depressed.<br/><br/>If this guy had "resigned" the game over the singing thing, why shouldn't he feel bad or upset? If the other players had the game ended before they wanted it to end over the singing thing, they also could feel bad or upset.  Sometimes you don't like how a game comes out, but that's not (necessarily) a problem with the game or with "leadership."

It is that people avoid ending/leaving because it might upset themselves and others, and stay in games that they ought to get the fuck out of. That matters with "serious themes" because those mean that there's probably heavy stuff at stake that has the potential to be hurtful above and beyond twisted fee-fees for some people.<br/><br/>Like, say, bullying. Maybe we're playing a bullying game. And one of the players has serious bad baggage on that account. Panic-attack-inducing baggage. That's not the slightest bit implausible! So, do we stick a "there will be bullying in this game" label on it, or do we spring it as a surprise, and when the player in question succumbs to the social pressure to not spoil everyone else's fun, do we just say, "So s/he got upset? OK, not my problem". With serious themes, I ALWAYS label, and if it obviously has the potential to upset (not talking about singing moos here), I tend to formalize safety mechanisms for signalling discomfort or ejecting from scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388852/#Comment_388852" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T13:38:33+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  1:38PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's overdue that I pointed out that, as I've probably sounded like a naysayer so far, I think 'serious themes' are definitely worth pursuing.  I regularly use role-playing for personal growth, which is all about serious themes (to those involved, at least!), so some of what I've been saying comes from those experiences.  The main point I want to make is not to underestimate the emotional risk that people involved can experience, often privately.<br/><br/>I'll relate one incident from a free-form session.  What sticks in my mind about this one is the way a theme that seemed so harmless as to be beyond the possibility of offense was in fact deeply upsetting to someone.  The basic theme we started with was playfulness, and I introduced the subject of Halloween.  (I love making elaborate <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8aHu33LKxY" rel="nofollow">Halloween costumes</a>, and I was aware there were emotional drivers I wasn't clear on.)  This turned into quite an elaborate sequence, and a good time was being had by all until we noticed that one of the participants had essentially frozen up.<br/><br/>Safety being a priority, we leave lots of time for unpacking, and during that she revealed that the whole theme of Halloween was mystifying and frankly quite frightening to her.  In her culture, pumpkins were a sign of poverty and near-starvation (being a crop of last resort, apparently), and, having been around her fair share of lethal levels of poverty, the whole pumpkins &amp; skeletons thing was some deeply upsetting shit.  Mind blown.<br/><br/>So, of course this is a completely different kind of role-playing than, say, D&amp;D (I suspect she wouldn't enjoy dungeon crawling very much!), but it becomes relevant once you start looking at role-playing that's pursuing emotional risk for its own sake.<br/><br/>The example of chess is useful, JDCorley - people can get riled up about anything, of course, so I'll draw a distinction between chess-like games and emotional-exploration games.  For example, games that are structured to try to evoke in the players emotions about their real lives (rather than the game), particularly about situations they haven't fully resolved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388853/#Comment_388853" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T13:46:30+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  1:46PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Like, say, bullying.

I like to start with a check-in, to find out what's going on in people's lives that they're bringing to the table (what they're willing to share, at any rate!), with the goal of helping everyone understand what's at play, socially.  Helping people get it off their chest and set it aside, and if they can't, letting the group know that it will be affecting them and the play that results - and if they're grouchy, it's because they're suffering insomnia and depression, or just got laid off, or just ended a brief relationship with one of the other players.<br/><br/>2. I like to follow up with intent - what does each of want out of this session?  Especially if emotional risk is involved, it's important to know the agendas.  If we're going to pursue the theme of incest to see if we can gross ourselves out, fine.  Am I trying to work something out because I'm mad at my boss and just want to go on a tear?  Am I hoping someone at the table will have some sort of epiphany?  Do I mostly want to observe to see if I might work up more courage next time?  Am I hoping for a vicarious epiphany from someone else? (wink)<br/><br/>Those are for pretty much any kind of game - both of these I use in a Skype Burning Wheel game, for example, although because it's low risk the session intents tend to be pretty mundane.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388858/#Comment_388858" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T14:10:34+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  2:10PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2012 2:15PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>So Hans; now we come into another territory; what do you say before a game is commenced?

That's not hard.</blockquote>Not at all. I tend to tell muu-players they may be required to sing. Still; for most it is a surprise that I really mean it. ;-)<br/><br/>In my circles it is fairly normal to tell people what theme a game has. That tells the players the general ballpark of the game. If we say it will be a serious game on oppression of indigenous people, and you will play them ...<br/>- then there are no surprise that our characters will be treated badly, and that we will be expected to react to that, immerse in the situation, and play along in a potential tragedy.<br/><br/>We do not go into details of what will happen, beforehand, or how we will do it. We walk together into the "landscape" of this theme, and explore it in various ways, and none of us can predict fully what we will find. The drama that unfolds is a surprise to all of us, when at its best. That is the beauty of role-playing games.<br/><br/>To me safety is all about how we, as humans sharing an experience, treat each other. How we take heed, take a break and take care. When going into a game, serious or not, we have a responsibility to look out for each other. To me that is normal human behavior, and has nothing to do with gaming as such. It is always implied in shared activity (football, tango, boardgames, croquet, hide-and-seek in the woods, etc). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388912/#Comment_388912" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T06:30:50+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  6:30AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for the discussion!

Our fear of death is a very serious subject, yet, even if it present in a hell of a lot of game it seldom approched in a "serious" manner.<br/><br/>If it is the approched the game that make it serious, then you will find serious themes in whatever game you play.

Powerful, meaningful, worthwhile, and generally a good thing, but definitely dangerous.<br/><br/>Wasn't there a line of dialogue a while back about "I will not abandon you." If I remember well, this was in an effort to encourage players to make themselves vulnerable while minimizing some of the danger. There was also the line of dialogue about lines and veils. These were an effort to take those subject that are too dangerous for participants completely off the table. <br/><br/>I don't remember the subtleties of these conversations, but to me the take home message was that you should approach each game with openness and sensitivity, both before the game in the form of full disclosure, as well as during the game with willingness to respond sensitively when previously unknown lines are crossed.<br/><br/>Thomas, it is still not clear to me that your experience and approach is in line with either of these ideas. What exactly was the player you describe told about his responsibilities in the game prior to engaging in it? What were his objections to singing when it came to it? In what way was it better to just quit the game than to simply role play with description as opposed to engaging in LARP? In what ways did you address the extreme power differential between you and the player to alleviate coercion?<br/><br/>From my multiple conversations with you Thomas, your gaming style seems to be one of the mastermind. You come up with the scenario, with huge ambition, strong themes, and serious content, with a definite objective and lesson in mind before play starts. You also seem to like the revelation and surprise inherent in your games. This probably makes for some pretty amazing games with the right groups. The danger, emotionally, in your games is pretty high, and the payoffs are big.<br/><br/>Through my conversation with you, you have never made me feel like you engage with my input into the conversation, and have a tendency to sound offended at my objections to your dismissal of my input. Your anecdotes have never outlined when you made a mistake and learned a lesson, changing your approach. This makes me wary about your games due to the fact that, in some circumstances, sensitivity is necessary during these dangerous gaming sessions. I am afraid that I do not have enough trust for you to engage in a game that you game master that would include anything like me making myself vulnerable. I am not overly sensitive. There are many extremely egotistical firefighters and surgeons who have tried to intimidate and humiliate me while supervising me in very vulnerable positions. They failed, because I am not over-sensitive.<br/><br/>Dangerous and serious gaming requires making yourself vulnerable, and I would want to be made to feel like you would make me safe before I would engage in a "serious" game with you. You have never demonstrated the ability to make me feel safe if I should need it. Sorry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388981/#Comment_388981" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T22:27:35+00:00" title="August 31, 2012 10:27PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2012 10:29PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being <i>open</i> is at the heart of serious gaming, for me. Role-playing is like jazz; you have to listen to your co-players, and play what is on the table, to tune in on the pulse of the game.<br/><br/>As for "I will not abandon you"; that should be a very strong principle in any gaming, or any interaction.<br/><br/>Putting <i>dangerous</i> up there with <i>serious</i>, as if they were an inseparable pair, is too extreme for me. I've done a lot of serious gaming, both fantasy and contemporary, bot with a GM and without, and I have really not experienced much danger in it. To me it seems like some of you are overly focused on a danger that is more perceived than real. Possibly that leaves you less open, and more vulnerable. I do not know.<br/><br/>I have seen players find lots of joy, though, in exploring serious themes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joy</span> is the dominant emotional content in serious gaming, to me. And to those players I have had the fortune of playing with.<br/><br/>Nameless; I can not help you with your doubts. You perception of me is based on a handful of web-debates, no face-to-face meetings. And so is your perception of my gaming. I myself am vary of passing judgement over people I have never met. I think you should ask yourself why you have to pass judgement over me; is it to make my opinions less relevant?<br/><br/>To me a choir of agreement is far more frightening than the one voice standing out. The choir has infinitively more power to hurt someone, and is more likely to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388985/#Comment_388985" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T23:58:53+00:00" title="August 31, 2012 11:58PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a game where someone got REALLY upset because of how their character was acting as played by other people, because they didn't feel like they could stop the game and explain.<br/><br/>It's a real thing, I've seen it first hand.

The vulnerability DO mean that there is some risk and perception of danger involved.  You only feel vulnerable when there is some type of perceived danger involved.<br/><br/>But that danger don't have to be a severe danger. It might be the danger of "being embarrassed" or the danger of "perhaps my friends wont think what I do is good enough". Hence, just a small social risk, that won't do any real damage to the person. Being embarrassed for a few minutes don't scar you mentally forever.<br/><br/>Then there is more of a midlevel risk. The risk of being in real emotional pain for a while. I could use an example from Just A Little Lovin' 2012. One of the players had been to a lot of funerals the last year, and the first funeral scene during the game became a bit to much to her. We where all crying during the funeral scene, but for her it became so intense she needed to take a brake afterwards. It touched on to much real pain. But after the brake she went on and was very happy with the Larp experince.<br/>Is this a "real" danger? Being in real emotional pain for a while is real, yet she herself had opted in to take this risk, and she knew the funeral scene might be hard for her. She was well informed about the game, and had given informed concent to be a part of it. <br/>And while the pain was real it was a passing thing. It didn't do any permanent damage, but it hurt.<br/><br/>Then there is the question of is there serious real risk of real dangers when you play roleplayng games?  Of course you can be hurt in real way during roleplaying games. You can be that during any social event. But I don't think it all that common. People have been hurt and emotionally scarred in all sort of situations. But I don't think playing a roleplaying game with serious themes is a high risk activity. There is a risk there, but there is a risk in all social interactions.<br/><br/>But there are things I would not spring on my players without their informed consent. I would not like to knowingly put then in a situation where they would be in real intense emotional pain (like the girl at the funeral scene) without their informed consent.<br/><br/>Real emotional pain can be a risk and a danger or putting someone in when roleplaying games. I think this is acceptable, but that it should be something you only knowingly do if people give their informed consent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_388991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388991/#Comment_388991" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-01T04:14:34+00:00" title="September  1, 2012  4:14AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a very thoughtful and good post, Elin!
