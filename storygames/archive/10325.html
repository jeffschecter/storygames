I've seen this structure work well in movies and literature, but I've not seen it done much at all in role playing.  Can anyone send me some links to games structured this way or share thoughts on how to do it.  I'm at the brainstorming stage and would love as much input as I can get.<br/><br/>Here's the basic gist of what I want to do.  We'll use a movie of which I am intimately familiar: Starship Troopers to illustrate my point.<br/><br/>The opening scene of Starship Troopers takes place on Klendatu, the aliens' homeworld.  Protagonist of the film Johnny Rico and squad encounter aliens and get basically wiped out.  The last shot is Johnny staring into the camera screaming in pain as bugs surround him.  Fade out.<br/><br/>Fade into Johnny in high school trying clumsily to flirt with his girlfriend.  We're treated to about 30 minutes of Johnny going through basic and the start of the bug war until the scene returns to Klendatu and we see that he is rescued and lives on.<br/><br/>Then the movie goes on to show Johnny become a big hero and lead his own squad, get a promotion, etc.<br/><br/>So to summarize:<br/>1.  There's a bang to get everyone's attention<br/>2.  The details about the past are filled in<br/>3.  The story is finished<br/><br/>Now, as I understand it, The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries is told through flashback with the outcome largely known (the expedition was a success).  The goal in the game is to earn as much honor for your individual character through role playing as possible.<br/><br/>That's not quite what I want.  Basically, I see the characters at a point where they are about to face the biggest challenge of their life and if the succeed, their dreams will come true.  So, in all honesty, the big bang at the beginning doesn't need to be there.  The game could basically be "Tomorrow, you're going to have a shot at your dreams and then camera dissolves to how you all got started" with scenes going around the table until the group gets to the present.<br/><br/>I am not sure how clear that is, but if anyone has any thoughts, that would be great!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229548/#Comment_229548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T07:09:31+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  7:09AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3:16 perhaps not surprisingly has flashbacks that somewhat mimic this (also reminds me of the Infospectre's commentaries or what not) <br/><br/>That said, I would chalk this up to a bait and switch (the bang and then the build up , as apposed to what actually happens in the starship troopers movie) that doesn't work well. If bangs work, they work because they require action, cutting away from that is tedious. If bangs don't work your still building excitement for something (its bugstomping time!) and then running away from it like a mad grue towards the darkness.<br/><br/>Not everything that works in other forms work in games...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229558/#Comment_229558" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T07:42:25+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  7:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrmm...<br/><br/>Would you feel differently if we got rid of the opening action scene?<br/><br/>If the game was more about retelling how the PCs got to where they were now before going and having an end game where they got their big chance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229565/#Comment_229565" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T08:03:36+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  8:03AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alexander Cherry's game <b>Snowball</b>, published in the <a href="http://www.nopress.net" rel="nofollow">Nopress RPG Anthology</a> is designed for this sort of out of sequence storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229634/#Comment_229634" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T11:32:24+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 11:32AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 11:33AM by ccreitz.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been playing Fiasco this way: do a flashforward into a violent (post-Tilt in story order) confrontation, in a scene sometime before the Tilt (in game play order), setting up a Date With Destiny that has to be kept sometime in the next dozen or so scenes.
