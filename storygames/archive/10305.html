I had them make agents, and we came up with Agent Sexton (Dan), Agent Shields (Steve), and Agent Trotter (Isaac), all middle-aged men ready for their first mission.  Without giving anyone a clear idea of what they were doing or why they were doing it, I ran them through insertion so they could get right down to hunting Hostile Personality Harry McCarthy - they had a picture but not much else. They didn't know why they were hunting him, and were only told that they were doing a good thing.  I didn't give up any of the backstory.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter calling control for clothes, the three left the hotel they were in to find a way to hunt down the HP.  They learned quickly that introducing themselves by name generated static (one of the five conditions I made for the mission), and so did asking Personalities about the HP, so they began engaging in a lot more subterfuge at that point - lying about their names, asking indirect, strange questions of the Personalities, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nA guy they met leaving the hotel (Ian Dewey, appeared when static hit three) made them nervous, and they had to pursue him on foot because he took the only cab in the area.  Along the way to the Mall, the agents found a newspaper that they could not read, so they asked a passerby to read it for them.  By this point, I realized I need to be asking for rolls to push up the static, so Instinct rolls to convince the lady to read the newspaper came into play.  Even with 4 in stats, this meant failure for some players, and static started to rise.  So did heart rates.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe newspaper clue led them after Ian Dewey again, and they ran after his cab and forced it to stop - again, heart rates rising due to first-off failures, along with static.  This pushed Agent Sexton into his target rate, which let him roll any number of dice.  We interpreted this to mean that he did not have to roll ALL of his dice in a stat if he figured he could make it just by rolling one, and ran with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, static hit ten and the streets started to flood, so they made some Force rolls to get away from the flood.  The agents ran into the helpful lady who read them newspapers while taking shelter - here, Agent Sexton used Access to get a series of planks on the rooftops to run to get to the Mall, while the other agents used Force to simply leap from roof to roof.  Agent Shields fell twice, losing stats along the way - with good Force and Athletics, he was sure he could make it, which is why he cut it so close and rolled two failures before he leapt to the rooftop and started catching up with Trotter.  This was when they realized they could pull off superhuman stunts in the City.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, rising static had Control calling INTO Blue City, instructing any agent who picked up to keep tabs on his fellow agents or giving other contradictory, vague instructions.  The operators on the other end changed and hints were dropped that the player's team had been contacted in error - that there might be another team in the area.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the Mall, all agents were above their target heart rates or at their maximums, and static was also near twenty.  The hostile personality emerged, but so did another team of agents.  While Sexton and Trotter tried to take down the HP (Trotter had a cool scene where he used Force to punch a table the HP threw at him in two), Shields stood outside and grappled with an apparent Mystery Agent - perhaps the second team.  When Shields took his enemy's gun, the disarmed Mystery Agent ran away into an alley and screamed into silence - static being so high that the Spidermen were emerging.  The rest of the second Mystery Agent team tried to prevent Trotter from applying the Lacuna Device, so he tore away their guns and shot them both down. Trotter then applied the device and the agents frantically ejected - with Shields firing on the Spidermen to chase them away.  The girl appeared and placed a hand on Shields' arm - he was delayed because the phone right next to her rang, and he answered it only to hear Control warn frantically for him to not let the girl touch him - but he ejected moments later.  Control denied sending in another team and commended the agents for a job well done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy this point, Sexton was almost dead due to losing Force and Instinct, and almost died because he failed his initial Access roll to eject.  Shields was hurt from his earlier flight across the cityscape, but suffered no additional injury.  Trotter got out unscathed.  Static was 28 and everyone was above maximum heart rate.  This seems counter to other Actual Plays I've read in which either static or BPM doesn't shoot up during the game, leaving the two tracks a bit imbalanced.  I was worried for awhile that BPM would cap while static would stay under 10, but I guess I could've let them find the HP prior to static hitting 18 if that occurred. . . <br/>\n<br/>\nWe weren't sure exactly how to work Commendation - since the mission was a success, it seems they keep it going into the next mission.  Also, I noticed that the game moves very fast - if I hadn't added a bit of a scene midway through, we probably could have done two missions in an evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere was my static chart:<br/>\n<br/>\n0 Insertion<br/>\n3 Contact with Ian Dewey<br/>\n5 Control becomes hostile<br/>\n10 Blue City floods<br/>\n15 Ian Dewey runs from team<br/>\n18 Contact with Hostile Personality<br/>\n20 Control deploys hostile team<br/>\n21 Spidermen emerge<br/>\n25 The Girl appears<br/>\n<br/>\nStatic for:  Apprehending Ian, Failure to let Ian take the cab, Telling Personalities your name, Talking to Personalities about the HP, and Letting Ian die.<br/>\n<br/>\n- - - - <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we dug it and plan to do another insertion next Monday.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229137/#Comment_229137" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T23:42:14+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 11:42PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 11:44PM by whiteknife.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a fun game. I'm wrapping up a very awesome campaign in a couple of weeks. <br/><br/>Yeah, the game runs fast- I usually just go with it and play out two missions.<br/><br/>As for static and heart rate rising, I find that one can exceed the other if a mission is heavy on action (heartrate jumps up) or intrigue (static goes up), but if you have a ix of both or some more aggressive static conditions you can bring them both up without much effort. <br/><br/>Looks like you had some cool static stuff going on though, I'll have to take a note of that telling personalities your name thing.<br/><br/>Oh, and how I ran commendations was that you could either spend them during the mission to get the temporary benefit or save them for the end which "banked" them, meaning they counted on your sheet towards extra techniques and promotion but weren't usable in missions any more. I'm not sure if that's the way the book says to go (and I did some crazy houseruling with adding different colors of commendations and all sorts of stuff) so whichever way you think is best is the way to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229194/#Comment_229194" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T08:47:13+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  8:47AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your interpretation of commendations seems to be how the rules work.

That way, I won't run into the problem of them never disclosing their names just because their first mission made it so. :)  Also, I liked how the static generated by the more-or-less random Personality Ian Dewey made him into a prime target for the team.

Without saying anything spoilerish, how do you handle it?</blockquote>\nOK, well first of all the way I primarily handle hostile personalities is by not tying them to a specific number of static, but jsut having it when I feel is appropriate and the static has been raised (actually, I do all static events this way, doing one per static point, which makes stuff really weird, but that's how I like it). <br/><br/>Handling the girl is completely up to you. The thing with Lacuna is there is no universal truth about the setting except what you as the GM decide upon. Personally I usually put the girl in at the very end of a mission when static is really high. I tend to have her standing around while some totally bizarre event goes on (like the sun appearing and then turning into a black hole that begins to erase reality). <br/><br/>Finally, changing the static conditions is good- alternatively, you can do what I've done since after the first adventure and record static secretly, not letting anyone know when it goes up or why. Hell, I've gone through ten full length missions and my players haven't figured out <i>any</i> of the static conditions. I just nudge a dice to indicate higher static so it's unnoticeable to them but I can read it at a glance (making marks on a paper tends to get conspicuous after a while). Of course I still describe the static as the characters hear/feel it, but it's not in exact terms...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229398/#Comment_229398" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:45:22+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read an AP report in which static was recorded by tossing those little gems into a glass mug.
