In response, government and corporate powers pool resources and send out brave teams of heroes to discover what went wrong and reconnect survivors and planets to the intergalactic network. Along the way, they'll encounter hordes of mutant colonists, space vampires, ill-tempered robots, sinister AIs, and other terrors beyond your wildest imagination.<br/><br/>But deeper than that, the heroes, corporate powers, shadowy interests, and government forces all have their own agendas. Every mission poses challenges to the heroes - do they follow their own agenda or someone else's? Do they pull back the curtain on humanity's cruelty or take a fat paycheck? Do they tell the truth or take care of themselves?<br/><br/>This is a game that is intended to replicate (in some ways) great (and awful) science fiction movies or games like Screamers, Alien, Total Recall (Arnold version), Mass Effect, Half Life 2, Halo, and so on.<br/><br/><b>What does it play like?</b><br/>It's fun and fast. The core game mechanic is a pile of D6s, where evens count as successes. Each scene or horde of vile creatures has a difficulty number which must be reduced to 0 to "win". Some scenes may have multiple difficulty numbers. And some of those may have deadlines, basically a finite number of turns to pull it off before you fail. Meanwhile, heroes can use their motivation in play to gain bonus dice, rely on extra dice from a shared equipment pool, or work together to accomplish their mission goals.<br/><br/>An example:<br/><i>An RX team has infiltrated a command center hq. The hacker sits down to the mainframe, desperately trying to dump the data logs to his computer device. Meanwhile, a horde of enraged radiated man-spiders are ripping through the hq walls to get at the heroes. The horde has an SD of 14 - the hacker has an SD of 6 to get the info he wants. The power to the mainframe will run out in 3 turns, so he doesn't have much time. While the hacker tries to get his data, the others will be trying to hold off the man-spiders as they sling green venom and steel webbing at the team.</i><br/><br/>Heroes do advance and grow in ability through nano robotic technology and self help services in space, but that all costs credits. They gain credits by completing mission goals offered by the Interplanetary Union or side goals offered through under the table contracts from corporations and shadowy organizations. And often, these goals clash. The IU may tell the heroes to protect a certain scientist, while a shadowy organization might pay double to assassinate him. Meanwhile, if the heroes follow their own motivation, they don't get cash but do get bonus dice to use time and time again. It will always be a challenge for the players to decide how to survive and who to follow.<br/><br/>The game has a fairly traditional GM/player relationship setup, though lots of the setting is fuzzy. Players and the GM get to decide what caused the Great Blackout. The GM's most important job is probably crafting mission goals that clash and force players into difficult decisions. The players can seek to accomplish their missions in a bunch of different ways, skipping ahead to the action.<br/><br/>There are lots of other cool bits to the game too. You can get a glimpse on the <a href="http://www.mysticages.com/games/fe" rel="nofollow">website</a>, but I'd love to answer questions about gameplay or tell you more about the process. The art was done by Dede Putra and Sean Thurlow. Brent Jans edited the book. I did the layout myself. You can see a PDF preview here: <a href="http://mysticages.com/resources/ForeignElementPreview.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://mysticages.com/resources/ForeignElementPreview.pdf</a><br/><br/>By the way, I actually started this game around the time that my first RPG, Eldritch Ass Kicking, came out. In between, I got married, had kids, graduated with a masters degree, and moved twice. Life is nuts. I'd encourage anyone who is writing to not be afraid to keep at it, even when life gets in the way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NathanHill" title="NathanHill"><img alt="NathanHill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/917/nAZLTLHXP58YO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NathanHill">NathanHill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424882/#Comment_424882" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-27T21:30:36+00:00" title="November 27, 2013  9:30PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2013 9:30PM by NathanHill.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick update - I've got Foreign Element setup through Lulu, so if you prefer printed books, this one looks pretty gorgeous. It's the first time I have used Lulu myself, and I'm happy with the quality.
