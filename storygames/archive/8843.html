Her team's going to the area tournament today, undefeated in the season.  <br/><br/>The season's like 7 games, but they're undefeated in those 7 (by 20-50 point margins in each game).  I don't know any of these kids, I've never met a single one of them.  My Mom is glad they're showing sportsmanship, and obviously she'd like it if they win, but she's more interested in how the kids feel than anything else.  Now, if they win or lose has no impact on me, either way.<br/><br/>But, man, do I want them to win.  SO BAD.  I'm sitting here thinking about it all day when I should be working.<br/><br/>Strangely, I've noticed this effect when I'm GMing, and players have decided they really like a given NPC.  Like, if the little-kid NPC from the PC's hometown is in a race, even if I'm just narrating the whole race, no illusion of dice, I'll always have the players rapt.  <br/><br/>There's a funny thing about how easy it is to get invested in "our team."<br/><br/>Edit: In general, I hate basketball.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195594/#Comment_195594" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T07:16:09+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  7:16AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah! Every so often, something just hits them "right". I recently introduced a NPC into our ongoing game by saying "When you answer the phone, you hear him scream "VLAD IS VERY UPSET!!"" and immediately everyone said "we love Vlad". If I could bottle it and spread it around onto other areas of the game where they're eye-rolling or could care less, I would!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195754/#Comment_195754" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T20:40:46+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  8:40PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The secret is identification, I think.  Someone mirrors a player's feelings on an issue or does something the players would like to do and they imprint on the player (not the PC per se) and you can kind of feel it when it happened.  And then you feed that spark to make a fire.<br/><br/>I had an NPC in a game once that was just a street urchin who was supposed to come up and offer to guide the PC group around town (they were a ship crew and new to town).  He had some tidbits to share, so I had him make conversation while they considered his offer.  His tidbit of info was that the city had a "guild" of urchins that was run by this evil "Fagan" guy who the kids hated.  The kid shared some opinions about other thing going on and his opinion of the Wizard's Guild mirrored their own and he expressed his contempt so well the group hired him on as guide and started working on a plan to get him out from under his master.<br/><br/>By the end, they were doing all sorts of things to help this kid (and even helped him set up a nice business that they heaped planning into as only PC groups can).  It was a very cool aside that added extra flavor to the "real" reason the group was on the island and made things that much better for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
