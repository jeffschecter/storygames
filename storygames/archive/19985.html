The games that we play are just whatever filth and detritus happened to be there when we were spit on the floor, while we we still sticky and pliable. Some of us were dropped on the floor of hobby shops after Friday Night Magic and Saturday afternoon <i>Pathfinder</i> was in full swing before someone found us, scraped us up, and drop us in the trash on top of a stack of unsold copies of some third tier X-Man's solo series. Others were dropped on the sidewalk between a used clothing store and an independent theatre showing <i>The Brother from Another Planet</i> and ended up stuck to the sole of a pair of vintage combat boots. I was wadded up inside a newspaper article on the Boston Marathon Bombing and dropped inside a used needle return. <br/><br/>Regardless of where we came from, now most of us are hardened and calcified and nothing new will stick to us, so the only thing left for us to do is to try to make sense of the garbage that is already there. Surely it's there for a reason, right? Our tastes have to be cohesive; they have to point towards meaningful categories or taxonomies, or else shit would just be random, and we would just be sad and gross.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442001/#Comment_442001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T18:49:49+00:00" title="January 25, 2015  6:49PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://thmg.photobucket.com/albums/v654/Stephisto47/Funny%20Pictures/th_iagree.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442004/#Comment_442004" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T19:36:29+00:00" title="January 25, 2015  7:36PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The implicit question, though: what about the pieces of gum that were used for, I don't know, art installations or jewelry? Even if we subscribe to a model of acculturation where human development stultifies early and geeks continue obsessing over their childhood nostalgia forevermore, that doesn't mean that everybody's damage is equal and equally meaningless. We could posit a gamer who was intentionally or accidentally exposed even-handedly to varied, noble and significant influences, causing them to calcify into a pleasing and useful form.<br/><br/>Of course each gamer (or human in general - surely gaming's no different from any other cultural influences) would be personally unable to judge who's a jewel and who's just a gross mastication product, but as long as we're presupposing that used gum is gross (to some outside observer, presumably), we're clearly also capable of assuming that non-gross things may potentially exist. Thus, some might be more equal in their sad grossness than others, even if we know not which ones.<br/><br/>I appreciate the humility inherent to the metaphor, though, and agree with the idea that early influences do much to shape aesthetic language - what humans find compelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442005/#Comment_442005" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T20:01:49+00:00" title="January 25, 2015  8:01PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2015 8:02PM by whduryea.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I love you, dude.<br/><br/>Seriously though, everything you said is valid, and I don't disagree with anything.<br/><br/>Although in order for the metaphor to accommodate art installations and jewelry, you would have to be living in a universe with intelligent design, in which case you'd have an outside power to imbue the gum with beauty and meaning.<br/><br/>Totally with you on the fact that gaming is no different from other "cultural influences." Wasn't my intention to say that gamers were "sad and gross" when compared to, say, athletes or film buffs.

It's inhibiting my ability to stick to Burning Wheel.  While I wait, I'm going to go re-read Amazing Spider-Man # 250.  Oh, if only Comics For Collectors had been more responsible in their sculpting of my gooey self than to put the TSR and Marvel books on the same shelf.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I found most of my current favorite games after 2008, and I'm still looking forward to trying the freeform LARPy stuff I've never done but expect to love, so... I think someone's still chewin' me, at least occasionally.  Also, I kind of <i>like</i> the fact that my tastes defy easy sorting into meaningful categories or taxonomies.<br/><br/>Maybe we're, like, <i>recently</i> chewed gum.  It no longer just sticks to everything, but it can still stick to some things if ground against them hard enough or long enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442019/#Comment_442019" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T02:45:21+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  2:45AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2015 2:48AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clear enough.<br/><br/>We may have lost all our Flavour and Colour, but with enough chewing by a willing chewer (presumably someone with an obsessive chewing habit, no access to fresh gum, low standards when it comes to taste, and the willingness not to worry about germs or to wonder <i>where we've been</i>) we can regain some suppleness.<br/><br/>Go and find the jaws of your dreams. Presumably your target audience is someone who a) spent many years (their childhood?) chewing a great deal of gum, but b) no longer has access to any. As marketing advice, this sounds fairly spot-on.<br/><br/>I once sat on a piece of gum (while wearing a very nice shirt, no less) on a public bus. I've tried everything, and never been able to entirely remove that thing from the fabric. (Freezing it was fairly effective, but even that didn't ultimately do the job).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442037/#Comment_442037" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T14:48:51+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  2:48PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I... can't find a way to stretch this metaphor to include people like me, who have played more new games recently than in the 20 years before.
