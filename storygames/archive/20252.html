This has been fun and rewarding, particularly as we're creating and exploring a world that has a realness and a tangibleness about it, and it makes it much easier to schedule sessions than a traditional fixed-group model. <br/><br/>I'm finding though, that I miss my home territory - Burning Wheel -style character-goal-centric play. The West Marches game tends towards murderhoboing, partly because most of my NPCs are hostile, and partly because we've been using the 5e system, which has few rules for social or community action - it's all built around combat-heavy action-adventure. An extreme contrast to BW.<br/><br/>I also want to try more troupe play (multiple PCs per player), which I've had some success with in a previous game I ran. And I want to  make the PCs major players in a community (e.g. a town) which provides a uniting factor and something to fight for (in a world that's otherwise quite hostile).<br/><br/>So meta-concept --- <i>"An open table game that's about my kind of player-driven character stories that intertwine and often pit PCs against each other (or at least at cross purposes) (with full knowledge by the players of all the PC's different agendas). Action focuses on a town-like community in which the PCs are significant players."</i><br/><br/>My main concern is that BW-style games hinge on players being to intervene when another player threatens their interests. This could be by a direct attack on your assets, or by something that makes your goals irrelevant. E.g. I might burn down your manor as a favour to get a your NPC nemesis off my back, or I might  go off to attack your nemesis because she's threatening my brother. Ideally, you'd want to be able to take action in either case - but you can't if you're not playing that session.<br/><br/>(Troupe play is likely to compound this, at it increase the number of PCs and (presumably) the number of "claims" they'll have on NPCs and game-world assets.)<br/><br/>I'm not aware of any tabletop RPG that has done anything like this, not with an open table, so I don't know of any examples of solutions. I suspect that there are useful practices in e.g. Vampire LARP but I've no experience of that.<br/><br/>My main current ideas for resolving this issue:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> <i>(Simplest approach)</i> Encourage players to rationalise PC behaviour constrained by the two above bullets - make it an explicit part of their principles and agenda.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Have some metagame "stability assumptions" e.g. "the town will endure, it will not be destroyed or rendered utterly different in a radical (i.e. in one-or-two sessions) way, although it could change significantly over time i.e over 4 or more sessions"<br/><br/><b>3)</b> <i>(More heavy-handed)</i> Have some metagame rules to protect the PCs of absent players e.g. "you can't attack a primary PC, or their assets, unless the player is present". (Could lead to weird boxing-like dynamics where two people should obviously fight/talk/work together but never do because they just never seem to arrange it, but hey, that could actually be fun, and make it more of an event when they do). <br/><br/><b>4)</b> <i>(Even more heavy-handed)</i> You can tag entities you don't "own" as yours e.g. your nemesis, your lost love, your difficult child. No-one else can make permanent change to them in a session you're not playing in.<br/><br/><b>5)</b> <i>(A workaround for some problems with the heavy options)</i> Could have a way to issue a out-of-character challenge to another player regarding a PC of theirs (e.g. "I intend to persuade you to approve an expediton beyond the wall") and if they can't arrange to meet you in play within e.g. a real-world month, then you get to act against them with the GM running them as an NPC.<br/><br/><br/>Any thoughts? Any advice? Any games or advice I should definitely read?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446142/#Comment_446142" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T10:34:16+00:00" title="July 11, 2015 10:34AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I have some metarules that give absent players a bunch of protection in this regard.

(For many reasons which you list in your post.) So it's definitely a significant challenge.<br/><br/>If I were going to do this, I would prefer your Option 3. It seems like the cleanest and easiest solution (although could be frustrating sometimes, particularly if you have a time-sensitive plan and another player is suddenly absent for two weeks).<br/><br/>Adding some more mechanical support on top of the rules currently in play could really help, as well. I like Sandra's solution (safety is balanced with a loss of experience), for instance.<br/><br/>Another way would be to include some kind of metagame resource that players could use to indicate how much they care about certain challenges.<br/><br/>Just off the top of my head: you receive 10 points per session, and you carry forward half of whatever you had at the end of the previous session. When another player challenges you, but you know you won't be able to make the session, you can spend some of those points:<br/><br/>10 points (or maybe more, like 12, so it's not sustainable) allows you to delay the confrontation until the next session.<br/><br/>Spending fewer than 10 points gives you some kind of advantage in that session. The GM plays you as an NPC, but the number of points indicates how actively she will do so:<br/><br/>Perhaps 0 points means you act as a regular NPC (susceptible to Intimidation, Diplomacy rolls, or whatever other mechanics you have in place for PCs to push around NPCs). If the other players set a trap for your character, he'll probably at most get an Intelligence check to avoid it, or whatever a typical monster would get.<br/><br/>More points means your character has more agency in your absence, and gives a bonus to rolls in conflict or allow for preparation. (If you use that same Intelligence check to avoid traps, for instance, each point spent gives your PC a +1 on that roll in your absence.)<br/><br/>So, if you spend points on your PC's position, the other players are at a disadvantage to influence them or fight them or trap them or whatever. They're better off waiting for you to come back, but if they really need to push ahead, they can - it will just be very difficult.<br/><br/>Another thought:<br/><br/>Perhaps players could bribe each other with some kind of resource, as well or instead of this.<br/><br/>I basically say, "Hey, how about while you're away your character meets with mine, and I convince him to lend me 100 soldiers for the coming battle?" And then I and the GM make you an offer: "If you agree, you get 500 XPs." Or some other currency.<br/><br/>Or you can both bid some points or currency, and the winner gets their way. (Perhaps you roll dice and add +1 for each point spent, once again.)<br/><br/>The idea is to make the negotiation and confrontation "fair", so that you can win conflicts with other players in their absence, but only with their consent (because they've agreed to a bidding contest or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446159/#Comment_446159" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T21:55:29+00:00" title="July 11, 2015  9:55PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This question is relevant to my interests because I've been kicking around an idea of running an ongoing West-Marches-ish Burning Wheel sandbox campaign world, where many players can interact with the same setting.<br/><br/>One parallel idea I've had is to run West Marches Mouse Guard. This neatly solves many of the issues: as guard mice, the players have a certain degree of common interest; it explains the ad hoc parties (you're going out with this patrol because that's who was available when the orders came down); the players don't expect perfect control of where they are, since they sometimes have to run around putting out metaphorical fires (Gwendolen needs you at the scent border! There's a moose over there!); you have an excuse for why you can't interact with non-present PCs (they're out on patrol); and so on.<br/><br/>The resources around the player-characters are a little tricker to manage (which is why the original West Marches banned adventures in the town). I think you'd have to develop some guidelines about what is and is not allowed to change, and how fast. The geographic separation in the setting helps, I think. And you'd probably want a guideline that even if something gets disrupted (e.g. the town burns down) the relationship characters survive, albeit as refugees (more adventures!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446164/#Comment_446164" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T00:15:31+00:00" title="July 12, 2015 12:15AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, I have some metarules that give absent players a bunch of protection in this regard.

Not the basic game - I like that - but characters of all different levels adventuring together, especially in a game that's pretty damn brutal like OD&amp;D is. You can certainly play that way and have a fun game, but, in my experience, it's unnecessarily tricky to make the game appeal to everyone across multiple power levels and often gives an annoying job to higher level players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446173/#Comment_446173" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T03:32:59+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  3:32AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5E's pretty much fine with it.

(For example this <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?3246-BW-One-on-One-Part-1-Master-Si-Juk" rel="nofollow">series of actual play threads</a>) Not precisely the same thing as concurrent antagonistic adventures, but might be a useful thing to research.<br/><br/>More on-topic, explicitly PC vs PC is tricky. For not-physically-present players, the only way I have recent personal experience with it is a Callisto game, where I think my design solution works but it needs more playtesting. Have you considered introducing an out-of-session level to the game? A message board or wiki or something, where the various characters and their agendas can be laid out for everyone to see? <br/><br/>It doesn't even have to be that interactive; especially since the big changes should probably happen during at-table play. But it might work as a way to catalog where the world is for the players who aren't present. <br/><br/>You could even have the not-present characters write letters in character about what they see happening with their stuff when they're gone. Again, probably not as a major focus because a) you want at-table play to matter and b) if they can't make the sessions they may not have time to write letters either.<br/><br/>(One of my other campaign ideas is to do Dwarf Fortress Burning Wheel where the players build a community in play.

It will also help that I'll ask players to create characters with moral standards, and with things in the setting that they care about (for my WM game, I explicitly asked people <i>not</i> to do that).<br/><br/>PvP - I want some level of that, at least in the sense that PCs will make things hard for each other. How much... that's to be worked out, and probably negotiated with the players.<br/><br/>The "personal plotlines" idea - do you mean that PCs wouldn't be able to have goals that lasted over a session they missed? That sounds a very blunt tool. I want the game to be, BW-style, mostly <i>about</i> character stories.<br/><br/>(Bear in mind that, as with WM, I <i>intend</i> for players to miss sessions.

Get them into the idea of embracing tragedy, betrayal, and loss as parts of the fiction.<br/><br/><i>Smallworld</i> uses this mentality shift in a war board game. Rather than have one "army" or even faction that you play doggedly to the end, part of the game is allowing your factions to go into decline and using a new one. <br/><br/>You could even add game mechanics for when things that you created (characters, places, whatever) get messed with. Maybe it gives you bonus points for your next character, so that players who suffer a lot of tragedy get to make stronger and stronger characters or more interesting places.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446339/#Comment_446339" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T13:25:38+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  1:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another idea would be to <b>break up the player/character monogamy</b>.

It would be unfair to the players who are present to hobble them because of missing players.<br/><br/>The old school approach would probably be that if you're not there, tough. You PC may be immune from direct action, but otherwise, everything is fair game. People might choose to be kind if the player was missing for some significant reason (illness, family emergency, etc.).<br/><br/>You probably need to leave a lot of this open to the players negotiations as part of the social contract. If you agree to play in this game, and allow for your interests to be mixed with another players, you need to negotiate with that player what is permissible action against your interests when you are not present, with the understanding that players who are present for a session get to play and play is not stopped just because Cordelia's player isn't present.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446426/#Comment_446426" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T07:13:56+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  7:13AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ludo - yes, I will definitely change system. Currently looking at a derivative of The Shadow of Yesterday / Solar System that I've been fiddling with for a while.<br/><br/>Some stability of the core (the town etc) is important, I think, because I want knowledge gained by players to be stable enough over time that they can come back after not playing for several sessions and still feel that they know the immediate setting.<br/><br/>Ludo, BeePeeGee - I've run games before that are fast and loose with characters. I'm wary of doing that for main characters, but secondary ones perhaps. The players I'm targetting find the frequency of PC death in my West Marches game quite wearing.<br/><br/>Ludo's idea about <i>compensating</i> players for losses they weren't there to prevent - that has legs. Very similar to the (usually voluntary) "take a fall, get a power point" mechanics that Fate and Hillfolk use.<br/><br/>(On that note, I've been reading a lot about Ars Magica troupe play, albeit with most of the focus on multiple GMs, which is not what I plan to do here.

The characters are located in a small city; there is also D&amp;D play happening in the same campaign world. There has been little PvP.<br/><br/>Some points:<br/><br/>1. Characters have personal goals, there are things happening in the world more or less independently of their actions, and the characters have goals that are related to other player characters.<br/><br/>2. During any given session, the characters are exposed to what is happening in the world (there are several factions) and the players are free to pursue the personal goals of their characters. They don't pursue goals which are strongly related to characters of absent players; this may have been mentioned once or twice, but is mostly taken for granted.<br/><br/>3. If a player is often present, then the game tends to focus more around their character. If someone is only occasionally present, then issues central to their character tend to be less central and develop only rarely or not very explicitly. We then catch up when the player returns.<br/><br/>4. We review beliefs (and occasionally other ITs) at the beginning of each session and try to focus them around stuff that is of interest to several different present player characters, or at least check that everyone has something they can pursue, given the present players.<br/><br/><br/>With more PvP, if I were to use this as a baseline, I would divide the game into several subject matters of three different levels:<br/>1. Major: Who leads the town? Affects everyone.<br/>2. Minor: Who gets to marry Aino? Affects the suitors, which means a couple of player characters.<br/>3. Personal: Learning a spell. Affects only one character, though others might help or get involved in other ways.<br/><br/>Personal matters are fair play.<br/>Minor matters are fair play when the involved players are present, otherwise they are off limits.<br/>Major matters are the actual problem. Some options.<br/><br/>1. Whoever is playing gets to act. If you are not present often, then you won't be one of the power players in the conflict in question. Adjust your play and goals accordingly.<br/>2. Factions. At least one player character representative of each faction should be present in order for the major conflicts to be the subject of play.<br/>3. Only incremental advances are possible in major conflicts during any given session. Maybe use something similar to Duel of Wits (or <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Burning_Kingdoms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Burning_Kingdoms</a> or <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Battle!" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Battle!</a> ) , with one maneuvre per session per faction or participant. This will stop anyone from simply taking the power during a session when others are absent. Maybe combine this with other options.<br/><br/>Also, a culture of sportsmanship where everyone recognises that these restrictions are to be honoured, not sneakily avoided. I recommend being vocal and explicit about this. This may be easier with agreements and standards of behaviour than with explicit rules, as people might be more likely to min-max and work around rules.

Hence, there is a sandbox world (larger than what is seen in the BW sessions) and I see little point in describing all of that. I do speak pretty openly during the BW session, but not all players are present, not everything is discussed, and so on. I am open about things related to beliefs of characters, of course.<br/>It is not always easy to know what to tell everyone before it becomes relevant.<br/><br/>Also, players miss sessions, so I have very little idea about which players know what. Also, some play in the occasional D&amp;D sessions in the same setting, which gives a different perspective.<br/><br/>So, the matter of hidden and unknown information in my game is complicated.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>We might consider playing a single Battle! at some point in the future, depending on the direction the game takes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447104/#Comment_447104" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T15:36:17+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  3:36PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please let me know how it goes if you do!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447107/#Comment_447107" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T16:02:29+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  4:02PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you implement troupe-style play such that PCs belong to a particular player only while in play, are played by various players over time, and are otherwise NPCs, I think it clears up all the issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447223/#Comment_447223" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-25T09:37:36+00:00" title="July 25, 2015  9:37AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all - I'll mull these over while I'm putting the first version of the game together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
