Now, I had absolutely no idea what "YackPack" is, so I googled around for a bit and what I found sounds quite interesting.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, <a href="http://www.yackpack.com" rel="nofollow">Yackpack</a> seems to be a Web 2.0-Style, voice chat/messaging-based Social Website-thingy where people can open public/private voicechat groups called pack that feature both live chat and saved voice messages for people who are offline. <br/><br/>(Well, and it has tons of the usual Widgets one can put on Websites for stuff like live voice chat or answering machine-style features.)<br/><br/>Now, I only stumbled over it today and I haven't really tried it out yet, but if it works as promised, I could see quite a bunch of usefull gaming applications, especially if combined with my favorite internet technology, the Wiki. But I've been wondering, has anyboy else any experience with YackPack? Good, Bad, Ugly? <br/><br/>Aaron                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77300/#Comment_77300" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T01:52:02+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  1:52AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a bit of playing around and trying to find a way to really test this, I just <a href="http://graveyard.pbwiki.com/YackPackTest" rel="nofollow">added one of those live voice chat Widgets to one of my wikis.</a> So, if anybody wants to try it out, I'll be online the next thirty minutes or so.

Maybe it was me being on Linux or something. (Although the regular Yackpack thing where you just record messages online worked fine on it. I don't get it.)<br/><br/>Bit of a bummer, but, well, whatever. That's what Skype is for, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
