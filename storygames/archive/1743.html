                    That's right, bring down the "My Guy" discussion pain. Drop some info about a recent character or two that you played, or if you primarily GM, describe one of the characters of one of the players and tell us what is interesting about them. I figure it's a fun activity to get to know the other board members. Feel free to post more than one character, and go into as little or as much detail as you want.<br/><br/>Looking for:<br/><br/>Character Name: <br/>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell:<br/>System: <br/>Stuff she's good at:<br/>Stuff she's bad at:<br/>What you like about this character in general:<br/>What you like most about playing this character: (or, if a GM, what you like most about how the player plays that character)<br/>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?:<br/>Anything else:                </div>

                            Character Name:<br/>JAXRIL DAV0S (usually said in a "heavy metal voice" while throwing "the horns")<br/><br/>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell:<br/>Ambassador/Aristocrat and Gene-modded human<br/><br/>System:<br/>Savage Worlds, SF style game<br/><br/>Stuff he's good at:<br/>Diplomacy, Speech, Investigation, Getting into Trouble, Being Aristocratic and Haughty, and Hand-to-Hand Combat<br/><br/>Stuff he's bad at:<br/>Non-ritualized "yucky" combat (he's got hand-to-hand skills but nothing else). Keeping his mouth shut. Keeping his curiosity at bay. Breathing in regular atmosphere without his rebreather.<br/><br/>What you like about this character in general:<br/>The fact that he's a bit alien. This character is set in a kind of "high powered Firefly" style universe, and he's the only outsider in the group. Also, he only has limited combat skills in a combat-heavy game, and yet he feels like he's capable because of all his social skills and resources. But the "just a little left of human" alienness is the most interesting thing, I think. Also has a mysterious background: Doesn't talk about home much, even though he's a noble.<br/><br/>What you like most about playing this character: The alienness is fun to play out. I can make him flaky or steadfast, aggressive or innocent, and just sort of go, "That's the way of his people" to shrug it off.  Also, I like playing the high-power social guys when the system can support it, it's fun being the diplomat, and finding new ways to get the crew into some possible trouble.<br/><br/>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?:<br/>Not really. Maybe one thing; in most games with a structured combat system, I tend to max it out to really enjoy the features of combat and the like. Savage Worlds is all about the combat, and yet I (as a player) am having a blast with this low combat high ephemeral social skills character. It makes me want to try this kind of character out in other systems.<br/><br/>Anything else:<br/>I made this dude from scratch in about four minutes, including all his Gene-Modification fiddly bits. And yet, he's more fun to play than characters in systems that forced me to put 2-3 hours into character generation.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            The one I most recently played:<br/>
<br/>
Character Name: Jet<br/>
Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell: Teenaged speedster hero<br/>
System: Freeform trait system, DC universe<br/>
Stuff he's good at: Wide-eyed exposition prompting. "Holy crap, Supergirl, what the hell IS that thing?" Ninja fighting (everything is in slow motion)<br/>
Stuff he's bad at: Maturity, taking his time with something, planning<br/>
What you like about this character in general: His nemeses are awesome. I've built them up over five years of play...there's the air pirates, and the robot ninjas, and the volcano god, and his supervillainess wannabe ex-girlfriend who fills up his voicemail with long threatening messages...I really feel like I'm contributing to the Flash Rogue's Gallery.<br/>
What you like most about playing this character: The opportunities for humor, and I'm playing with some people who love to be straight men for him.<br/>
Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?: Hmmm....the sheer length of time I've been playing him is highly impressive to me when I think back on it.                        </div>

<br/>
It's hard to say what the appeal is here, other than having the chance to run amok, smash things, insult people, seduce various seduce-able characters &amp; things, outsmart people, and be totally self-interested--knowing all the while that the city can hardly repudiate him, since they have much bigger problems than a self-indulgent superhero.  Although this character *sounds* kind of ridiculous as summarized here, there's some (presently unexplored) moral depth to him too.                        </div>

Stuff he's good at: "Location Magic". Enchanting places. Messing directly with essence.<br/>

What you like about this character in general: How he's human, despite his abstruse field of study<br/>
What you like most about playing this character: Seeing him struggle with conflicts between working on his magic, and dealing with personal relationships.<br/>
Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?: I'm not sure I'm capable of poingant...<br/>

                            Character Name: Carmine Delucci<br>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell: A Made Man<br>System: Freeform-ish LARP<br>Stuff he's good at: Smoking, getting into manly conversations about women and life in general while on guard duty with other members of the family, being nervous and clicking gun's safety on-off-on without noticing it, drinking budweiser.<br>Stuff he's bad at: Playing poker, holding his temper, controlling his vivid imagination, not slapping waitress' ass if an opportunity presents itself, not running into woods chasing shadows.<br>What you like about this character in general: He's a solid, rich character, comes from somewhere, has no goals as such. Just does what he's supposed to do, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding.<br>What you like most about playing this character: Getting that Sopranos-feeling, complete with the budweiser and just the right kind of club sandwhich. The supporting cast of characters and players. Hitting empty beercans with baseball bat, because it's both manly and boyish thing to do. Getting to play poker with no money involved but the game chips suddenly having a very real meaning when you're playing for the house.<br>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?: I think I've broken the safetÃ½ switches of two airsoft guns in last five games. Also, if you smoke two and a half pack of cigarettes on one evening and night, your head hurts in the morning.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Xochipulti, a high priest of a bloody Aztec-pastiche theocracy.  (The system is one I'm bound by an NDA, so I can't really talk about it that much.)<br/><br/>Good at/Bad at:  He's the mysterious foreigner in the group.  Due to his extensive use of blood in magical rituals, nearly all of the hirelings and henchmen that are with us are afraid of him. So there's all that entails. <br/><br/>What you like about this character in general/What you like most about playing this character:  Most of the characters I've played seemed to fall into the comic relief category. Xochipulti is the first character that's so very far away from my standard role.  He also knows that his overall goal is good, in fact out of all the other characters, he believes he's the most Good character, even though he's gotten the most Evil flags.  In D&amp;D terms, he's a very ethical, very moral Lawful Evil character.  (Although if the game was set in Xochipulti's homeland, he'd be seen as Lawful Good.)                        </div>

                            From my group's summer game:<br/><br/><b>Character Name:</b> Detective Benjamin Stark<br/><b>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell:</b> Slightly Jaded Detective / Hunter Judge<br/><b>System:</b> Hunter (1st edition, with various rules lifted from Exalted 2ed, &amp; lots of freeform)<br/><b>Stuff he's good at:</b> doing a little bit of everything, talking to people, being patient with people, finding monsters, not freaking out<br/><b>Stuff he's bad at:</b> killing badass werewolves, killing sympathetic zombies, supernatural juju <br/><b>What you like about this character in general:</b> He's a good guy, at heart, well-rounded, dependable, and patient. But maybe a little too patient, you know? We finished the game without getting to a scene where he would just *snap* - but it was great when we came close a couple of times!<br/><b>What you like most about playing this character:</b> He worked with our "creepy low-key horror investigation" game setup perfectly, fitting right in with the other pc (a Visionary/Martyr street person &amp; thief). Also, it's a blast to play the straight man &amp; competant (but mundane) character alongside a total card with mad supernatural juju!<br/><b>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?:</b> It is amazing seeing in action just how much the right game setup and properly intertwined character concepts can make for an awesome game.<br/><b>Anything else:</b> I'd really like to play Stark again, in a more conflict-resolution-y kind of game...                        </div>

<b>Character Name:</b> John Hayes ("Iron John")<br/>
<br/>
<b>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell:</b> Darwinian poster child/brutal thug<br/>
<br/>
<b>System:</b> oWoD Vampire LARP<br/>
<br/>
<b>Stuff he's good at:</b> Breaking things and people, unrestrained bloodshed, senseless slaughter, consuming the blood of random supernatural creatures (werewolves, demons, etc.) "just to see"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Stuff he's bad at:</b> Subtlety, compassion, knowing when to quit<br/>
<br/>
<b>What you like about this character in general:</b> He's honest. He doesn't play games. If he hates you, he'll say so.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What you like most about playing this character:</b>The simplicity -- if there's a choice to be made, just go with the most brutal, violent, and destructive option. If not, just flip a coin, because that's how he rolls.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?</b>: Well, a friend figured out a sneaky way to blood bond him, and started doing so. Then she decided that she didn't really want a crazy-ass rabid badger like Iron John bound to her. That made me smile.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anything else:</b> Fortitude 5 coupled with Stamina 5 is impressively tough.                        </div>

<b>Character:</b> John Avon, callsign <i>Cancer</i><br/><br/><b>Game:</b> Post apocalyptic supers, defending the sealed habitats mankind survives in.<br/><br/><b>Concept:</b> A man who's body's repair systems are rapaging out of control.  His cells reproduce continuously and at an insane rate.  Its like his entire body is a still-funtional cancer.<br/><br/>When he was first discovered he was a tumescent, predatory mass of flesh and bone the size of a small village and insane with pain.  It took extensive drug treatments to bring his systems back under control and return him to human form.  Even now he needs a machine in his chest pumping industrial-grade poisons throughout his body to keep him in check.<br/><br/>As an agent of Aegis he has trained to bring his body under control.  With effort, he can diect the growth of his body, to "hulk out", or sprout bony spikes from under his skin.  Mostly though, he just doesn't die.  He ahs a custom made uniform composed largely of straps and "EZ-burst" seams, designed to give way rather than break when he lets lose.<br/><br/>I came up with some other background stuff about personality and vague memories of experiments before he became a living tumour.  But to be honest I barely cared about that fluff.  This character was all about the kewl powerz.  <br/><br/><b>System:</b> Truth and justice<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's good at:</b> Staying alive.  Regeneration is his marquee power and I stunted it to the hilt (in defiance of people who said such a thing wasn't possible).  He has let people punch straight through him, only to heal up around their arm and trap it inside him.  He has torn off his own arm to plug a burst chemical pipe with "instant-tumour".  Against an undead "necrosphere" he jumped straight inside it so that his body's defense systems would break it down as they would any dead tissue.  Jumping from a stupid hieght, knowing that his legs would un-shatter themselves straight away.<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's not so good at:</b> Keeping under control.  A couple of times the safeguards have broken down. or proved insufficient and he's gone all Tetsuo, requiring instant action by everyone else to prevent a serious disaster.  Also, he can't dish the pain out nearly as well as he can take it.  He has to win fights by attrition.<br/><br/><b>What I like about him in general:</b> Personal injury being a non-issue.  I know that no matter what crazy stuff I try, or no matetr how badly the dice fall I can be up and active again in a turn or two.  I never had to worry about sitting out.  Even when my main role was getting pummeled, I was able to have fun with that by banter and OTT descriptions of what was happening , since it just wasn't as serious for this character.  "Ouch, my organs.  Ah well, plenty more where they came from.  My spleen!  Well, I probably wasn't using it anyway..."<br/><br/>Plus, it's wonderfully badass to be able to take everything the world can dish out, then stand back up again and just say "meh" (which sort-of became this character's catch-phrase).  <br/><br/>Also, great visuals.  Growing fingers down the length of his arms to help grapple an electric jellyfish.  Melding one forearm together into a dense bony spike/shield.  Or just having fun pulling himself back together after a particularly bad experience.<br/><br/><b>Poignant thoughts:</b>  I wasn't entirely satisfied with how the character worked within the system.  I often had to fudge things from the player side, burning hero points to try and justify the actions I was describing and needing to point out that stuff that wasn't explicitly a part of my regeneration power was just colour.  A lot of the time it felt like a surcharge was being applied for being creative.  And the whiff factor defintiely came into play, which was especially frustrating after I'd loaded a roll up with hero points.  Still, I recognise that at least a part of that was due to me trying to "colour outside the lines" to begin with.                        </div>

<b>Character Name: </b>Brother Konrad Schreiffer<br/><br/><b>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell: </b>newly initiated priest of learning and justice (Verena, for those of you who know WFRP)<br/><br/><b>System: </b>WFRP 2e<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's good at: </b>being a know it all, being judgmental, thinking things through and, bizarrely, hitting stuff with his sword ("For Great Justice!)<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's bad at: </b>coming to a quick decision, letting little things go, being merciful, getting to the point<br/>What you like about this character in general: his naivety at first, when he was fresh out of the seminary, and everything was new to him. Now as he tries to become a full-blown priest I love the way people look to him to pass judgment or enact justice, and how he is beginning to grow into his role as a judge and a champion of justice.<br/><br/><b>What you like most about playing this character:</b> his big long speeches that make the other players all roll their eyes. His oaths and cries to Verena in combat to guide his blade which invariably prompt miss after miss, followed by "aah screw it!" and a hit.<br/><br/><b>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?: s</b>ometimes being a judge is hard, especially one without bias. My first judgment was on a group of bandits who had been brutalising a village. I wouldn't let them be executed without a trial, so we had what was effectively a show trial. The villagers wanted blood, I wanted justice, and couldn't just order their deaths. So we tied rocks to them and threw them in the river "to let Verena decide" - the truly guilty drowned, the innocent got to the other side and survived. I felt sick afterwards (in real life), as 9 out of 10 bandits drowned by my hand.<br/><br/><b>Anything else: </b>the symbol of Verena is an owl, and at one point we ordered a captive to swear an oath to Verena that they wouldnt come back and kill us if we set them free. So I forced them down on their knees and thrust my holy symbol in their face with a "KISS THE OWL!" that has since passed into infamy as a catchphrase.                        </div>

That looked like a female Gomez Addams.<br/><b>System:</b> The Shab-al-Hiri Roach<br/><b>Stuff she's good at:</b> Seducing young jocks. Repenting without really meaning it.<br/><b>Stuff she's bad at:</b> Killing people and putting the blame on others. <br/><b>What you like about this character in general:</b> Not much to be honest. Well, it should be her joie de vivre then.<br/><b>What you like most about playing this character:</b> Sort of felling sorry for her and trying really hard to make her change her ways. And failing.<br/><b>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?:</b> Some unease about whether she was a dark bloated version of my suppressed sexuality.<br/><br/>I actually got an urge to play one of the other characters in this thread. And that's John Harper's Nine Worlds PC. Just saying.                        </div>

<b>Character Name</b>: Philoctetes<br/><br/><b>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell</b>: Jovian Secret Agent/Patsy<br/><br/><b>System</b>: Nine Worlds<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's good at</b>: Getting talked into doing questionable and/or dangerous things by beautiful women<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's bad at</b>: Choosing allies<br/><br/><b>What you like about this character in general</b>: I like that he basically tries to be a good guy even though his job requires him to lie all the time to people who would otherwise be his friends.  I like that he has no ability to stand up to women.  I like that he has the most success when he's trying to help other people and almost no success when he's looking out for himself.  <br/><br/><b>What you like most about playing this character</b>: In a system like Nine Worlds, it is fun to get to be a patsy.  You can do neat things with self-delusional Muses.  Also, I like getting to play up his anxiety over being revealed as a spy.<br/><br/><b>Poignant thoughts</b>: Having strong political convictions can lead to really screwed up personal committments.                        </div>

<b>Character Name:</b> Lutra Spirit-Talker<br/><br/><b>Archetype/Class/In a Nutshell:</b> Albino ratkin shaman with a bit of a martyr complex<br/><br/><b>System:</b> The Shadow of Yesterday<br/><br/><b>Stuff She's Good At:</b> Talking people into or out of things, especially other ratkin.  Sticking up for the downtrodden.  Healing the physically and mentally wounded, whether she knows them or not.  Getting all spooky and having prophetic dreams and talking to the Ancestors, then turning around and behaving with extreme practicality and level-headedness.  Walking into situations that she knows are dangerous, because she also knows it's just what she has to do.<br/><br/><b>Stuff She's Bad At:</b>  Sticking up for herself, behaving selfishly (in a good way), and believing in her own right to happiness.  Fighting; even though her stats at this point are relatively good, she still seems to do really poorly whenever she has to rely on her teeth and claws.  Ignoring a cry for help even when she suspects it's a trap.<br/><br/><b>What You Like About This Character in General:</b>  I love the contrast between her outward and inner lives.  Outwardly she's fiercely determined and gives the appearance of always knowing what's right and what should be done next.  She has enormous compassion and a great deal of spiritual power, and she comes off as having this aura of... not holiness, really, but blessedness.  Inwardly, she's extremely scared and lonely.  She's never really had friends before, and she still has trouble with the idea that other people might want to care for and protect her the way she does for them.  This is especially enjoyable to me because when I first conceived of the character, I had the outward stuff, but not all the inward conflicts, and once those came together she really started to pop.  I also like that while she's overall a very serious character, she does have a certain amount of droll humor that comes out at unexpected moments.<br/><br/><b>What You Like Most About Playing This Character:</b>  The thing I'm enjoying most right now is her relationship with Tip, another ratkin PC.  Tip is pretty much her exact opposite, but Lutra's had visions about a great destiny in store for him, so she's assigned herself to protect him.  Along the way they have become very close friends and trust each other deeply, but the whole "friend" concept is still kind of fuzzy to Lutra and she's struggling with letting down her guard.  In spite of this they often fall into easy banter with each other, which is a hell of a lot of fun in an otherwise super-serious campaign.<br/><br/><b>Poignant Thoughts:</b>  I feel like Lutra really deserves a full-scale meltdown/freakout at some point, but I'm not sure if emotionally I'm able to do this.  Every time I've thought it was going to happen, she just cranked down and muscled through.  Maybe it just wasn't time yet.<br/><br/><b>Anything Else?:</b> I'm super excited by Lutra's current arch-nemesis.  It's kind of a cliche -- Lutra's sister, presumed dead, has just reappeared and wrongly blames Lutra for the destruction of her former warren.  But it's such a perfect quandry for Lutra, because her sister's her last link to her old life, but she's also insane and threatening the people Lutra cares about.  So Lutra wants to protect her chosen family and carries a lot of anger toward her sister -- but she's also compelled to heal the sick, and her sister needs healing.  It's so nice and emotionally crunchy.                        </div>

<b>Character Name: </b> Gavin â€˜Union Jackâ€™ Jackson<br/><b>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell: </b> Liverpudlian boxer trying to make it big in the USA, New Jersey in 1983 to be precise<br/><b>System: </b> Contenders<br/><b>Stuff he's good at: </b>  Boxing, but only against opponents who are old and past their best (so far). <br/><b>Stuff he's bad at: </b>  Maintaining any kind of reasonable relationship with his 15 year old little sister, showing any kind of gratitude towards those who are trying to help him out.<br/><b>What you like about this character in general: </b>  He tries, he really does, but sometimes he just doesnâ€™t get it. Like trying to buy his sisters affection with a trip to New York, then leaving her standing out in the rain while he watches band play for three hours. His endearingly useless attempts to get â€˜inâ€™ with local crime bosses that always seems to end up in him getting screwed over in some way.<br/><b>What you like most about playing this character: </b>  That while heâ€™s a character determined to succeed and break in to the big time of boxing, he has the sneaking suspicion that heâ€™s just another schmuck on the street whoâ€™ll never amount to nothing. <br/><b>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?: </b>  Not sure at the moment, the final session of the game will likely give more food for thought here. But the crunch point of when the relationship between him and his sister went sour, probably permanently, and the tale of their silent journey back to New Jersey, was one of the best moments for me. Unlike the other characters in the game, Jackson doesnâ€™t really have anyone else, making the loss of his sister all the more hurtful for him.                        </div>

                            This is a character my girlfriend played in a recent game that I GMed.<br/>
<br/>
Character Name: Brona<br/>
<br/>
Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell: Young MelnibonÃ©an-style Sorceress<br/>
<br/>
System: Sorcerer &amp; Sword<br/>
<br/>
Stuff she's good at: Sorcery, deceit, intimidation, ripping people apart<br/>
<br/>
Stuff she's bad at: Sincerity, love<br/>
<br/>
What you like about this character in general: She really fits into the genre and setting; tall, pale, beautiful and merciless. She really kicks ass when joining forces with her demon in combat (her demon can turn her into his own image).<br/>
<br/>
What you like most about how the player plays that character: I like that my girlfriend enjoys playing with me. I like how she makes a perfect Swords &amp; Sorcery protagonist without ever having read any of the source literature, and how she makes a pretty scary kicker just like that.<br/>
<br/>
Any poignant thoughts after playing this character: She wanted a man. Found out some pretty disgusting stuff about him. Still wanted him. Blackmailed him into having sex with her. Then, when he still refused to marry her, abandoned him to the Inquisition. Should I be worried? ;-)                        </div>

                            This is from "Basingrad", a one off PtA game I played at CON-crete Cow this last weekend:<br><br><b>System:</b> PtA<br><br><b>Series:</b> "Basingrad".  The series was a very dark comedy set during an uneasy cold war between regular folk and the "Living Impaired" some years after a Romero style zombie uprising.  Some Zombies, (the ones who got to eat enough brains during the uprising) are basically the same as they were when they were alive.  We decided that the setting for the game was going to be a walled city somewhere in the wastelands/DMZ between the surviving human nation and the new nation built by the "smart" zombies.  Kinda like cold war Berlin, except we have the smart zombies co-existing alongside the folks who haven't died yet, and a big wall keeping the mindless zombies out.  There's this peace between the Living and the Dead because while the dead just have to outlast the living in order to take over the world, the living have nukes and have made it clear they'd rather blast the entire world than give in to a zombie planet.<br><br>We chose Basingstoke as the city, because it's a pretty bleak and horrible place and also quite naff, which appeals to the English sense of humour.  Plus, we were in Milton Keynes and that's the usual "crap town" people bring up in such circumstances, so denied that we went with Basingstoke.*<br><br>One of the things we decide on was that a theme of excessive political correctness would work well, it's a mainstay of Brit humour.  "The Z Word" is a very politically incorrect thing to say, much like "The N Word" in real life.  The term "Living Impaired" seem suitably absurd.<br><br><b>Character Name:</b> Sgt Clint Oxley<br><br><b>Concept:</b> Veteran Zombie Cop.  Clint died early in the Zombie uprising and ate enough brains to be pretty much the man he was before the whole thing started.  Except while he was dead, his wife re-married and he still has to put in another 7 years before his pension is ready for him to retire.<br><br>Clint's partnered up with Kevin, a rookie cop who's also alive.  We've been partnered together as part of an initiative to get the living and the Living Impaired working together publicly.  Clint's quite bitter about being dead, and resents the fact that Kevin's not.<br><br>He's about two thirds Gene Hunt from Life On Mars and one third Judge Dredd. (or one third Vic Mackie, one third Dirty Harry and one one third The Terminator if you prefer)<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's good at:</b> Being a badass, catching bad guys and getting things done.<br/><br/><b>Stuff he's bad at:</b> Being sympathetic towards the living, being nice to anyone, cutting Kevin some slack.<br/><br/><b>What you like about this character in general:</b> The chemistry between him and Kevin worked really well.  Clint thinks Kevin's an idiot because he's got no real idea what the street are like.  Kevin thinks Clint's not doing things right, because he's not doing things the way they teach you in the academy.<br/><br/><b>What you like most about playing this character:</b> Calling Kevin an idiot and getting Fanmail for it.<br/><br/><b>Anything else:</b> Oh man, PtA is fucking awesome.  We went from nothing to a really cool series premise in about 30 minutes, and then played out an amazing and very complete feeling episode in two hours.  That truly rocks.<br/><br/><br/>* If you ask most Brits to name a truly crap town in southern England and they'll probably say either Milton Keynes or Basingstoke.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<b>Character Name:</b> Harriet Blount, the Pie Lady. 68 years old -  60 years of clean living and 8 years of demonic sorcery.<br/><b>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell:</b> Crazy old busy-body with the eternal tag-sale. Kinda like the Log Lady from Twin Peaks.<br/><b>System:</b>Sorcerer<br/><b>Stuff she's good at:</b> Finding out your secrets, making semi-decent pie, appearing harmless, nursing a grudge, meddling, standing firm in her beliefs, fighting the good fight against developers and polluters and other no-gooders. Being nice to school-children and cutting local so-called politicians down to size, maybe literally.<br/><b>Stuff she's bad at:</b> Making really great pie, letting things go, ignoring a mystery, holding her tounge.<br/><b>What you like about this character in general: </b>She's totally batty. She lives alone with her cat, Cat, who thinks his name is Georgie because Harriet is always talking to her demon. I like that she's a sorceress who would probably kill you for illegal dumping, but is basically a civic-minded person. Has a legal Glock in her umbrella stand.<br/><b>What you like most about playing this character:</b> I get really in-character with her. She has a distinctive voice and body postures that are really clear. <br/><b>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?:</b> I've recently spend three days with my 90 yo grandmother, and I suspect there's a lot of unconscious "what would it be like to be older and alone" going on with Harriet.<br/><b>Anything else:</b>Her kicker started out as upset that the town board was talking about repealing the recycling ordinance, plus the woman who won Best Pie at the fair cheated.                        </div>

<b>Character Name:  </b>Egbert "Sunny" Partidge<br/><b>Archeype/Class/In A Nutshell:  </b>Preacher With Guns<br/><b>System:  </b>TSOY in the 'Verse<br/><b>Stuff he's good at: </b> Being reluctant, defending his family<br/><b>Stuff he's bad at: </b> Succeeding at anything<br/><b>What you like about this character in general: </b> His sort of moral story arc, from money-hungry bounty hunter to terrorist outlaw.<br/><b>What you like most about playing this character: </b>He's fun to play and full of interesting drama.  Plus he just fell in love with a bad Browncoat lady.<br/><b>Any poignant thoughts after playing this character?: </b> He's nominally a Shepherd, wears the collar and all, and is faithful in his own way.  But last night I bought off Key of the Pacifist and replaced it with Key of Vengeance when some Syndicate thugs kidnapped his sister Kate.  Now he is a true PWG!  And he's got a posse of two dozen orphans.                        </div>
