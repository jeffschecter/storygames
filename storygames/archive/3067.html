Now for the caveats.<br/><br/>Caveat #1: The primary writer and game designer is not being paid for his time, and will only get something even approaching adequate compensation per hour if the game is a pretty big hit.  I spent literally hundreds of hours writing <em>FLFS</em>, and if I were freelancing I would have got a paycheck for those hours.  As it is now, <em>FLFS</em> is like two hundred bucks over break-even.  Doing the math, I've not been paid very well for my hours.<br/><br/>Caveat #2: I do think that indie games are more likely to contain free work for the purposes of getting the worker's name out there.  <em>FLFS</em> has art by Kirk Mitchell, for instance, who gave me art in exchange for a byline and no cash.<br/><br/>Caveat #3: There are also the charity games that crop up in indie-land, like <em>Story Games Names Project</em>, which has donated art and layout (note: I'm the free layout, and I'm the reason it's been delayed for so long).<br/><br/>Caveat #4: Proofing.  There is a lot of proofreading-for-free in the indie game world, usually attached to playtesting (which is also done for free).  In my day job, proofreading gets $12 an hour to start, and those costs are not visited onto indie games.  Additionally, I've seen a lot of folks offer to do full-on copyedits for free because they want to see the game rock.  I don't think that these free services are to boost the community, though: they're almost always to boost one specific book that people want to see do well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70192/#Comment_70192" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T10:02:02+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 10:02AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I buy into the idea of mutualism - helping people out and sharing my love for games and benefiting from the same, in turn.

In turn, many people have done the same for me, from playtesting to talking through ideas to sorting thousands of cards on my living room table.

For me the answer is no (at least for projects intended for sale), outside a mentorship relationship (or possibly charitable work). <br/><br/>Indie isn't about free, it's about DIY. There has been a strong spirit of mutualism and communal support in the past. That doesn't mean that all work is for cash remuneration. Trade in kind is reasonably common.<br/><br/>I've provided editing for Michael Miller, Nathan Paoletta, and Luke, of course. All of them have paid me for my services (though admittedly, my rates for RPG designers aren't even close to my rates for my day job...I do it because I enjoy being involved, not because I'm making any money). Luke pays me as the editor, he pays the two to three copy editors we use for projects, and he pays the artists who he's commissioned. He does all the layout himself.<br/><br/>For me, indie publishing (at least the for-profit side of things) is about making sure that everybody gets paid fairly for their work and everybody retains ownership of their intellectual property.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70196/#Comment_70196" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T10:12:58+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 10:12AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess we need to define what "work" means.<br/><br/>I give suggestions and stuff for free all the time.

If someone were to come to me and say, "hey, would you illustrate, photograph, and layout my game book. I can pay you $100 and a sammich" if i was interested in the project i would likely do it. If someone were to come to me and say "Hey would you do the design work for my ad campaign, we're selling BMWs" that sammich isn't going to look quite as tasty. I can't charge my normal professional rates to indie publishers because they wouldn't be able to afford it, and then i wouldn't get any work, and then no one would be happy. <br/><br/>There is also an inverse proportion of how much i'll charge to how excited i am by the material. "its just like D&amp;D but more ninjas" is going to cost you more than "The american dream laid bare, but with more ninjas" because thats what i'm into.

That's awesome.  Whether or not it's accurate, it's certainly close enough to sting.<br/><br/>I do think that the statement implies that people are getting used (under-compensated), which I don't think is the case.  Indie games are not industry games (that's what makes them indie), and this is applying industry standards of compensation to indie publishing.  If a publishing house asked me to do free or low-priced work, I'd laugh at them.  But I'll copyedit <em>Heads of State</em> at the drop of a hat.  The decision is made under a completely different set of standards.<br/><br/>There are a lot of statements about 'profitability', though, that neglect to account for all the contributions involved in the project and gloss over things that would be profoundly affected by a shift in scale.  Sure, a successful indie game may do well on a percentage ROI basis, but comparing, say, <em>Agon's</em> ROI ratio to Green Ronin's is overlooking a LOT of factors.  And that's our bad -- I find a lot of the pro-indie gloating that favorably compares indie to industry to be disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70205/#Comment_70205" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T10:46:59+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 10:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>"Indie publishing uses the goodwill of the community as a pretense to under-compensate people involved in production, and then boasts about the profitability of the model."</blockquote>\nYes, goodwill is a factor, but two issues about the above quote.<br/><br/>First there's the issue of scale.

It is almost certainly true that generally speaking indie publishers pay less for services such as artwork than more mainstream publishers. However, as a general rule, most artists are not at the point where they are turning down work because they have too much of it. So, there's no opportunity cost for them in doing the additional work for the indie publisher at a lower rate than their other work for the mainstream publisher at a higher rate.<br/><br/>And, Buzz, indie publishers often crow about "profitability", but it is in the sense of "Hey, I actually made enough on my book to turn <i>a</i> profit" -NOT- "My book is so profitable, I'm retiring to the French Riviera."

We pay market prices for our art.  We sometimes get good deals because Fred is very good at negotiating these things and, more importantly, because we actually pay on time (something that is not necessarily common in the pro world).  Art is a huge part of our cost, and some artists cost more than others.  I can get cheaper art from some new guy on Deviant Art because he's new.  After he does good work for a while, he can charge more. It's a natural process, and for excellent proof of it, consider that Jennifer Rodgers is going to be priced out of a lot of people's range because she's done so much high quality work.<br/><br/>Most small press games are very conscious of costs, and there are a number of routes to inexpensive art - clip art collections can go a long way - and going with a new artist is an option.  But this is equally true for anyone producing a DIY products, including d20 publishers.  To say that this dynamic is different for indie games in some way is, pretty clearly, just axe grinding.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70210/#Comment_70210" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T10:52:35+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 10:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (As an aside, if one wants to scratch the "indie" and suggest that the RPG industry as a whole is a little exploitative, well, I'd have a harder time arguing against that.)<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

The phrase "for free" is nonsensical.  Something cannot be for a non-value.  It can be "for nothing", "free of chrage" or just plain "free".  I'm mostly joking.<br/><br/>As for the question at hand, as a newbie here, I find the amount of free advice from indie designers really disconcerting.  I keep thinking, "why are you telling me this, this is pure gold!  You should go write my game, are you insane? You could be a dozen-aire!"  <br/><br/>I try to "give back" by offering my thoughts on other people's designs, but since I am a newb, the best I can offer is a more customer-centric look such as "I might buy this; this confuses me; why do you say this?" statements.  I don't think the barter I offer is worth it.  Its like a 10 year giving bike lessons to a professional rider.  But hey, I doubt anyone wants free advice on management and that's my only marketable skill. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70241/#Comment_70241" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T12:03:15+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 12:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2007 12:03PM by Graham.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

Here's me trying to course-correct:<br/><br/>Malcolm Sheppard is a freelance author.  I'm not sure if he does freelance writing full-time or not, but either way I am sure that he'd like his freelance writing to be a stable source of income.  He is very much a part of the mainstream network of freelance writers, and he is pretty heavily invested in it.  He likes it, and that's totally his perogative.  Speaking from experience, there's a lot of really cool aspects of doing that work.  So bully for him.<br/><br/>By the standards of that network, lots of "the indie model" are pretty alien or downright crazy.  I guarantee that he has had to be aggressive in actually getting paid for his work on at least one occasion.  A model where compensation is more casual seems like crazytalk, <em>especially</em> to a writer who counts on and depends on his freelance earnings as a significant portion of his income.<br/><br/>To the extent that indie games are "on the rise" or at least continually presented as such, and are also competitors to the mainstream, this crazytalk collective may very easily be seen as a direct threat to the freelance network of which Malcolm is a part, and thereby a direct threat to his personal bottom line.  If there are writers (or editors, artists, layout artists, etc) out there who will do work 'for free' that makes his career of charging real go-buy-groceries money a little more difficult.  A sensible, if perhaps cutthroat, response is to attack the quality and ethics of the people who are seen as threatening to his well-being.<br/><br/>Note, too, that if Malcolm has a family, all of that gets even worse; then he's defending his ability to feed his kids, and really, are you not going to sympathize with that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70254/#Comment_70254" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T12:32:02+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 12:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've pretty much paid artists what they've asked to be paid.

None of you have every paid me less then what I asked or been anything but timely or fair. That's a huge difference from working for the more mainstream companies. There have been times when I've charged someone here less then my standard rate to work on a project, but that was becuase I wanted to work on the project and the individual had a budget.

I'm here to share facts.  Here are my facts.  Form whatever opinions you want.<br/><br/>- Evil Hat pays its artists.<br/>- Evil Hat has rarely paid its writers, largely because most of it is fan-donated or in-house.<br/>- Evil Hat hasn't paid its editors -- again, in-house.<br/>- Evil Hat doesn't pay its layout folks -- in other words, me -- for the layout.  Completely in-house.<br/>- Indeed, the desire to pay folks who aren't in-house is why so much has stayed in-house so far: Fred, Rob, Lenny, and Lydia have done nearly the entirety of everything mentioned so far <i>except</i> for the art; the art always gets some kind of budget, even if it's "$50 to buy stock photos" with the stock photos then processed into something more art-like... in-house.<br/><br/>Much of the in-house stuff is, in bits and pieces, going out-of-house on some future projects.  I don't bank on being able to trade in social capital (i.e., friendship) for free efforts for folks who aren't part of the Evil Hat core, though I have used it before to angle for some preferential pricing.<br/><br/>If I were to draw some tenuous conclusions from my own experience, I would say my own indie ethos is more about "do stuff for free with friends and dedicated fans who are excited about what you're doing; but try to pay the folks who don't fit that bill."<br/><br/>My buddy Lenny Balsera is probably the most border case of the four in the Evil Hat core.  He was a fan from the Fate fan community, and just ended up talking to me -- a LOT -- in IM one day.  I dug how his brain worked, and bit by bit drew him into conversations about developing Fate, and eventually got him on an internal mailing list to talk about where we could take it.  His fingerprints are all over SOTC; it wouldn't work the way it does today if Lenny hadn't devil's advocated Rob and myself into actually putting on the page what we actually wanted the game to do at the table.  He's gotten paid not a lick of actual cash for his efforts (just like Lydia, Rob, and myself haven't -- but the difference here is that Lydia/Rob/Fred hang out together in real life, while Lenny's squirrelled away in Vegas and wasn't a pre-existing member of our social circle).<br/><br/>But I have tried to pay him in other ways -- in "joy capital", if that makes any sense, rather than actual money.  And he is getting a bunch of his expenses for GenCon this year paid for.  And SOTC has been nicely high-profile and has acted as a great opportunity for Lenny to make connections and inroads in the gaming industry that he hadn't made before.<br/><br/>I still feel guilty at times about the not-paying thing, and I've confessed it to Lenny on many an occasion.  I feel guilty because I'm human, and I'm running a small press because I love games and I share that game-love with Lenny... and I like to think the friendship we built while working on SOTC is one we're both getting dividends on.<br/><br/>I still feel like SOTC's been pretty profitable, even if we haven't chosen to spend those profits to pay folks for their time.  With their support and permission, those profits have been put towards future projects.  Make of that what you will.  It's not a "boast".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70316/#Comment_70316" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T15:17:50+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  3:17PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is Fred's case really any different from non-indie publishers?

Put a few of those together, plus work for the big guys, and it's not hard to live on that, in the right area.   I'd venture that he was making more on a monthly basis just in royalties from Adamant alone, than some of the Indie publishers were making on sales of their entire product lines during the same period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70319/#Comment_70319" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T15:34:03+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  3:34PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>Any criticism of the "Indie" movement is taken as a "us -vs- them" attack on some people's self-chosen indentity, even as players,  and so they're going to be looking to tear down that "attack."

When indie publishers tout sales, they are generally touting sales that would drive mainstream publishers to drink.

E.g., someone doing layout or art for free because it's an indie project, and that being a selling point of indie publishing.</blockquote>\nAs someone who is near a published product* for the first time, here's where I stand:  I've been published in Pyramid a couple times.  Last year I ran a horror serial on an online lit mag.  My first book* is coming out soon.  The editing work I've had for those has all been free, because I've talked with friends who edit for a living or are used to proofing for others, and they did what they did as a favor.  With my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> editor, Rachel, I've said on a number of occasions "I'm looking forward to the day when I'll have a project that'll actually let me pay you."  I rely on her so much that I sometimes feel guilty because I can't pay her.  She always waves away my apology and says "Ryan, I enjoy working on this stuff, so don't sweat it."<br/><br/>She's not doing the editing for free because it's an indie project or because of some community ideal, but because I'm a friend and she likes working with me.<br/><br/>My main photographer, Jeremy, does some damned amazing stuff for me, including the cover for Finis*.  I'd *love* to pay him, but I'm not making anything off this project &amp; I don't have a surplus of cash lying around, so I can't offer that.  He's does photography for me for free for similar reasons that Rachel does my editing -- he's a close friend of mine and he loves working with me on these projects.  Right now, he considers the fact that this is his first cover payment enough for the work he's put in, because he's got a lot of pride in it.<br/><br/>And then there's me.  I've put over a hundred hours &amp; a bit of cash for materials (for photography) into Finis, and I won't see a dime because it's for charity.  I started the project because it was this neat charity idea I had, but I'm finishing it because I like working with folks like Rachel, Jeremy &amp; Fred Hicks (who is doing the beautiful layout).  I'm not doing it for free because it's an indie project I feel obligated to do, but because it's a fun project.  Maybe the idea that indie projects under-compensate the people involved has some merit, but this isn't a situation where you can only look at monetary compensation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>"Indie publishing uses the goodwill of the community as a pretense to under-compensate people involved in production, and then boasts about the profitability of the model."</blockquote>\nIn fact, I'd say you can't look at monetary compensation on either side of the equation here.  I got $60 for my first Pyramid article &amp; a bit more for my second, and I'm in the hole a couple-three hundred right now for Finis.  Finis has profited more for me than my Pyramid articles, in terms of lessons learned and emotional &amp; other intangible rewards.<br/><br/>*Blantant plug for: <a href="http://www.tomorrowtheworldgames.com/finis/" rel="nofollow">Finis: A Book of Endings to Give People New Beginnings</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I mean, people get by on welfare, which is criminally low.<br/><br/>It seems that Malcolm is generally denigtrating indie publishers for poor practices in dealing with freelancers. I think you can find a great number of freelancers who would disagree with that assessment. By way of example, Jenn Rodgers and Lee Hammock have both been very effusive with their praise in my dealings with them. Obviously Malcolm's experience with indie publishers appears to have been a poor one. But extrapolating that experience to a generalization about indie publishers is wrong in both senses of the word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70328/#Comment_70328" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T16:16:39+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  4:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>GMSkarka</cite>Of course, he produces d20 material as part of his line, and doesn't have the "Forge" stamp of approval, so I guess he, like myself, doesn't count as "Indie."</blockquote>\nThis isn't the Forge, nor is it Forge II or Forge Lite.

Very, very little <i>writing</i> in the world of RPG publishing is work-for-hire. The vast majority of RPG text ever published has been creator-owned. Most of it has been self-published. It is the companies paying for work-for-hire that are the anomaly. Malcolm and others would <i>very much like</i> for that anomaly to have staying power. They would like there to be an "RPG Industry". It's unlikely to happen. Both trends in publishing and distribution and the shrinking audience for traditional tabletop RPGs, as well as the market dominance of deep-pocketed cross-medium companies (Hasbro/Wizards and whatever becomes of WWs merger with CCP) suggest that RPG publishing will return to its roots as a hobby press. Hobby presses rarely operate at a profit, and when they do, it is almost always because of vast quantities of uncompensated labor / unmonetized capital.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of folks dream of making a regular living as a freelancer in the "RPG Industry." It's really just not a realistic ambition. If you want to make a living, you need to work for a company that will be around for a while, or you need to own your product free and clear and have super-low marginal costs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70344/#Comment_70344" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T16:53:23+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  4:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>It is the companies paying for work-for-hire that are the anomaly.</blockquote>\nDo you have numbers to support this, because I have to question that.

This is the "I get candy today" mode.<br/><br/>I think a predominant mode of operation as someone participating in a a small, personal, passionate project is that you treat it like an investment; you show up, you work on it, and you expect that work to carry forward and get you something awesome later on. This is the "I get candy tomorrow" mode.<br/><br/>Both have their flaws.  The former is more risk-averse, better insulated, and some might say more "stable".  The latter is riskier, and requires operating on a foundation of deeper trust than is necessarily wise from a business perspective.  Your investment could yield you zero or even negative value.  But when it comes down to it, I'm a trust junkie.  I like extending it to others, and I like receiving it from others.  And I always feel it pays better dividends -- for my soul AND my pocket-book -- in the long run.<br/><br/>But that's for my taste.  To each his own, right?<br/><br/>As a side-bar, Gareth, I recognize that you essentially got your feelings hurt by the rejection back on '04 about the d20 stuff.  Let me step up right now and insist passionately that the rejection was bullshit*.  If you ever ARE willing to put that behind you, I'm dead-on certain you'd be welcome to buy into the Forge and demo your games alongside ours at GenCon.  I realize you have some potential conflict of interest worries there, since IPR's operating the cash register at GenCon, but I would hasten to point out that IPR's also doing that on behalf of people who aren't normally carried by IPR, so it's more that IPR is selling its cash register services to the Forge community rather than the other way around.  I'd also point out that Evil Hat isn't *that* strong of a Forge member when it comes down to it, but that the Forge booth still makes tons of sense for us for GenCon '07.  If you were bringing a certain Adventure Omnibus along for the ride... well, let me just say there'd be some cross-promotional value there.  Sign-ups are still going on until the beginning of June -- particulars may be found here: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23785.01" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23785.01</a> <br/><br/>I'd be happy to have you there, but I understand if you don't want to.  (Plus, you've probably already paid for your badge, and may want to be experiencing the con as a gamer first and a publisher second rather than the other way around; Evil Hat's part of the booth because we're definitely there as publisher first gamers second.)<br/><br/><i>Edit to add the asterisk:<br/><br/>* It's bullshit I think I understand the origin of -- the d20 (d20--not OGL!) license certainly encourages one to think that the creator of work based on the d20 License does not actually own the work since WOTC could yank back certain rights if they chose -- but it's still bullshit I disagree with.  It's not like turning a d20 game into an OGL game would take more than, what, 5 minutes of effort per hundred pages?  But even today folks get jumpy around the d20 designation because of those retraction terms.   But for someone to insist that the work y'all do with Adamant isn't indie kinda flies in the face of what I *want* indie to mean.  So, like I said: bullshit.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70353/#Comment_70353" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T17:41:01+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  5:41PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2007 5:44PM by Arminius.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (EDIT: this is in response to joepub's last post)<br/><br/>But whether people feel undercompensated is making an endrun around Malcolm's argument. He's saying that people are being paid in friendship to make up for underpaying them in cash, and the artificially boosted margin is then being compared unfairly to what the industry achieves.<br/><br/>I think if you want to understand Malcolm you have to bear in mind that he's reacting to claims emanating from the indie community--that the industry is a sham because it runs at a loss, and that it exploits its workers by underpaying them or stiffing them. And that indie games are kicking the industry's ass.<br/><br/>About those claims I'm agnostic except that I know a couple people who never got paid. I'm pretty sure Malcolm has himself written some pretty scathing words about publishers angling for freelancers at ridiculously low rates.<br/><br/>I can't speak for Malcolm but what I take away from his comment is that, <i>as businesses</i>, indie games don't fare much better than the industry; a sober comparison suggests that neither is especially profitable unless you ignore a lot of unpaid or discounted contributions, which are mostly made up by warm &amp; fuzzies. Where the industry clearly fails relative to indie games is those horror stories of artists/writers who never got their promised checks, people whose good faith was absolutely abused. But even though the "indie community" is blessedly free of that sort of thing, there are still questions to be asked about viewing indie publishing as a <i>business</i>. Not easy questions; in fact I could see them leaking into a questioning of our entire social-economic system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70354/#Comment_70354" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T17:48:07+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  5:48PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2007 5:51PM by iago.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>I think if you want to understand Malcolm you have to bear in mind that he's reacting to claims emanating from the indie community--that the industry is a sham because it runs at a loss, and that it exploits its workers by underpaying them or stiffing them.

Actually seeing what you're imagining is there is usually a much less intense experience.<br/><br/>To connect this to the topic, what I'm suggesting is that Malcolm believes the claims being made are a lot wilder and insistent and comprehensive than they actually are... but I <i>will</i> say his method of characterizing the folks sharing their joy is done in a way that makes him look petty and bitter rather than someone making a reasonable observation.<br/><br/>I mean, I recognize in those words some of the same stuff I've had said to me by Ken Hite in our correspondances.  Coming from Ken it was a fine point, a good point, a valid point.  I think Malcolm would end up making a lot more sense if he managed to turn off the bile spigots he has running at the ends of his fingertips when he types his take on things.  His language hurts feelings... the same way others' language hurt folks like GMS when he got told he wasn't "indie".<br/><br/>EDIT: Anyone interested in seeing the financial numbers on something like SOTC may feel free to ask me.  I have no qualms sharing them, I'm just disinclined to post them out in the open on the net.  I can even toss in a projection of what the profits would look like if we'd employed a strategy of dividing up the net profits as royalties to pay the paticipants.

What is the difference between an indie publisher and an RPG publisher who is just starting out? (E.g., my Green Ronin example.) I mean, isn't it the nature of startup companies and cottage industries that you take a risk, look for deals when you can get them, and make use of your social network?<br/><br/>I mean, people in this thread have demonstrated that they've gotten work from people for no money. But I'm not seeing that there was ever any <i>expectation</i> that this would happen. I simply see people pursuing a dream, and occasionally finding like-minded folk caught up in their wake. I see friends helping friends, the same way that I do web design work for little or no money for people I care about.<br/><br/>Someone how, I'm not seeing how this rates worse than <i>bona fide</i> big-name publishers paying freelancers a couple cents a word, or skipping out on paying people at all. I mean, this happens, right? Does that mean mainstream publishing is a total crock?

Most of us know people who do writing as work-for-hire -- look at any WotC, WW, or SJG product, and they're either written by staff writers or freelancers, but either way they aren't making creator-owned content.  And that's a lot of books.  I suspect neither side is an anomaly, but I don't have numbers to support that.<br/><br/>That's exactly it. SJG, WotC, TSR, WW... <i>they're the blip</i>. Take a look at John Kim's <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/" rel="nofollow">big list</a> of every RPG he's ever been able to find out about (which he admits leaves out a whole lot of freebies, small-circulation things, and the like). The vast majority of RPGs ever put down on paper (or bits) and put out there in the marketplace have been <i>labors of love</i>, not commercial projects. The "indie model" is how games have been made forever and ever. The revolutionary thing is that we're no longer stuck with the basement full of 800 unsold copies and a huge printer's bill if we have an idea we love.<br/><br/>The unrealistic thing is holding up SJG or White Wolf or TSR as our model of what success looks like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70369/#Comment_70369" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T19:16:50+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  7:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not exactly sure how useful this will be at this stage of the thread, but here goes anyway...<br/><br/>I'm Lenny Balsera, Evil Hat's fourth core person.<br/><br/>To add a little perspective to Fred's story about me, I'd like to mention that at the time when I "signed up" with Evil Hat, the "community goodwill", whatever that's supposed to mean, was furthest from my mind in terms of potential benefit from the association. Story Games didn't exist then, and my involvement at the Forge was minimal, save for some comedic flailings regarding the Big Model immortalized for all time in Ron's 'Narrativism: Story Now' essay. (I type that with a huge grin on, by the way, so you get the tone right.) Even now, I'm pretty distant from the social groups that comprise the community, such as it is, so I don't post too often.<br/><br/>The fact is, I probably could have requested a for-hire arrangement with Evil Hat if I'd wanted to, and I'm damn certain that Fred would either have done his level best to compensate me, or honestly told me he wasn't interested in working with me if I was going to stick to my guns on that. I didn't do it for a number of reasons, the most prominent of which is that I gain more benefits by being a member of Evil Hat than I would have as a for-hire contractor.<br/><br/>To name a few, it's pretty much guaranteed that I'll be able to publish any design I'd like that doesn't suck (by Rob and Fred's standards) under the Evil Hat banner, and that some (if not all) of the production costs will come out of the corporate account, and that layout, art direction, marketing, and proofing/editing will be free or close to free. This is all stuff I'd have to pay out of pocket without this association, and it would surely have cost me more than I'd have gotten for royalties or per-word off of SotC, even at standard market "mainstream" rates.<br/><br/>In addition, I've gotten a ton of exposure, and my first freelance for-hire gig. <br/><br/>So, yeah. I'm getting a ton of benefits that are far more substantial than "happy fun vibes" and have nothing to do with "advancing the community" or whatever. And I've never heard of anyone being pressured with the latter to work for cheap, free, or anything else. If one of you has, or has been so pressured, I'd be glad to see those stories become public.<br/><br/>As for Malcolm's post on ENWorld, which suggests I'm being used despite myself? It's insulting, to put it mildly.

For the record -- I have no problems with creator-owned niche-market publishing.   My entire business is focused on the Long Tail model.   It is not my hobby -- it is how I feed my family.   I'm lucky enough to be able to do what I love for a living.       What I have a problem with is the self-defined "Indie" movement, mostly because of it's "kewl kids club" self-perpetuated mystique, cults of personality, and hypocrisy.  As Mark W said above, the "indie model" is how most games have been published.   Where I differ is in the separation of "indie" from everyone else -- <br/><br/>To use an example, I know most of the folks who founded White Wolf.   They were just another "indie" group, publishing what they loved on home computers with pirated layout software.   They were successful enough that they became a large company (by this industry's standards, anyway).   To say that they're somehow different from the self-defined "Indie" guys is a fallacy.   They aren't.    Even with their current position, they're pretty much the same as any publisher....just on the larger end of the spectrum.    And I guess that's my point -- it's all the same spectrum.   Even people working at WOTC are doing it because they love it -- they could easily make more money riding a cubicle at Microsoft.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and regarding your offer of the Forge booth -- I've actually got a badge already (through another publisher), and might also have some of my stock available (a couple of publishers have expressed interest in offering me table-space for MARS, for example).   I'd have no problem bringing some stock of the Adventure Omnibus for you to sell at the Forge booth -- we can work something out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70378/#Comment_70378" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T21:15:03+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And don't people get scewed all the time working for big-name publishers, too?</blockquote>\nAll the time. Let me restate what I said before. I'm a full time freelance illustrator. I work for big companies, small companies, indie companies and mainstream companies. I have never dealt with an indie publisher that treated me badly. i have never been paid any less then exactly what I asked from an indie publisher. Usually this is as much or more (yes, more) then what larger companies are willing to pay me.<br/><br/>The other side of it? Almost every large company I have worked for has tried to skip out on paying me, sent payment months late, paid less then what they promised, or tried to get me to do work that I had not agreed to do.<br/><br/>Given my experiences, I would always prefer to work for an indie publisher. there are several larger publisers that I have good working relationships with, but they are a vast minority of the larger publishers I have done work for.<br/><br/>This industry is famous for it's poor treatment of freelancers. I'm happy to say that this just isn't the case (in my own experiences) with indie publishers.

I think you and I have no quarrel about the perspectives that actually matter here.  I try not to use the 'indie' label exclusively when I talk about the stuff in this market segment; I vary it with 'small press' a lot, and I think what motivates that is an unease that's not all that different from yours about the way that term tends to artificially slice the landscape up.  'Small press' at least makes a certain more amount of descriptive sense to me, though I admit 'Small Press Revolution' doesn't have the same 'ring' to it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I think, though, that Jake touches on an interesting point.  I think what folks are cognitively treating as a dividing line is the distinction between "publishers I know as people" and "publishers I know as a company-entity" -- though that's a continuum, not a binary state.  It's interesting to me what Jake is saying here about getting paid, etc -- I think his treatment by the "indie" (i.e., "people-publishers") folks comes out of that segment recognizing that they are their business, they are their reputation capital.  When they contract Jake to do art, that's an agreement arrived at between people as much as it is a business arrangement by a company.  That's where the personal, passionate thing I was talking about comes into play, too, something that I don't think is coincidental.  There's a cutover -- at least in terms of how a publisher is *perceived* -- when that publisher starts being more a company than an individual (or, as with Evil Hat, a small group of individuals)...<br/><br/>... I'm not sure where I'm going with that, save to point at what Jake's saying and going "ooh! there's something there! something new in this discussion!"

'Mainstream' was any game company that did have the capital to participate, and 'indie' was everyone who didn't.<br/><br/>With electronic distribution (and greater electronic readership), the web and PoD, the playing field has been leveled considerably, and with that flattening of distribution barriers, the line between mainstream and indie (which as GMS points out was a fallacy and an artifact of the 3-tier system, really) is going to vanish completely.<br/><br/>Really, there needs to be an acknowledgment in the 'indie' community that what they do is no different than what the creator of <i>Skyrealms of Jorune</i> did - it's just that the power allocated to the publisher is vastly different these days - and it will continue to change.<br/><br/>[Edit: There's also the issue of the <i>content</i> or <i>style</i> of indie games and the narrative bend of the Forge getting mixed into this heady brew, which doesn't make things any easier.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70389/#Comment_70389" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T21:58:04+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:58PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kuma,<br/><br/>thank you for that.

Good stuff happens too. <br/><br/>Once upon a time I worked with Dream Pod 9, and wrote a good chunk of Tribe 8 and occasional contribution bits of other games. Towards the end of my time writing for the company they got tight with money, and at one point asked me if I would accept not getting paid in order to "support the game." I told them no, they hired me as a professional, they were going to pay me as one. They did that time. The next time they said they wouldn't pay, flat out. I had a co-author's sister, who was a partner in a litigation and contract dispute specializing law firm, send them a letter on her letterhead. They paid me the next day and I never did another job for them. <br/><br/>Not long after that they got a lot of the folks on the Tribe 8 mailing list to do the Tribe 8 Players Guide. The whole community chipped in and did it all (so far as I know) on a volunteer basis -- I don't even think they got comp copies. The book came out, made enough money (as nothing was paid for production) to do Tribe 8 2nd edition. This time some of the folks who did the Player's Guide got brought on with the expectation that this was a professional gig, not just volunteer stuff. (Or at least so I was given to understand.) But after the book had been produced and brought out none of them got paid. Not only that but many of them, who'd worked damn hard on it, got cut out at cons -- not allowed to run official demos or even man the Pod booth. <br/><br/>There is no doubt in my brain that the Pod fucked people, used the spirit of community and fan-love and exploited people for their own profit. They were a business and they did not follow good business ethics. <br/><br/>In more recent times Fred Hicks and I got into a brawl on the blog-o-swinesphere. The upshot of it is he ended up hiring me to edit a book for Evil Hat. His first question to me is what my rate was. I told him I wasn't going to charge him, because I wanted to do this one pro bono. He insisted he be able to pay me, and I shot him down. He finally said that I at least had to take comps of some product, and I rolled my eyes and agreed. He really, really tried to pay me, and wanted to pay me a fair price. That I shot him down was my decision and something I did for a combination of personal reasons. <br/><br/>Really, doing a project for free because I want to support it is a choice I can make. If a friend was guilting me into I might feel taken advantage of -- but this wasn't that situation. This was my decision. And its in line with things I do outside RPGing anyway. My rates at editing and proofing and stuff are highly variable. If I'm proofing on an easy project for people I like, for example, my rate can be as low as $15 an hour. (Sometimes as low as $12 if I'm trying to pad out my CV in a particular area.) When I'm doing high end editing/graphic desing under pressure for law firms who are willing to pay me enough money that they don't have to treat me nicely, I get as much as $100 an hour. So what price I'm going to charge any given company for any given project is a highly variable thing. In this case I decided, on my own, that the price was nothing. And Fred just had to deal with that. <br/><br/>See, this thing I'm doing with Fred, for me, was a hobby thing and a personal thing. So business ethics and practices were only involved because Fred wanted to involve them. As far as I was concerned this was a different thing. <br/><br/>So the thing is that Malcolm is thinking about things in terms of this "thing" being a business, and following business ethics. Many of the Indie folks (not all) are thinking of it being a hobby they do with their friends, and so think of it in terms of personal ethics. Those two POVs are obviously going to have difference between them. Especially when folks are not always clear about what they are doing or why. Or at least when each individual may be clear but the "group" isn't because not every member of every group has the same agenda. I would not, for example, lump Green Ronin in with Louis Porter, or Wizards with Dream Pod 9. Nor will I automatically toss Clinton into the same pot as Evil Hat or Mob United. But because of the "indie/mainstream" binary we often end up doing that to each other. <br/><br/>I also think that GMS does have one point worth thinking about -- it isn't fair to compare gross profits on a work done partly or fully by volunteer labor with net profits on a book for which all the labor is paid for. And while I don't see that happening out of everyone in the "indie community" every day, I have occasionally heard folks compare two different ventures that are as alike as apples and oranges in terms of net vs. gross as though it was the meaningful measure. Of course, this also brings up the always tricky issue of knowing who was paid for what. A lot of products out there that were done "professionally" didn't pay people after all, and I know a lot of "indie don't pay" folks who do pay people in various ways -- sometimes even with money (shock gasp!) in a professional manner (shock gasp!). Just because a book is at the Forge booth doesn't mean everything in it wasn't paid for at a professional rate, and just because its at a big name shiny booth doesn't mean it was paid for at all. <br/><br/>For me it isn't. For me the freedom to set my own goals and decide if I want a given project to be professional or personal, and to chose what that means for me and how much I want to charge -- or not charge -- is the point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70401/#Comment_70401" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T00:35:57+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 12:35AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>It goes back even further than that.

Along with the idea that the <i>content</i> of games was new, it was conflated with the idea that the <i>means of production</i> of the games was new as well.  And to some extent it is new ... but the creator-owner model is the predominant one in the field, and always has been.  <br/><br/>People in this thread have been talking about 'the fence'.  There is no actual fence and never has been - just the perception of one generated by our growing up with the 3-tier distribution model with specialized retailers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70402/#Comment_70402" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T00:44:43+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 12:44AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>it isn't fair to compare gross profits on a work done partly or fully by volunteer labor with net profits on a book for which all the labor is paid for.</blockquote>\nGood post Brand.<br/><br/>I just wanted to point out (again) that many, many books which fall into the "labor is payed for" catagory are not actually... well, just because the publishers of these books say they are paying the people they hire doesn't mean they are. I don't disagree with what you are saying at all, but I always find it kind of amazing when other freelancers I know ask my why I do so much work for indie publishers when I could work for bigger companies. I always reply by asking when the last time they actually got paid was, how many months (or years) late was it, how much did they have to fight to get it, and was it worth the trouble?<br/><br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Jacobson</cite>My dispute of Malcolm's generalization with regard to one group that can be applied as a generalization equally to the inverse of that group.</blockquote>\nThis is true, but I don't know that Malcolm would say that any group is exclusively guilty of it. In fact, from what I know of Malcolm I don't think he would say that at all. No way he has only good things to say about a lot of mainstream publishers. <br/><br/>But here is the thing, what he's saying comes from a place where he believes that all for-profit ventures are businesses and should follow a certain set of ethics and practices. That includes paying people a fair rate for work, and only hiring out work you can afford to pay for. <br/><br/>I think Malcolm would argue (and if he would argue it, he would practice it in real life) that if you are a business and are going to be making money of a product, and someone wants to do part of the work for you, you should be paying them. If fans who love the game or freelancers needing to build up their reputation come and offer to work for free, you should probably pay them anyway. If folks generate material for you, and you are going to sell the material for profit, then as a business you should pay them for the things they are doing for you that are going to make you money. <br/><br/>I more or less agree with that -- in as much as what you are doing is a professional business. I am very, very deeply tired of the way that many companies (and companies can be one guy, yes) exploit work from fans. <br/><br/>But here is the thing, for a lot of us what we're doing in RPGs isn't a professional thing. I used to write freelance for RPG companies and self-published a couple of adventures. I did that for a couple years, then quit. Now days I work freelance in other fields and am happier about it. But I still sometimes like to do RPG stuff as a hobby. And what I expect from a hobby is different than what I expected from something I was doing professionally. Now days I do stuff for folks for free because that is what I want to do. My choice. Similarly, I think a lot of folks publishing as a thing they are doing to publish one book and have some fun, rather than as a professional or business issue, feel much the same and have friends that do as well. As a result they are going to work off a different set of assumptions - including about if they need to pay money to people who are  helping them make the book. And if those people are their friends and are all down with it, then I think it may well be a different situation that those who are using the general good will of strangers to get free work out of them. <br/><br/>So yea... what we're seeing isn't just a false split into groups on sides of a binary fence, but a real split over the professional and business ethics of being a publisher vs. the personal and community ethics of being a guy who makes a book. And while we may be able to get past the "indie vs not" thing, I really don't think that the other is going to be so easy, because it isn't just a mistake of category, it really is two different ways of looking at the fundamentals of what we're doing. <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As to the initial question of this thread... I'm going to have to answer, "Which Indie publishing model is that?" Because of folks that sell at the Forge, some may use free labor, but many do not. Of those who are selling creator owned material in other venues and communities some do use free labor, and many do not. So sure, some people do it, but not all, and some rigorously object to it. So I don't know that the question can be answered meaningfully without looking at specific cases. <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Finally, as to what defines Indie, or what does on the Forge, or what does for the Forge booth... I suggest checking out <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19891.30" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> because it really gets into some good stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70466/#Comment_70466" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T09:40:03+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  9:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>I think what folks are cognitively treating as a dividing line is the distinction between "publishers I know as people" and "publishers I know as a company-entity" -- though that's a continuum, not a binary state. </blockquote>\nBingo.

Period. <br/><br/>On <i>Dead Inside</i>, I did a mix of royalty (of net profit) and outright purchase of art/services.<br/>On <i>MNPR:RPG</i>, I purchased editing.<br/>On <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i>, I purchased art and editing.<br/>On <i>The Zorcerer of Zo</i>, I went with all royalties (of net profit).<br/><br/>For art that's purchased outright, I've paid $25 for quarter-page B&amp;W illos, $50 for half-page B&amp;W illos, and anywhere from $100 to $250 for color full page covers.<br/><br/>For editing that's purchased outright, I've paid between $50 (for 64 page book) to $100 (for 128 page book).<br/><br/>I think these numbers, while competitive (more-or-less) in RPG work, are fairly miniscule compared to other industries.<br/><br/>The royalty percentages for <i>ZoZ</i> break down to 40% writing (me), 35% art (split between artists), 15% layout, and 10% editing. (There's one or two refinements/deviations in there, but that's how it basically shakes out.) The six month sales of <i>ZoZ</i> have led to royalty numbers for the participants that are roughly equivalent to the money that they'd have received if services had been purchased-outright. Which means that after this, they'll be effectively be paid more than the usual work-for-hire amounts, so long as the book continues to sell. <br/><br/>When sales slacken on a product, I have offered to "buy-back" participants' royalty percentage with a flat final payment. This minimizes paperwork/royalty tracking as sales decrease, and puts a final lump payment into a particpant's hands.<br/><br/>(Goodwill and networking benefits are also included in working with ASMP, either as a participant or licensee, though those are kinda ad hoc -- I try to draw attention and support my friends/participants work in other venues via ad swaps, blog mentions, Overviews, purchases of their products, comp copies of my products, general advice/insights, connecting person X to person/opportunity Y, etc.)<br/><br/>Given the minimal margins of this industry, plus my own personal beliefs regarding "I do the job. I get paid.", I now believe that royalties (plus possible eventual royalty buyout) is <b>the</b> way to go for small -press RPG production. Participants are rewarded in all cases, and that reward is tied to the success of the product.<br/><br/>While ASMP is by no means generating enough cash for me to do it full-time, it does generate a nice second income -- enough such that I could quit the second job I had at the bookstore over this past holiday season.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70472/#Comment_70472" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T10:27:23+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 10:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And as far as the use of the term indie and its utility and accuracy goes, <a href="http://rob-donoghue.livejournal.com/259031.html" rel="nofollow">Rob Donoghue has said everything that needs to be said about it</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70473/#Comment_70473" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T10:27:33+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 10:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chad:<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing the royalty breakdown.

Whatever "side" of the "fence" you place yourself on, the crap that gets slung about is hitting a human being, that someone knows.

Is not wanting to become a professional because it might pay less when offered unethical?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's funny, because I have friends that would call me a lefty at times, but then on the subject of free market, I'm pretty firm.

There are projects that are unquestionably "hobby" projects, but as soon as the distinction begins to blur, it's your responsibility as a publisher to act in a professional manner. If you're going to take work from someone at below "market" rates, it should be for one of two reasons: 1) They have the same deal as you do (ownership stake in project or the company that can turn into cash money down the road if you "take off") or 2) they're "family" (either real relatives or unquestionably close friends who are benefitting pretty directly from contributing unpaid to your success.) <br/><br/>The situation Brand described upthread is the really unethical one -- offering "relationship capital" to people who don't currently possess it with you as a trade for their services. It's okay to "leech" off of someone who really is already a good, dear friend; it's not okay to bring someone into the circle in exchange for their unpaid or underpaid labor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71515/#Comment_71515" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T15:09:37+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  3:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I have seen too many people stiffed from payment to lump publishers into "professional" and "indie".
