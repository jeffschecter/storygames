                    Consider the following:<br/>
<br/>
bq. Never take a conflict to the system if you're unable to handle the defeat/loss result. If you have a problem, consider remapping your approach (so that you can come to a point where you can handle both a win or loss) and failing that, put the brakes on and discuss with your group what's going on.<br/>
<br/>
By "handling" the result, I mean that you can have that outcome without breaking your rubric for good story / good time, and that's all important regardless of your agenda or system.  I'm not letting games off the hook if they aren't supporting good/in-genre/fun/thematic results. (Remember our good friend FitM!) But even games supporting such things can result in an outcome you don't absolutely love. I think Vincent mentioned this a while ago in some advice to a player in Dogs: "If you want to keep your character as she is, don't player her." Or something like that?<br/>
<br/>
So here's an example in a recent game of Mage: my character, Crown, was a somewhat prideful religious type. He liked direct confrontation: his magic was very direct *WHAM* magic, rather than more subtle tricks of mind or fate. We were all attacked by malevolent spirits, and I failed my resistence check, despite having some strong stats in that area. And so Crown was temporarily possessed. What I chose to do was try a few times to resist (draining some willpower in the process), and finally blowing ALL my Willpower on a roll to break free; this failed, as well, and so not only was Crown possessed, but Crown was had gambled with one of his most important resources and lost, resulting in being stuck with a weak and crippled soul.<br/>
<br/>
My instant reaction was to feel deprotagonized, and starting to look into flaws within the WoD system. (And certainly come conflict resolution stuff would have been great in this case, or porting Duel of Wits mechanics to my negotiations with the spirit.) But: that wasn't actually the problem here.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to take a drastic gamble with a key aspect of my character, but was not prepared for the fallout from the potential negative outcome - being that I'd have drained my willpower without actually having gotten free. If I was uncomfortable with that possible outcome, I should have avoided that gamble, or perhaps even paused the game to address my concerns to the GM.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about Vincent's phrasing, and saw it apply here: I had chosen to make a gamble, and thus my character changed. When I loosened my grip on my character vision to encompass this change, I suddenly felt my creativity come back. Previously, I imagined Crown as an iron-willed protagonist, and couldn't imagine him broken; I broadened my view of him as an iron-willed protagonist _who nonetheless was broken, and must now cope with this fact_. I discussed this with the GM to make sure we could make this angle work out.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this is a potential skill for any player (including GMs) to have: realize when you're about to wager something you don't want to lose, and how to best avoid or adapt to the situation.                </div>

                            Dev, <br/><br/>Good points!<br/><br/>In your specific example, I have a question: did you chose to have the fight that started this all? Was it as a consequence of your decisions? Did the GM give you an option about doing the resistance rolls, or was there another way out? <br/><br/>I find it much easier to "roll with the punches" when they are punches that I knew were coming. When something happens as a result of the story I'm telling or the approach I'm taking, I'm willing to lose and take my lumps. But when I'm walking along one day and the GM jumps me with hostile spirits, makes me roll until I finally lose and then get possesed.... <br/><br/>The thing to realize at that point is that I'm not upset with the dice. I'm upset with the GM for putting me into a situation that I didn't ask for, didn't want, and didn't have any choice in confronting, dealing with, or escaping. <br/><br/>Which brings us back to the point of "put the brakes on and discuss with your group what's going on." The simple ability to do that and not feel like the loser in the group is so vitally important that I can't possibly over-stress it.                        </div>

                            Brand, in another thread you were dissing on in media res.  Is this why?  In media res just drops you into a situation that you did not take in-character choices to get yourself in, which may put you at a disadvantage you didn't "deserve."<br/><br/>Would your reaction be any different if the situation was based off of out-of-character choices you made?  So for a facile example, ina Buffy game if you chose to play the Slayer and I started off the game, "So you're fighting a vampire in the graveyard..."<br/><br/>Is it the integrity of your character's decision tree, or yours?                        </div>

                            Joshua, <br/><br/>Neither. I don't like en medias res in stories, in movies, or in anything. <br/><br/>DON'T LIKE THE MONKEY TOOL. <br/><br/>(I am thinking about doing a post that addresses this at some point, along with the F/T MB divide in gamer types and why they structure their games differently, but now I have to do a fucking post about genre theory....) <br/><br/>But, for the sake of argument, it would be my decision tree, not my characters. I don't immerse, so I care about two shakes for "what my character would do." <br/><br/>It is also possible to forcefully scene frame to put me into a situation and not have me balk. Mo does this sometimes in the game she's running for me at the moment, and when its done to obviously skip the crap and get to the choice, that's all good. <br/><br/>Its when there isn't a choice, "Be possesed or be possesed" or "be possesed or die" that I start getting into issues. And while I approve of Dev's taking control of his own reactions in his example, I would like more information about how the stakes and the context of the conflict came into being, and how much knowledge and choice he had around the blowing his willpower issue. <br/><br/>And you know how I tell the difference and how my group learns to tell one from the other and consistantly hit one mark? <br/><br/>Talkies!                        </div>

<p>Background as to what was specifically happening here: we all knew the game was going to start rather participation-ist-ish (it's based on a pre-scripted adventure), but also that we were going to go off the rails at the first opportunity (and the GM would follow our lead from then on out). In fact, we've already done that: this conflict with the ghosts is "supposed" to be easy, and we're "supposed" to fend them off, then hunt down the source, yadda yadda yadda, fight the sorceror who brought them. But instead, one of the cabal's Mages basically bound one of the ghosts to him. (And in my case, it seems like the opposite will be the case.)</p>
<p>So, this conflict was a semi-random encounter, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>The existence of these spirits was tied into the key hook of the game, i.e. the Vices that we define in character creation. Each player was attacked by a spirit of their own Vice - my guy was attacked by a spirit of Greed.</li>
<li>There was an initial roll to resist (I failed, most succeeded)</li>
<li>You could buy subsequent resist rolls with Willpower (I tried, but the way I wagered my WIllpower didn't work out)</li>
<li>You could negotiate with the demons or otherwise satiate them (I think I came close, but ultimately failed; I believe we did use the system here, rather than fiat.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think if I was GMing this, the whole "only wager what you want" thing would apply when I was judging the fitness of the scenario. If I wasn't ready to cope with having PCs possessed or worse at this stage in the game, I wouldn't have put that on the table in the first place.</p>

                            I think some additional techniques in the Mage game would have eased the transition into those stakes / that outcome, but I still feel that in any game, it's still important ot buy into what may happen. I'm actually curious to see what will happen in my _Dogs_ game when someone inevitably escalates too far / takes too much Fallout, and the character dies - the character's have been lucky so far, but it's a matter of time. The system gives lots of control to players about when to risk mortality, and as GM I'm reminding people to "deescalate now or forever hold your peace", but any player needs to actually interalize those possible outcomes. Right?                        </div>

                            Dev, <br/><br/>Yes. And the Mage game's situation sounds like it would have irked me. But then participationism irks me, so this is no shock. <br/><br/>Being able to move past the bump and keep playing, and even coming to enjoy what happened, is a good skill to have. But if you do it uncritically, do it when you are being kicked about, and most importantly do it because you have no ability to "put the brakes on and discuss with your group what's going on" in a way that has the potential to change the game, then its just a skill used to cope with dysfunction. <br/><br/>So it's one of those odd little double sided fuckaducks. If you don't go along with something you helped set up and said you were okay* with, you're being a bone-head. If you do go along with something you didn't set up and is really not okay with you, you're being a bone-head. <br/><br/>Josh, <br/><br/>My kicker or GM's bang (we'll assume good Nar GMing for the moment, I guess), makes little difference to me, to be honest. <br/><br/>What I need, one way or another, is enough emotional backgrounding to the scene that I feel the tension of the scene -- rather than just knowing logically that the tension is there. So if I'm in the midst of investigating a crime and say that I go to question Fat Paullie, and you start the next scene with Fat Paullie hanging from his heals as I have to question whether to torture him or not, that's cool. OTOH, if you just start the game with Fat Paullie hanging and tell me that I'm in the middle of an investigation (or even if I set it up that I was in my kicker) I'd be out of sorts because I'm not interested in the question until I'm invested in the situation -- and my investment comes from feeling it, not from thinking it. <br/><br/>Thus, the comments about the F/T split. Folks who T are often just fine jumping into the middle, because all they need is the knowledge of the situation to get their investment on. Folks who are F, however, have a tendancy to need the build up in order to get invested. It's like Emily's comment about how she didn't like the start of Braveheart because it took forever to get to the conflict, vs my feelings that the first hour of Braveheart is the only good part until he dies. <br/><br/><br/>*And "okay" in this sense can mean, "That's going to hurt like fuck, but damn it could be cool!" or even "Oh fuck, Ben and Josh are confronting me with God! But that kind of intensity is the reason I play."                        </div>

Mechanics with clear stake-setting require players to step up and take a side as to what outcome they want to see, but the flipside is that this assumes that everyone is ready to be engaged in either outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that Cooperative/Competetive rules discussion? What I was thinking throughout was that functional Competitive play requires the above to take place - I can push you as hard as I can on some stakes, if and only if as I know that we're both going to be able to keep rolling with the result of that.                        </div>

                            Dev, <br/><br/>Yes. I agree with all of what you are saying now. <br/><br/>I just wan't clear about it in your first example, because I've seen too many folks in situations that looked like that who "rolled with it" because they didn't have a choice -- which is different than the enlightened self-interest that you're talking about. <br/><br/>So I was just trying to divide one from the other: being okay with something where you have clear stakes and being okay with something where you don't aren't always the same. <br/><br/>And I'm nit-picky that way.                        </div>
