The ruleset was Lab Lord AEC.</p><p>We were exploring a dungeon and came across a sealed room that was hard to get into. Inside was a covered object. We felt underneat but didn\u2019t look and it felt like glass. We thought this is probably a super dangerous magic mirror that will zap everyone that looks into it. Like, we didn\u2019t really have much to go on, except the fact that it was covered and that the room was sealed (I don\u2019t remember fully but I think we had to saw through some bars to get there). It could just as easily have been some sort of scrying glass.</p><p>We tied it to our cart and waaaay later, on our way home, we were attacked by some sort of toad like creatures. We revealed the mirror to them \u2014 for it was a mirror \u2014 and one of them dissappeared in a <em>pop</em> like a soap bubble bursting, and the mirror cracked from side to side. SO AWESOME.</p><p>The tension of us caaaarefully trying to examine that glass surface standing under heavy velvet and then the payoff of our care and decisions was something that profoundly shook me. <em>It felt so real.</em></p><p>At this time, as a game master, I was running games in a <em>very</em> improvisational style. I would\u2019ve come up with the velvet covered object without holding to any idea of what was under there. As they felt there, I would\u2019ve come up with it being a glassy surface that they felt. As I heard them speculate that it was a mirror, and heard them being afraid of it having magical or dangerous properties, I would add (or contradict) such properties with the purpose of creating the most tension/payoff/arcs etc. \u2190 This has been one of the biggest straw misunderstandings when discussing my mirror story experience here on S-G \u2014 the naysayers have sometimes said that they would\u2019ve committed to the mirror\u2019s properties as the characters entered the room. Sure, that\u2019s great. But at the time I was more improvisational than that, I was going second by second, not room by room.</p><p>I asked the DM if he had made that mirror up on the spot but he said that it was from the module. And years later I bought the same module, looked it up and yes, there it was.</p><p>The amount of agency and presence and tangibility I felt in that moment, I had never felt before. I\u2019ve felt it many times since because I now play in this sort of game as much as I can and aim for it when running. That\u2019s why I play OSR.</p><p>The merits of the \u201cimprovising the mirror\u2019s properties\u201d style and of the \u201ccommitted to the mirror\u2019s properties\u201d style for various group\u2019s expectations have been brought up in this thread: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">Four mirror scenarios and two groups - Story Games</a></p><p>When I started learning about roleplaying games I was seeing three styles. Railroading a story didn\u2019t appeal to me and everytime I tried it it obviously chafed and broke down. Building the entire world seemed completely impossible. So what was left was improvising, which I learned to do. I was improvising in a way that didn\u2019t really build on the other people\u2019s contributions, I was into rules-light games where I could determine the consequences of any action on my own to steer what was going on. I.e. zero agency. I then after a decade of this started kicking around with story games, Fiasco etc.</p><p>But with the OSR came for me <em>practical</em> methods of prepping a world, or at least enough of a playground to do some cool things in. (Basically map + key + encounter table + improvise the rest \u2014 improvisation to <em>add</em> color to the prep, not <em>replace</em> the prep.) I had read hundreds of games but I had never read B/X or BECMI or any pre 3e D&amp;D game until the OSR happened. Dark Dungeons was the first game I read but actually <em>playing</em> a couple of games was what led to this mirror story Damascus-road-moment. One game of B4 using BECMI that was an <em>awesome</em> session, a lot of actual tangibility there too, and then the next session was another module and we were using LL-AEC and the mirror story happened and it blew my mind.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473100/#Comment_473100" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T08:40:23+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  8:40AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2018 8:43AM by Johann.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh! Thanks for the shout-out, Paul. The blog is long defunct, but the campaign I started at the time is still going strong and has been true to my blog's motto "Out for Blood". <br/><br/>(There\u2019s a campaign log at <a href="http://inforblood1.blogspot.de" rel="nofollow">inforblood1.blogspot.de</a> but it\u2019s in German.)<br/> <br/>I suspect that Sarah and I may be after the same thing: <b>a game of consequences</b>, where the players' choices and luck really matter (and not just as fodder for - or, more positively, contributions to - the GM's improvisation).<br/> <br/>However, <b>I remain somewhat obsessed with character death</b> because to me, it <i>proves</i> (to me, to my players) that we are playing a game of consequences.<br/> <br/>It's all well and good if the players' clever plan leads to great success \u2026 but that could theoretically be orchestrated by the GM (i.e. H =&gt; D, in the case of the mirror example).<br/> <br/>When <i>bad</i> things happen \u2013 i.e. things which suck for the participants, which are not enjoyable at the table --, <i>that's</i> when everyone knows the risks are real. And to me that\u2019s part and parcel of the OSR style (just like playing volleyball: I don\u2019t like botching a crucial serve-receive and my team losing, but without theses failures there\u2019d be no game).<br/> <br/>I know <b>no substitute for the death of characters</b> in the context of D&amp;D.<br/> <br/>After decades of illusionist play I work hard to build and maintain a legitimate OSR style game (or \u201ckiller DM\u201d game, if you prefer and OSR means different things to you), and its <b>legitimacy is affirmed by blood and more blood</b>:<br/><br/>The campaign is approaching 100 sessions and has seen scores of PC deaths. Still, I felt that its legitimacy was deepened when (1) a bunch of beloved high-level characters died last year and (2) when we had our second TPK (at mid-levels, the first one was a DCC level 0 funnel and hardly counts) only a few weeks ago. <br/><br/>(Now we need a "TPK due to an atrociously overpowered random wilderness encounter". Not "Rocks fall, everyone dies.", but close. Fortunately, AD&amp;D's random encounter tables seem eager to oblige. Sea-travel is especially promising. A kraken or ghost ship should do the trick.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473101/#Comment_473101" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T08:50:38+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  8:50AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said.

Usually their criticism of D&amp;D ( and RPGs generally, since that's the one they kinda-sorta know) centers around just how lightweight/flabby the gamism is in them.<br/><br/>For the grognards who did adopt D&amp;D ( and other rpgs), the trend seems to have been the fact that it was lighter weight gamism than "proper" wargames. They were an alternative to Hard Core Gamism, and a desirable one at that. ( The terms <i>Beer n Pretzels, One Brain Cell,  Just for a laugh with your mates </i> are common in discussions of lightweight wargaming, and the people I spoke with seemed to toss RPGs in the same pile as other games with those descriptions).<br/><br/>I only mention these things because this thread and others I've seen in a similar vein seem to be almost praising not just an OSR, but a sort of radical, fundamentalist OISR approach to Gamism.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>I guess that all just seems odd to me, having been there for part of the evolution in RPGs and RPG playstyles.<br/><br/>I remember video games where you got 3 lives for your $0.25, and when they were gone you were dead and had to start over, from the beginning, paying another coin.<br/><br/>Then they added a free life for certain goals being accomplished, adding another coin at the point your last man was killed to continue from that point on, pause buttons and save points on console and PC games, making it all a great deal less frustrating and, arguably, a lot softer of a form of gamism.<br/><br/>It seems as if RPGs have likewise gotten softer in their gamism, and likely for similar reasons.

The OSR is a reaction in that sense, and like many counter-movements, it is prone to overcompensation and stressing differences.<br/><br/>My own fundamentalism is no doubt a reaction to illusionism. I think if I play this way long enough, the need to affirm legitimacy/hardcore-ness etc. may pass. As Eero points out, character death is still necessary as a loss condition, but perhaps I will be happy with easier games with fewer deaths, too (having established that death is indeed on the table, however unlikely).<br/><br/>Also, it seems to me as if Gygax drifted towards illusionism ("A DM only rolls the dice because of the noise they make."), which would of course make him less hardcore, particularly to a wargamer, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473113/#Comment_473113" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T13:08:01+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  1:08PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2018 1:10PM by komradebob.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, it seems to me as if Gygax drifted towards illusionism ("A DM only rolls the dice because of the noise they make."), which would of course make him less hardcore, particularly to a wargamer, right?</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm not sure about illusionism in that case exactly.<br/><br/>But soft core gamism? Sure. I've heard ( and I don't have  a reference link for this sadly) that Gygax commonly stated PCs at 3rd level in his home games.<br/><br/>That's soft core gamist tendencies showing up right there. So are things like allowing 4d6 drop lowest, or choices of stat arrangement.  Things like  moving away from a simple Zero Hit Points = Death, to all of the more convoluted negative hit point schemes. They certainly seem like a slide away from hard core gamism, rapidly, by the very guy most associated with early D&amp;D.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473114/#Comment_473114" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T13:11:14+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  1:11PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do any of you feel you're approaching OSR gaming with a more Hardcore Gamist attitude than the actual, original players of early D&amp;D?</p></div></blockquote>\nI think so, yeah. To be specific: "original players" is such a vague and disparate crowd that I'm sure that you can point to all sorts of "more original than you" people with all kinds of imaginable play styles. Despite that, I cannot imagine even a plurality of the players having been as "hardcore" about it as I am myself. The majority probably were playing with gamist understanding during the '70s, yes, but they were also constantly inventing and trying new things, some of which point the way towards entirely different play priorities. Some started with those priorities, clearly.<br/><br/>I'll also note that I do not personally care about the historical authenticity thing. I understand that it's really, really important to many people, of whom some are old D&amp;D players and some are current; it is, in a way, much more important than any actual, practical play. But that's not the case for me, I just don't have the baggage that makes "being real D&amp;D" somehow desirable. As one might imagine, I find it sometimes frustrating how much people care about faithfulness to how some other guy might have played 30 years ago, as opposed to trying to play well <i>now</i>.<br/><br/>As for real wargaming, I can see both sides: D&amp;D is very <i>different</i> from the mainstream thinking in wargames, and it does discard some things, but I also think that it's revolutionary in a way that is genuine to some of the most admirable creative goals that wargaming has. The best instances of D&amp;D boldly discard impersonal chit-counting in favour of a much, much broader fidelity to real concerns of war. I am aware of few wargames that even attempt to give the players such a broad and flexible playing field in terms of humanist concerns (psychology, sociology, history, economy...). If your ideal in wargaming is to step beyond mechanistical boardgames and capture a real philosophy of war (or dynamic systems in general, really - that term should be interpreted very broadly in this context), then the approach D&amp;D takes cannot be ignored. If you want a more complex Chess, then D&amp;D is obviously not your cup of tea.<br/><br/>(I have nothing against a more complex Chess, by the way - I play plenty of boardgames and the heavier variety of computer games. I just think that wargaming as an idea is at its most powerful when you're not satisfied with your game merely having the <i>color</i> of Napoleon - I want the game to <i>address</i> Napoleon, to teach and illuminate on human condition. This means a real connection to humanistic disciplines, not just a neat set of rules where you call one type of playing piece "artillery".)<br/><br/>I do think that D&amp;D could perhaps have presented itself in a less marketable and more high-brow way to begin with. I suspect that much of the early disdain for the game was because of its superficially frivolous subject matter. Classical wargamers value historical scholarship a great deal, so a game that bases itself more on fictional fantasy tales will naturally be viewed as a casual joke. Roleplaying culture has repeated the same sorts of prejudices often when a game has stepped outside the traditionally respected subject matters. I wonder how D&amp;D would have been received by traditional wargamers if it told about a "serious" topic like say Spanish conquistadors during the age of exploration. Less popular overall seems like a given in hindsight, but what about the reaction from the pre-existing wargamer base... perhaps we could have seen a more connected culture that perceived wargaming and roleplaying as the same hobby. It would surely have been a benefit to the development of wargaming, we can claim in hindsight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473115/#Comment_473115" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T13:27:39+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  1:27PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like the real crux of D&amp;D, and I am speculating with really little to back it up, comes from how easy it was to break coming at it from a "bespoke" wargame model...there's only so much "critical examination" you can do of dungeon fantasy as a tactical exercise before you start to get diminishing returns on it.

I don't think that it's as simple as that.<br/><br/>I have played old video games quite a bit over the years, all sorts, and classic arcade style games with high score tables and quick gameplay are certainly natural to play in a gamist context: I want to better my skills, improve my score and if not brag to friends, then at least have the satisfaction of mastery.<br/><br/>You capture the development well, though: the addition of all sorts of softening features draws the nature of the video game further and further towards it being an <i>activity</i> or <i>experience</i> rather than a challenge. Ultimately, at the end of the road, we have the modern video game: roughly 40 hours of activity to be experienced, feel free to fine-tune the difficulty level so it keeps you awake but doesn't impede progress. I think we can agree that at some point between <i>Gradius</i> and <i>Bioshock</i> (to pick two arbitrary shooting games) there's a moment where "learning to be good" is replaced by "I want to experience playing this" as an agenda. I mean, sure, a "softer gamism" does exist, but I think much of what gets interpreted that way is actually Simulationism, you know.<br/><br/>Relating this to roleplaying games, you might remember how I wrote about D&amp;D 4th edition a bit a couple months back. Many would perceive and interpret 4th edition as precisely the sort of soft gamism as you suggested. I think that it feels more like Sim to me, though. I can't distinguish between playing 4th edition D&amp;D and Dragonlance, and neither can I distinguish Dragonlance from Call of Cthulhu - it's all the same sort of Bioshock-type game-for-the-sake-of-experience to me.<br/><br/>To bring that back to the topic: I have read early texts from Gary Gygax that are very "pure" in terms of meaningful challengeful wargaming. <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i> is an excellent example. I have also read increasingly equivocating and "impure" texts from him, ending up with late-era stuff that advocates for auteuristic Simulationism more than anything else. I haven't made a careful study of the matter, so don't bite my head off, but it seems to me that his rpg philosophy simply shifted over time: he started from a hardcore gamist position in the early '70s, but already in the DMG he's softcore at best, and he does follow the scene's mainstream into what becomes traditional gaming through the '80s. This is in no way exceptional, the same seems to have happened to many old-timers as they developed the possibilities of roleplaying games: it seems to me that many simply didn't care for the wargamey type of game as much as the newer possibilities. Just because you start with wargaming when it's the only game in town doesn't mean that you have to stick with it your entire life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473117/#Comment_473117" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T13:38:55+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  1:38PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a> <br/>I was there in the late seventies--a teenager doing wargames (counter &amp; hex-board games, about 1976, and minatures starting, about 1980) and playing D&amp;D starting around 1978 with a friend and then a year later in a bunch of different groups.

Heavy on crime-solving, perhaps, but there's plenty of room for brawling sort of action, heavy takedowns of violent perps and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473202/#Comment_473202" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-03T12:52:16+00:00" title="May  3, 2018 12:52PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2018 12:58PM by komradebob.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero:<br/><br/>Yes, I suspect that a move from Hard Core Gamism &gt; Softcore Gamism &gt; Simulationism &gt; Really Softcore Genre Emulation is a fairly common trajectory for games and game players.<br/><br/>I suspect some of that is because very few types of games exist that provide that options.

Yeah, I definitely think so: you're not playing a rules system, you're playing a world simulation. 4th edition D&amp;D is a different sort of thing, and not "really D&amp;D" in the sense of being the same game that the original is.<br/><br/>4th edition is probably the worst possible version of D&amp;D to play if you want to play in an old-school style.

Rather, it is that I have no true respect for the type of challenge it offers: if I'm not interested in performing at high level, beating others and self-identifying as a master in it, then it is difficult for me to have a gamist attitude about it.<br/><br/>As for why this is, I think Sandra's got the gist of it: 4th is pretty typical as a nerd game in that it's got a simple core mechanic, a considerable amount of randomness, and large expanses of mechanical minutia. I don't want to say that it's stupid to rise to challenge when faced with something like that, but for me it's mainly just disconnected busywork. I am not intrigued by the idea of "proving system mastery" by poring over hundreds of pages of rpg manuals (even worse if I was buying them myself) to pick up bonus feats for a one-trick character build. That's not skill or even daring, it's just patience. There's no real core conundrum to 4th edition D&amp;D, your success or failure depends on actuarial optimization.<br/><br/>(I'll note that many, many games in geek culture work on the premise that you should be celebrated as a skilled player thanks to having more patience for it than the average simian. I encourage everybody to stop and think at times about this: does this activity really have some sort of admirable skill component, or is it just that I have an edge because I've memorized all 550 Pokemon?)<br/><br/>In comparison, old school D&amp;D is a wholly different beast: it asks us to develop exploration and commando raid procedures, and prove them functional in simulated conditions. As the game expands with strategic concerns, it branches out to many interesting topics that tie to all branches of the sciences and humanities. It is intellectually invigorating, and mastering it as best I can, even with all its chaotic elements, seems like an interesting challenge and an admirable skill.<br/><br/>That being said, I have been thinking about playing 4th edition as a challengeful gamist game for years. Here's what I've got so far on that front:<br/><br/>Instead of having the GM balance the encounters, ask the players to participate in setting up the combat encounters with a variety of advance knowledge and methods of influencing what it'll be like. Fix the loss condition so it's actually manageable to lose. Reward victory in meaningful ways. Make passing on an encounter (because the players consider it too dangerous or unnecessary) a functional option.<br/><br/>I can go into details on how one would do those things, but the core concept should be clear: the challenge in 4th edition D&amp;D should, perhaps, be about rational risk-taking and correctly projecting combat outcomes. The game should not be asking the players the trivial question of "how can I pile more bonuses on my combat combo?", but rather: "How many of these orcs, for whom I have a mostly perfect stat block here, can our party take?" "All things considered, do we dare go against five? Six? Seven? Where's our limit?"<br/><br/>I hope it's clear why I would consider that a much more interesting question than "What's the most optimal build I can make in this game?" Note how the question about predicting combat outcomes and therefore understanding the mechanical process of the game doesn't predicate on character min-maxing: we can very well create all sorts of characters, weak and strong, and still explore the limits of their combat performance. Instead of trying to make characters for whom the GM's encounters are trivial, we make encounters that are difficult to gauge and interesting to play through to find out whether taking on that encounter was a smart move in the first place.<br/><br/>The by-the-book process of 4th edition, with its encounter balance budget and players using a pile of sourcebooks to construct characters, that game's best fit for simmy princess play of the sort I've described before. That is its entire reason of existence: we want a game where we can set up some miniatures, roll the dice, and at the end my character's going to blow the enemy away with his special move (which doesn't need to be objectively that special; the game tries its best to make sure any Daily I choose will be good enough). If this sequence of events does not happen, it's a huge problem for the game for all the reasons that have been discussed before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473283/#Comment_473283" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T09:23:16+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  9:23AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I just used the word "legit" in my remark as a shorthand for "appropriate for challenge-oriented old school wargame D&amp;D".

I am not intrigued by the idea of "proving system mastery" by poring over hundreds of pages of rpg manuals (even worse if I was buying them myself) to pick up bonus feats for a one-trick character build.

If the players didn't rip the GM apart and destroy the game the moment he shows any weakness, there wouldn't be such great necessity for limiting the game to the GM's limited understanding of the world.<br/><br/>That is to say, my solution to the GM expertise issue is very much to foster a culture of play where there is no taboo for the GM to say it when he's beyond his depth, and for the other players to tell him when they know something better than he does. This practice opens up dialogues on important real issues that the game touches upon, which is actually a major reason to play the game at all.<br/><br/>As a practical example on what I mean, I used to for the longest time over-estimate the amount of time that a skilled archer needs to set up a shot and fire. This wasn't because I didn't understand the mechanics of shooting or hadn't ever handled a bow - it was simply because I'd never accounted for the fact that you don't need nearly as much time to shoot a bow when you're shooting at close ranges; much of the time we spend while taking a shot is taken up by aiming in conventional bow-shooting competitions and such. In other words: you can totally shoot a bow "from the hip", and it's demonstrably a possible combat technique. (If you're interested in that issue in more depth, I recommend checking out some Youtube videos of what bow hobbyists get up to - might be illuminating.)<br/><br/>So I had this misconception, and it influenced the rules and procedures and rulings I used in D&amp;D. One of the people I play with called me on it and educated me on the issue. This didn't happen in play - we actually didn't live in the same area at the time, even - but it might as well have. It's a big and complex enough issue that we wouldn't hash it out to any finality at the gaming table, but as I've often described, you'd make a compromise judgement on the spot and then figure it out afterwards. Either way, we did the legwork on demonstrating what's possible (and historically likely, and realistically feasible, etc.) and that ended up with me changing my combat rules to account for close quarters bow fighting.<br/><br/>Anyway, I found that pretty interesting - I learned something new about archery then, directly inspired by actual play and contributions of a player who had a better handle on it.<br/><br/>This is not to say that it's not beneficial for the GM to be a strong, confident scholar with a thirst for knowledge and a solid base - all of that is of course a great help in simply being interested in running the game at all. I mean, I don't run a D&amp;D campaign because I'm lonely or bored or something like that, there are many things we could be doing instead. I <i>specifically</i> enjoy the varied intellectual aspects of the game, which is what makes it feasible for me to be a pretty fair GM. I don't think that there is some specific minimum knowledge level that a GM needs to have, but they do need to be curious people who enjoy figuring things out and building consistent procedures.<br/><br/>If I had to guess, the reason why GMs are so scared about being challenged at the game table is because they don't have the social and intellectual tools for handling a challenge in a positive way. If you've only ever thought about a challenge as something to be afraid of, then you might not be able to smile and thank another player when they correct you on something. This is simply flat out wrong, you're being a bad GM if you react this way when another player <i>deigns</i> to be an active and interested participant.

I've played most of the official campaign (H1 to E2) and a series of brutal skirmish scenarios with a bunch of other <i>dedicated</i> simians. ;-) I poured around 50 hours into optimizing my character (studying char op forums, poring over the books and expansions, using Excel to calculate DPR etc.). I was gratified to find that I got returns for every hour invested - diminishing ones, of course - even after dozens of hours.<br/><br/>(I totally understand Eero's disdain for this sort of thing. But even though I've soured on the char op thing and other aspects of 4e, I do have fond memories. Recalling how (and how often) the DM threw up his hands in despair still brings a smile to my face, albeit a somewhat guilty one.) <br/><br/>What's missing, though, was an appropriate challenge on the battlefield. In the absence of such a challenge, the game <i>of course</i> turned towards seeing whose character shone the brightest, i.e. could perform the most impressive smack-downs, humiliating stun-locks etc.<br/><br/>The modules were far too easy and we were not radical enough in ramping up the difficulty (by expanding the DM's budget, leveling up more slowly etc.) As Eero suggests, the game needs some mechanism for the <i>players</i> to decide how much they <i>dare</i> tackle.<br/><br/>(And I agree that a decent loss condition would be required, too. As I wrote on the blog mentioned above, character death is not feasible when the characters are like a Magic: the Gathering deck, which you'd want to further optimize after a loss, not discard).<br/><br/>I think 4e might be salvageable in this context if the challenge were hard enough to have massive character optimization as a baseline assumption, leaving <i>only</i> party optimization (i.e. synergies between builds) and tactical optimization on the battlefield (as Shimrod suggests) as a road to victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473291/#Comment_473291" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T11:28:11+00:00" title="May  4, 2018 11:28AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you've only ever thought about a challenge as something to be afraid of, then you might not be able to smile and thank another player when they correct you on something.

That is to say: GMs get caught up in infantile interactions with players first and foremost because they set the bar low and expect the worst of everybody, and generally treat players like children. The players pick up on this and, over time, start behaving like children: they try to get away with things and put one over the GM because they're not asked to contribute and take responsibility at a higher level.<br/><br/>This is why my "D&amp;D pedagogy" (the way I interact at a table through a campaign to influence how others play) is so relatively hands-off: I try to make sure that we get <i>exactly</i> as good play as we deserve to get, on the basis of everybody's contributions. If you play a shallow game, you get a shallow game, and the GM will not do the legwork to entertain you at a higher level if you don't contribute yourself. If you play well, you are creatively rewarded with support and excitement. Over time we gravitate towards the kind of game the play group is capable and motivated to play; not the dream game the GM might speculate about, but the real game this group of people here can make.<br/><br/>A minor yet radical example of what I mean would be the way I handle character equipment. Check this out:<br/><b>*</b> In chargen I tell the players to either roll a conventional budget and buy their equipment, or to "just give the character what is reasonable in the setting and character backstory; you can ask me and the other long-timers if you're uncertain about something. Remember that 13th century Sweden doesn't have plate mail as D&amp;D understands it."<br/><b>*</b> When characters buy equipment, there are no equipment lists. Instead, the players ask the GM for price points (from local merchants, in the fictional position the purchase occurs in), which the GM delivers on the basis of his economical simulation of the moment. The players can run their own models and argue for different prices out of character, or they can haggle in-character - it's all good, we're doing price discovery to figure out what stuff costs in this setting.<br/><b>*</b> Once the players get a hang of pricing, I generally let them sell stuff to each other. They know what it cost the last time they bought it themselves, and they can do demand-based corrections and such just fine if you ask them to.<br/><br/>The overall point of doing equipment purchase in that way is to a) get rid of the sucky equipment lists that come with D&amp;D texts, and b) invite everybody to enjoy the economic model the GM runs throughout a campaign. It's simply interesting to figure out how expensive e.g. chain mail or a sword or a horse should be in a given setting, on the basis of what we know about it. It's interesting to build your character's strategic and tactical play on the basis of the campaign economy, which ultimately determines whether you have access to henchmen or burning oil or armor or carpentry tools or whatnot. All this then contributes ultimately to your dungeoneering doctrine and tactical goal-setting. In this way play in Carcosa <i>really is</i> different from play in medieval Sweden, in a way that was never truly realized by late-era TSR setting products. Whether <i>Dark Sun</i> or <i>Planescape</i>, it's always gonna be a 3rd level Fighter hitting an orc with a sword, and that's the game if you let it become that.<br/><br/>So anyway, my point: after adopting this type of pedagogical approach I've found that the players are on average not nearly as much of cheating whiners as we generally think of them. The vast majority will do their best when you ask them to, and their best is generally speaking everything we could hope and desire for in a game like this - as I mentioned earlier, there's no minimum skill level, everybody can contribute. If not by teaching, then by learning.<br/><br/>Adult players won't generally even <i>try</i> to make bare-faced judgements in their own favour. Children will try it just to see what happens, but when I've asked these players whether they really think that their judgement is fair, they will quickly admit it when it isn't. Sometimes we genuinely disagree on something, and I will as a matter of principle give way.

That goes for all aspects of play, really; although I value my accomplishment in getting a Magic-User to 3rd level at a very legit table (my best achievement as a character player - and the character's still alive, too!), the real pride for me is in the purity of method, depth of the campaign and high quality of the substantial issues in our play. These are all achievements that are developed long term, and not dependant on a single event in a single session of play. I value the skill more than the result.<br/><br/>Something that goes for this style of play, but also many other types of role-playing, though: I think that people tend to worry too much about objective truthiness of their stuff, rather than enjoying the fact that their process is good. For example, I see this a lot when discussing historical settings in roleplaying games: many people are hesitant of playing in a historical milieu because they "won't get it right". There's an underlying assumption there that somebody somewhere <i>could</i> "get it right" in some authorial "real historian" sense. I like to try to convince people of an alternate viewpoint: that it's not about how correct you are, but rather about <i>being correct enough to play meaningfully</i>.<br/><br/>Old school D&amp;D, for instance, requires the exact same level of historical realism as a multitude of serious drama games do: you need to give it your best effort as a group, and that's that. If you're playing with teenagers and something like say the game's economics or understanding of medieval gender roles is objectively pretty simplistic, that does not actually break the game. It would be a problem if some of the players in the group knew better, but if it's the best level the group can achieve, how would they have any trouble with it? As far as they know, it's good enough.<br/><br/>I'd like to emphasize that I do not disdain light-hearted topics and themes in D&amp;D, or focused games that intentionally set certain facets of human experience aside. Your game doesn't need to be an extremely reality-based all-around universal sandbox to have nobility. I just think that whatever the actual subject matter of the campaign, that part should be tackled with a honest wargaming process, rather than e.g. forcing the GM's preconceptions on it.<br/><br/>This means that if you're not comfortable or interested in the minutiae of medieval history or realistic world-building, why not play a dungeon game focused on skirmish tactics? Or vice versa. Pick your subject matter and game it out to learn how it works, that's at the heart of wargaming as I understand it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473328/#Comment_473328" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T18:47:36+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  6:47PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Right, the glue&amp;tripwires was other tangibility but there are similarities...<br/><br/>The feeling of going up to a cloth-covered object, which could be anything, and feeling under it... and then tying it to our cart <i>unseen</i>...<br/><br/>But OK, Perkins has a similar to the mirror story in 4e when the players took a living ballista and made it their weapon.

I was a long-term 4E DM and ran the game regularly for several years, including multiple one-shots introducing newcomers to the hobby, from about 2008 to 2011 or so (when I switched to 13th Age when its playtest began). <br/><br/>I feel the "weird things" you describe here are very overtly encouraged in the play culture and advice described in both of 4E's DMGs, but especially in the DMG2. Quite frankly, virtually all of the overt criticism of 4E I have come across online seems to me to be a product of basically ignoring its DMG advice and assuming "I already know how to run D&amp;D" with, quite frankly, predictable consequences. Although, I would also add to that I felt many writing at WotC did not understand the system all that well and almost all of its written modules were pretty terrible at exploiting the strengths of the system (with the first one Keep on the Shadowfell being notoriously not-that-well-written).<br/><br/>At the very least, as a novice DM I felt that 4E equipped me with the tools to adjudicate the weird things in a straightforward and sensible way and encouraged, at least in our home games, a social environment of "say yes to the players" at every possible angle.<br/><br/>That said, I would agree the player-facing side of the rulebooks did not as good of a job communicating many of these things as the DM-facing side. <br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473333/#Comment_473333" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T19:07:05+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  7:07PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my complaints about 4e fall away as I look at things later in the product line.

And then only the <i>effect</i> is canned, not the action. I plead with my patron (the fay queen Chantarelle) for her mystical power and she is cruel in return. Questing for diamonds for the revivify spell was a big part of my corsair council campaign.<br/><br/>It makes sense to me that the eldritch arts are formalized, ritualized, canned, whereas no amount of katas and rotes can capture the chaos of the battlefield. But as with much in the realms of aesthetics it's subjective.<br/><br/>Like, for me there's a huge difference between a ranger going "Time for my Careful Attack\u2122" vs "ok I send out my mage hand to feel the lever... does it move?". And obviously there was a spectrum in 4e groups, some refering to the power names, some saying "I attack it carefully" and some saying "I Attack it Carefully wink wink". 4e worked well for many people. And again, it does some things better than any other game.<br/><br/>I was happy to see the ranger and fighter get <i>some</i> spells in 5e. For example, Hunter's Mark is now a spell.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>but the Fighter can only do "cool stunts" by GM fiat.</p></div></blockquote>\nI was glad to see the 5e fighter maneuver list have a strong separation of action and effect. They give you more <i>effects</i> to invoke but the action is yours. Like, everyone in 5e can attempt to disarm, and the mechanic is similar (your attack roll vs their strength roll) but when you spend a superiority die to do so, you:<br/><br/>1. save an action in the action econ since you can deal damage and disarm simultaneously<br/>2. deal more damage<br/>3. have a slightly higher chance of succeeding with the disarming (since they need to roll strength save, wereas normal disarming they need to roll athlobatics, often higher)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>OSR

Still, its an understandable sentiment in the RPG culture writ large although I'd argue its rooted more in an unexamined Appeal To Tradition than to any concerns for verisimilitude.<br/><br/>Stylistic preferences aside, I personally observed the difference in player agency for my Fighter's player when we switched from 4E (with its AEDU structure) to 13th Age (with its flexible attack structure). I made pretty liberal use of Rule 42 and Always Say Yes in both games, nothing in particular changed there. So, its not like taking away the "cool powers" caused the players to rely more on fictional positioning than they did before --- the Fighters just had less agency than the Wizards when we stopped playing 4E. And there was an even greater discrepancy in agency in the 5E games I've played and run.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473365/#Comment_473365" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-05T04:27:43+00:00" title="May  5, 2018  4:27AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2018 4:54AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I weakened my case by sounding like I was appealing to realism with my mage hands pulling levers and my appeals to my Fay Queen and my careful management of somatic components.

Just like how Adventure System changed \u201cCareful Attack\u201d to \u201cSword\u201d, \u201cTwin Shot\u201d to \u201cBow\u201d.</p><p>As an analogy, I felt it was an improvement when some versions of Fate Accelerated Edition went from approaches to abilities. Same mechanics, different feel. Applying in a different \u201clayer\u201d of play.</p><p>Since I\u2019m no 4e master I\u2019d best remain humble about the relative merits of different numbers of, and execution of, fighter powers. (I have a simple heart and really love playing the champion in 5e so it was heartbreaking to see it out-DPR:ed by the battlemaster \u2013 out-controlled would\u2019ve been fine.) Instead, my case is built on the name and presentation of any such powers.</p><dl><dt>Cleave, Reaping Strike, Sure Strike</dt><dd><p>I guess these are OK. The fact that you get this at level 1 is good because that makes it more like feeling that everyone can cleave, everyone can be careful. It was a bit jarring listening to 4e play and hearing \u201cCleave\u201d, \u201cCleave\u201d, \u201cCleave\u201d instead of \u201cattack\u201d, \u201cattack\u201d, \u201cattack\u201d.</p><p>Flavor texts on these are \u201cso close but yet so far\u201d to me. I don\u2019t like that they tell a little story about what I do. I wanted them to be more matter of factly but diegetic. \u201cTrade power for precision\u201d (without the first word) for Sure Strike would\u2019ve been better, same for Cleave. Reaping Strike\u2019s flavor text is the biggest culprit here.</p><p>Already we have three powers that all overshadow a basic attack. To me, it feels like it limits you, to go \u201cSure Strike, Sure Strike, Cleave\u201d instead of a more direct and heavy feel of sword in hand.</p></dd><dt>Tide of Iron</dt><dd>\u201cShield Push\u201d would\u2019ve been a name I would\u2019ve liked better, and I don\u2019t like the flavor text on this either.</dd></dl><p>I guess a good example of what I consider an improvement is how 4e\u2019s Healing Strike was changed into 5e\u2019s Healing Word, a spell that also lets you attack in the same turn.

That's understandable and I agree to a certain extent (for example, I think using the term "powers" and "squares" was VERY poorly thought-out). Although, I'd qualify that by adding I personally like stuff like Tide of Iron and find it much more evocative and inspiring than things like Shield Push. In much the same way I prefer an AW Gunlugger's Not To Be Fucked With vs a more generic sounding move like, say, Expert Combatant.<br/><br/>(Also, not to quibble, but Healing Word is in 4E, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473389/#Comment_473389" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-05T16:19:54+00:00" title="May  5, 2018  4:19PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Like, instead of having rules for how to hit an enemy\u2019s leg so that they are slowed (which 5e doesn\u2019t even have (among the general fighting actions, unlike shoving someone prone, disarming them, grappling them etc)), they just weave that into the Steel Serpent Strike power.

The DMG2 even expanded upon these with the introduction of Terrain Powers. To my knowledge, there is nothing comparable in any version of D&amp;D for which I am familiar (albeit my knowledge of the older editions is somewhat lacking).<br/><br/>As a 4E DM, I could easily adjudicate "how to hit an enemy's leg so they are slowed" without invoking any class powers, just by following the procedures on Page 42. Str or Dex vs Fort: on a hit, they enemy is slowed until the end of your next turn. Depending on the fictional positioning of the attacker's actions, I might also add some level-based damage expression on top of that (also found on Page 42) or increase the duration to save ends. 5E, incidentally, make it much harder to adjudicate things like this because it replaced static defenses with ability saves and also has pretty vague guidelines for how much damage a given character should do.<br/><br/>(...now, this doesn't even get into that there are a lot of really cool martial powers in 4E that would be difficult to replicate using any kind of general rule like Rule 42. My 9th level Fighter could, once a day, shift 3 paces make an attack, shift 3 paces make another attack, and shift 1 pace and make a third attack. 5E martial characters can't do anything remotely comparable to martial dailies in 4E and THAT'S what I mean by the loss of player agency here.)<br/><br/>This isn't an either/or proposition. The existence of a Serpent Strike encounter power does not in any way diminish the existence of Rule 42. 4E has both.<br/><br/>However, as I mentioned in a previous post, 4E did not do a very good job of communicating all this to the player's side. On the DM's side (for those that bothered to read the DMGs) it was crystal clear, however, so it kinda fell on the DM to present and communicate these opportunities to the players.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>And, again, you can keep that mechanic (without addressing that specific complaint \u2013 \u201cno general rule how to attack someone\u2019s leg\u201d \u2013 but maybe that\u2019s worth it for the sake of simplicity; and without addressing the complaint that there\u2019s a lack of clarity in why this particular strike is a limited resource \u2013 but I\u2019m OK with fighters having limited resources to exhaust, it\u2019s just a challenge to flavor that well)</p></div></blockquote>\nMy answer to that is that the at-will, encounter, and daily frequencies in 4E are pacing mechanics, not unlike the action economy, hit points, turns, or dozens of other things in the game. One could just as well ask why my 1st level Fighter can only attack once per round (and only on his turn) or can only make one reaction in a round.<br/><br/>Sure, there are ex post facto fictional explanations for these things ("I only had the opportunity to make one good attack during X amount of time") but these are secondary to their actual design purpose: as pacing mechanics.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In early 4e I am selecting the outcome and then attempt to get that outcome, that script, that little movie to play.</p><p>In Otherkind and Genesys I am given an outcome and then have to narrate and fit the diegetical elements to that outcome.</p><p>Both are resolved the same way, by becoming an author of cool fight scenes about my character, to tweak the narration to make it fit.

A 4E Weaponmaster has to decide before he rolls which maneuver to use, whereas both a 4E Slayer and a 5E Battlemaster gets to declare after their roll whether they use a maneuver or not. To me that's the opposite of the IIEE process you're describing.<br/><br/>Anyways, thanks again.

We've already established this boils down to subjective preferences, so its not like one style of presentation is "better" than the other.<br/><br/>With that being said, however, would you not agree that something like Tide of Iron fits a game that's going for *Big Damn Heroes Doing Cinematic Fantasy Adventure* better than Shield Push does?<br/><br/>(... also, I'd argue that 4E empowers its players by giving them *both* canned stunts *and* opportunities to create their own stunts.

In 4E, the attacker always rolls against a static defense and, on a hit, always gets the effect they were going for. Furthermore, that effect is always going to be one of two standardized durations, either "until the end of your next turn" or "save ends".<br/><br/>In 5E, how you would go about adjudicating the "I use my weapon to slow him down a while" move is not at all clear to me. Do I attack his AC and then he gets a Strength save against a DC we make up on the spot? Do I bypass his AC altogether and we make opposed Strength checks? Either way, its a loser's bet for the attacker because you're reliant on two favorable d20 rolls vs one favorable d20 roll by simply making a regular attack. What about duration? Rounds? Minutes? Until a short rest?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But in this case you\u2019re not after damage, you\u2019re after imposing slowitude.</p></div></blockquote>\nUsing page 42, I'd probably still allow a low damage expression with the maneuver even if slowing the enemy was the primary intention.

Having a set of what you call "canned stunts" in the game is a powerful device for a) setting the tone and color of the game and b) communicating to the players (on both sides of the GM screen) exactly what the game is about and what characters in it should be pursuing in play. To me, the skills and powers in 4E and 13th Age feel *a lot* like basic moves and playbook moves from AW in terms of the function they serve in setting the pace and expectations of the game. <br/><br/>In any case, when this argument is applied to a game in the D&amp;D family I can't help but feel it is an exercise in Appeals to Tradition and Special Pleading. "Canned stunts" are bad when the Fighter does them (martial exploits), but "canned stunts" are good when the Wizard does them (arcane spells). If one were to take the "every last canned stunt in there is an obstacle to the imagination" to its logical conclusion, one would be as equally critical toward the entire edifice of spells in D&amp;D tradition as the edifice of martial powers in games like 4E. If one is not as equally critical of spells as powers, it is suggestive this has less to do with creativity and more to do with familiarity.<br/><br/>Additionally, I would argue a more profound aid to imagination in regards to attempting improvised stunts and the like is a design structure that, if it does not reward the players for trying them, at the very least does not punish them for doing so. This includes not only a) how probable the stunt is to succeed, b) how effective the stunt is likely to be in regards to both mechanical and fictional efficacy, but also c) how durable and resilient player characters are in the chance that the stunt does not work out as intended.<br/><br/>By those three criteria, I would argue 4E is by far the most forgiving edition of D&amp;D of which I am familiar (again with the caveat I am not as well versed in the older editions as I could be) toward attempting and succeeding at improvised actions.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>OK, yeah, this is a good point \u2013 and even if I wouldn\u2019t have a problem adjudicating it, you make a good case that it would be even easier in 4e.<br/><br/>(...)<br/><br/>This part of the argument doesn\u2019t really work that well because the defender is also reliant on favorable rolls. We can go into dice probs some other time, it\u2019d be a side argument. I\u2019ll concede the rest of your point anyway.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe issue is in 4E the attacker only needs to make one successful roll to pull off the stunt. Whereas in 5E (assuming the DM doesn't decide to completely ignore AC and go for opposed ability checks) not only does the attacker have to succeed in beating the defender's AC but the defender *also* has to fail in making his Con save or whatever. That's why I said its a loser's bet: if I need one lucky roll to do damage or two lucky rolls to slow, then doing damage is always my best bet. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This facet of the argument risks opening up a can of worms because while I support reskinning/refluffing on the GM\u2019s side, I think allowing too much of it on the player\u2019s side removes all sense of flavor and identity of the classes and their mechanics.

Which, I suppose, is more a criticism of the Battlemaster's design vis a vis 4E's encounter powers than 5E's approach to stunts as a whole.<br/><br/>You could probably simulate 4E's approach to this sort of thing by making opposed ability checks in 5E... although adding a damage component with the status effect would be a lot trickier in 5E.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And I explained why I felt that way, remember?

The context of this particular issue was the assertion that what you are calling "canned stunts" inhibit a player's inclination to improvise their own stunts. My point here is that if martial "canned stunts" do this, then so do magical "canned stunts" (in other words, spells). How one feels about the fictional relationship between action and effect with the "canned stunt" is, from what I can see, immaterial to this particular issue.<br/><br/>Now, to the point you make here, I must admit you've lost me here. The overwhelming majority of martial powers in 4E are basically "you do a special weapon attack and, if you hit the other guy, you do a bunch of damage plus some kind of status effect". <br/><br/>Could you elucidate what exactly it is you mean by tangling up action and effect? I mean, is this related to the above issue and you just don't like resolving the weapon attack and status infliction with the same d20 roll? I'm just not seeing it.<br/><br/>Have a great afternoon.<br/><br/>~ Trent<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473827/#Comment_473827" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T19:34:28+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  7:34PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contrasting the two examples that have been used, Steel Serpent Strike:<br/><br/>"You stab viciously at your foe\u2019s knee or foot to slow him down.

No matter how quick they are, your foes are at least singed by the blast."<br/><br/>Is that fair, is that what you're thinking of when you say 4E tangles up action and effect?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21628/osr-play-the-draw-a-concise-formulation" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21628/osr-play-the-draw-a-concise-formulation" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21628/osr-play-the-draw-a-concise-formulation/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21628%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21628%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
