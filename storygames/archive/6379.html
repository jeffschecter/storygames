Here's what I decided it means:<br/><br/><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br/><br/>Within the rooftop necropolis lies a Priest-Queen\u2019s ransom in gold and jewels, but the horrific blood mummy isn\u2019t the only guardian.  There are fouler things, and the necropolis has deep secrets all its own.  And plundering the open-air crypt is only half the challenge \u2013 after killing a sacred royal ancestor and looting her tomb, the entire nation of Ingani will be in a fury of pursuit and revenge.  <br/><br/><b>MAGNIFICENT INGANIPURU</b><br/><br/>The Ingani live on a temperate highland surrounded by dense jungle punctuated by high peaks.  Their Priest-Queen rules a modest but prosperous empire of client states that includes agricultural villages, trade centers, and immensely productive mines.  Inganipuru, the capital, is a prosperous city of one hundred thousand, with broad avenues that bisect the city in cardinal directions, intersecting at the grounds of the palace of the Priest-Queen Payquna III.  Each of the four districts contains a marketplace, public buildings, and its own temple complex dedicated to the bewildering array of Ingani Gods.  Unique to the Ingani are tombs built above family homes, as ornate as wealth and status allow.  <br/><br/><b>THE PALACE OF THE PRIEST-QUEEN</b><br/><br/>The Priest-Queen\u2019s compound is open to the avenues  and contains a menagerie, a bath house, a garrison and parade ground for the Royal Guard, a massive feast hall and kitchen, and, centrally, the palace itself.  The palace is the home of the Priest-Queen when she is in residence in Inganipuru, and to her attendants, functionaries, and retinue at all times.  It consists of a series of private and public chambers arranged in a closed square, all facing outward in the cardinal directions and topped by a massive open-air crypt.<br/><br/><b>LAIR OF THE BLOOD MUMMY</b><br/><br/>The rooftop necropolis has no doors or windows, only a four meter tall stone wall carved with intricate statuary depicting scenes from the lives of the Gods.  Four narrow, steep staircases rise from the palace grounds to sacrificial platforms at the top of each wall.  From these platforms, perched high above the necropolis, it\u2019s possible to look down and see various rooms and crenulated passageways, all open to the sky, including the massive and mysterious Gate of Yachay, which rises from the tomb at the epicenter of Ingani power and authority.  On auspicious festival days, offerings are made from the platforms \u2013 silver and gold ornaments, precious stones, and intricate crafts are tossed into the necropolis.  Zealous volunteers are led up the steps and dropped into the rooftop necropolis to feed Payquna III\u2019s distant ancestor, the blood mummy Muyu, called Mother of the People.  Muyu is magically sustained by the blood of these sacrifices.  <br/><br/><b>ADVENTURE SEEDS</b><br/><br/>Maybe the whole thing is fakery \u2013 there\u2019s access to the necropolis from within the palace, sacrificial victims are killed and fed to the horrible beasts chained up in the basement, the treasure is carted out and re-used.  Lord Amaru, a client state noble, hires the adventurers to expose the lie at the heart of Ingani power.<br/><br/>The Gate of Yachay is a magical barrier holding the demon Pampupatyi at bay, tended by the forgotten arcane rituals of the blood mummy.  Phuya, an Ingani sorceress, seeks to learn the rituals in time to prevent a disaster \u2013 for dread Muyu is falling apart.  Her request is denied by the Priest-Queen, but that\u2019s not going to stop her.<br/><br/>A whole royal lineage of insane undead blood freaks are up in there, not just one mummy!  As tomb-robbers or sacrificial prisoners, the adventurers are going over the wall into a blood-spattered, mummy-choked, open-air hell!<br/><br/>Payquna III has died, and all of Ingani is in mourning.  The Priest-Queen  is mummified in preparation for joining her ancestors in the necropolis.  But something unheard of has happened \u2013 Wichuy, the master necromancer, has failed to revive her as a blood mummy.  Luckily, one of the adventurers is just her size\u2026<br/><br/>Does it seem like a fun set-up?  Other ideas for adventure seeds or interesting bits?  What system would you use to run this?  Mostly I'm just in love with the title.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141119/#Comment_141119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T11:37:41+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 11:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it sounds like a lot of fun.

One note, the death of Payquna seed... this looks like a straight survival seed. Which I find to be problematic in that there can be little in the way of creative response (I run, I fight!) What am I missing about the situation? Is it a question of honor? What follow on questions could emerge in play to be answered? <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a seed I'd add to the ones you have... because you already have death and religion and other stuff covered, but somehow ommitted sex: <br/>\nDread Muyu is falling apart in part because she's not maintaining herself. This is because her mortal lover has fallen out of love with her. So she's been transitioning between self-destructive bouts of depression, and equally self-destructive bouts of trying to seduce men to find a replacement for her lost love. Forgetting in all of this to do the maintainence rituals that prevent her from rapidly decaying... <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I'd torque up the ick factor a little. <br/>\n<br/>\nRelationship map to come... also there's a myth behind all of this, that informs all of this, and I'm going to take a stab at that, too, if you don't mind...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141254/#Comment_141254" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T07:40:12+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  7:40AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, have at it!

Maybe that'd be stronger as a one-shot in which the player characters were her loyal servants, ritually killed, mummified, and reanimated with her.  Choose an early point of attack and they might be having second thoughts, or offers from various factions eager to get intelligence from "over the wall".  Late point of attack and it's a staid drama about the price of loyalty, unlife serving the eternal royals and protecting the royal loot.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't wait to see what you do with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141255/#Comment_141255" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T07:45:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  7:45AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, early point of attack is exactly what I'm thinking here... the current Priest-Queen is being poisoned, and not quite dead yet.
