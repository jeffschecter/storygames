                    Hi all,<br/>
I've just uploaded our new, expanded version of the good ole Theatrix Action flowchart. I don't know, maybe someone finds it as useful as we do...<br/>

Can you possibly summarize what all's different about it, and what you've achieved with the differences? Is it only the "evoke randomness" and "use random generator" boxes?<br/>

                            Hi Andy, hi Paul <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Andy, you asked:<br/>"1) How do you "Release the Tension"?"<br/>When you release the tension, you deliver the result of the character's action. You let the player know what happens. <br/><br/>"2) How do you "Give someone reason to Doubt"?"<br/>If you want to increase tension, you don't tell the players immediately what results their characters' actions have. You give them descriptions, but you remain vague. For instance: One of the heroes is pretty heavy, and not very athletic, and no good fighter. He has to fight against an opponent who seems vastly superior. However, the story would come to an end the players wouldn't like if he lost, so the GM decides that he wins. But he is so unskilled that his victory looks awkward, he wins not because he's so good, but because he's darn lucky. So the GM gives the player reason to doubt and describes his character being punched and kicked and pummeled, humiliated even. And then, when the player is almost as desperate as his character, his hero lands a lucky punch. The GM has given the player reason to doubt.<br/><br/>"3) What is "False Hope", and how do you give it?"<br/>False hope is when you let the characters win -- seemingly. This often occurs when a character is not really able to perform a task. Let's take another look at the example from above. This time, the GM has decided that the character loses, but the players are very interested in the fight. So, the GM decides to give the player false hope. "Wow, you didn't expect that your punch could hit someone like him, right? But it did! And he looks pretty shaken. Is that fear you see in his eyes?"<br/><br/>"4) What does "Breathing Room" mean?"<br/>When someone has been succesful, you can do two things: either you throw them into a new conflict, or you give them a break.<br/><br/>Does this make sense?<br/><br/>Paul, you wrote:<br/>"Can you possibly summarize what all's different about it, and what you've achieved with the differences? Is it only the "evoke randomness" and "use random generator" boxes?"<br/><br/>Sorry, yes. These are the only changes we made, but we thought they were necessary. I know, it's not much...<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Norbert                        </div>

We have something we call the "Trinity of Games" in our group:<br/>
Theatrix, Amber and Everway. These three games (and the books on improvisational theater by Johnstone) have changed our way and understanding of roleplaying forever.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. and completely Off-Topic:<br/>
My wife and I will have our interview with the US consulate general on May, 16. We have won in the Green Card Lottery, and if our health checks are OK and the consulate officers like us, then we should get our Green Card in a couple of months. Please keep your fingers crossed (or send Him a little prayer). Thanks so much.<br/>

                            Brand: it's only the ultimate illusionist handbook, when it hasn't handed over ultimate authorial power to the players. There's an example in the rulebook where the players figure out what the GM is doing, decide he's fallen into a predictable rut, and then spend a plot point to change everything around to be more entertaining.                        </div>

                            Neel, <br/><br/>That's one of the reasons I said it was an interesting beast. The use of plot points vs. pre-set plot is a vast and interesting subject in the book -- and one that is not always consistant or coherent. Because you can use plot points to get success and change the game, absolutly, unless the GM really doesn't want you to, in which case you can't, except when you can.... <br/><br/>I love reading the book because it's like watching the war of "who does the plot and how" play out in all its glory and terror.<br/><br/>Not to mention that it is one of the earliest games of a type that I've been seeing a lot of for the last few years: games that have both a "skill based" resolution system and a currency system that sits beside in, in which the interrelation of the two is not always perfectly balanced.                        </div>

                            Brand, I don't think the skill system in Theatrix is a resolution system! What it really does is give you instructions about how to narrate success or failure. There's a 2-by-2 box which lays it out like this:<br/>
<br/>
If the character has a high relative skill, and succeeds, then he or she succeeds due to internal factors -- his or her skill, mastery, understanding of the situation. <br/>
<br/>
If the character has a high relative skill, and fails, then he or she fails because of external factors -- the opposition cheated, or brought unexpected reinforcements, or the character's equipment fails, or things like that. <br/>
<br/>
If the character has a low relative skill, and succeeds, then he or she succeeds due to external factors, like dumb luck, the opposition making obvious mistakes, and things like that. <br/>
<br/>
If the character has a low relative skill, and fails, then the failure is due to factors internal to the character. The character's failure is squarely his or her fault. <br/>
<br/>
(As an aside, if you follow those four cases you won't have any complaints about "protagonism" or "whiff", ever. This was a major revelation to me back in 96 or 97, when I first read it.)<br/>
<br/>
This is not a resolution system, because it doesn't tell you how to decide what happens. <br/>
<br/>
I think the real resolution system happens with plot points, descriptors and flaws.                        </div>

                            Neel, <br/><br/>Fair enough descriptions! Of course, the book doesn't always lay them out like that. That's the "war" that I was talking about -- the back and forth and often lack of clarity about intent that goes on because the authors were obviously working very hard to get the non-mechanical systems part of their own games down in ordered form, and couldn't always do so perfectly. <br/><br/>I'd also argue that the real resolution system in Theatrix is GM fiat, modified by plot points, descriptors and flaws. Because while those three things are very important to the system* they are not the mechanic by which the average decision in the game is figured. They are the ones used when there is a particular focus to be pushed, usually by the players, in response to the standard resolution being "the GM decides based on the needs of the plot." <br/><br/>And that right there is why, even with the lovely little mechanic you outlined for describing success and failure, you will get issues of protaginization in play of Theatrix. (Wiff factor is a completly different issue.) That was my major revelation when I stopped playing Theatrix back in about 2001 -- because many of my players, as well as I myself, were starting to have real issues with playing to plot, no matter how skillfully the plot was run. <br/><br/><br/><br/>*These are the important part to the point at which the last time I played Theatrix I dumped skills and attributes all together and ran with a modded version of those puppies. Much like how when I play Truth and Justice these days the Hero Points are more important than attributes.                        </div>

                            Hi Brand, in my experience GMing Theatrix I never knew what the plot of the game would be. I mean, I had an idea at the start of the session, because you really need to push as hard as you can to keep the game moving, but that idea never survived to the end of the session. <br/>
<br/>
The real system for Theatrix is fiat, but the fiat is spread around the group. The GM is the default authority in the game, except for the subjects covered by the PCs' descriptors -- in those areas, the player with the descriptor is the default authority. If a player makes a statement about something his or her PC has a relevant descriptor, then that's what's true. If the GM doesn't like this, then his or her only recourse is to demand the player to spend a plot point. And if the player spends it, then it becomes a Statement and that's that. It looks like a GM could run down the players' supply of plot points, but that's only apparent, because players can always activate their flaws to get more plot points. <br/>
<br/>
So in equilibrium what happened for us is in dramatic scenes was:<br/>
<br/>
1. the GM would outline something unacceptable to a player.<br/>
2. The players deals with it with a Statement about why the situation is really the way they want.<br/>
3. The GM, seeing the tension drain away, would demand a plot point.<br/>
4. The player spends a plot point, usually activating a flaw to get it, and ends up creating a different plot twist. <br/>
<br/>
Extra plot points are what we used to make sure that stories end. If you build up a stock of them, then you can use them to wrap up the conflicts without creating new plot threads. <br/>
<br/>
The main difficulty I had with GMing Theatrix is that it's exhausting! The game makes it easy for the players to coast, because if the scene is going a way they like they don't need to do anything, but the GM has to push really hard to force the situation into a shape where the players feel the pressure and change it, and every time it changes you have to on-the-fly redo the plot to keep pushing.                        </div>

                            Oh yeah -- one other thing I agree with you about: I never understood why there were both attributes and skills, either.                        </div>

                            Neel, <br/><br/>That's fascinating. We must play Theatrix together someday, as my experience is very different than yours. I'd love to see you at work!                        </div>

                            I think the big missing bit in Theatrix (and many other games!) is something like bankuei/Chris Chinn's articles on Flag Framing and The Conflict Web. This is something that was hit or miss for me -- sometimes I'd have NPCs and conflicts that engaged with the PCs, and sometimes I didn't, and that was the difference between a game that rocked and a game that just sat there. <br/>
<br/>
Instead, Theatrix had this three-act Syd Field thing in it, which I could never make work. I think they were trying to explain the same thing bankuei was, but never figured out how to explain it very well. I had many long internet discussions with David Berkman on rgfa even before I bought the game, and he was adamant that "plot was character", and that had a big impact on how I approached the game. (And all games, actually.)                        </div>
