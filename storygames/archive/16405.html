Speaking to my own interest in it, I think that there are some outmoded ideas about publication and DRM and the way creative people feel a need to "protect" themselves from piracy.  We've been all over giving the game away from the get go, albeit in a limited form with a direct feedback loop (The Adventurer's Guild) that we benefited from.  One thing to remember is that the final, polished product isn't "free".  We won't be posting the full PDF with all the art up on our site for download.  That said, if people want the "source code" of DW, they can always get it and lay out the pieces they need, make micro-versions, mods, hacks, etc etc and make Dungeon World their own as a result of the XML data.  Philosophically, it made sense to us to make that part of it CC because, honestly, we're hackers ourselves and we want to encourage more of it.  Sage and I are both in the software industry professionally and have been working on DW like it was a piece of software all the way through (tracking bugs, releasing patches and beta versions and all that on the regular).  DW was developed in an open space, why not leave the source code that way?  A big part of it is just that we're really excited and want to see what happens.<br/><br/>On the fiscal side, yeah, of course we'd like to see some money come back for the hours we've sunk into the game.  We know that the PDF will end up on demonoid, we know that people have friends of friends and people will share legit copies with their group.  We understand that it's not something we wanted to try and "protect" ourselves against.  What we have to offer that people will want to pay for is the polish of the final product, you know?  Cool art, the layout, awesome bonuses that you'll see in our kickstarter.  PDFs are awesome, but speaking anecdotally, it seems to me that they're still a peripheral media engine.  People still like the print artifact.  The shelf candy.  We think that's what people will pay for.  <br/><br/>DW is engineered for accessibility, you know?  I remember being 14 and being too fucking poor to afford D&amp;D books and it being incredibly shitty.  You want to play DW?  We're going to make sure you damn well get to.  You want a .txt file of the rules?  Go for it.  You want to pirate a PDF?  Well, we'd obviously prefer you didn't but we're not going to be unrealistic and hell, maybe you'll share it with someone else who can afford it.  You want a print version, that option is going to be there, too, and it's going to have all the bells and whistles, etc.  We didn't make DW to make a profit.  We made it because we love D&amp;D and we love RPGs and we wanted to make a game that other people would want to play and have a good time doing it.  Money would be cool, but what kind of insane person says "I am going to quit my job and live off a single release of a role playing game?"  Well, okay, maybe someone does, but that's not us.<br/><br/>I bet Sage has a lot more to say, too, but that's my five cents.  We're both totally open to answering any questions people might have about the game and our design / release process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374831/#Comment_374831" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T06:12:48+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  6:12AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *stands behind Adam with an enormous american flag, which waves majestically in the wind*<br/><br/>Seriously, that's some inspiring stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374841/#Comment_374841" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T08:43:04+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  8:43AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>*stands behind Adam with an enormous american flag, which waves majestically in the wind*<br/><br/>Seriously, that's some inspiring stuff.</blockquote>\nMake it a Canadian flag and you're set.  *wink*<br/><br/>The thing is, I mean, this whole thing might just tank on us but ultimately, we're making a thing we love so that we (and you!) can play a rad game and hang out with our friends and tell fun stories about monsters and heroics and magic spells and junk.

So, if I have: <br/><br/>1) FATE released under the OGL. <br/>2) Dungeon World released under CC-BY. <br/><br/>If I make up something that has content from both, then if I call it OGL, then I am putting additional restrictions on the Dungeon World content which isn't allowed.  If I call it CC-BY, then I am opening up FATE further which isn't allowed under the OGL.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375227/#Comment_375227" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T14:37:24+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  2:37PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No John, it doesn't work like that. What you're thinking of are infectious licenses that force derivative products to abide by the same license. This is a common set-up, especially in the software markets, but the Creative Commons license discussed here is not one of those. Pretty much the entire gist of the license is that you can reuse the material provided that you attribute properly. The new work does not need to be CC licensed. I know that the prior art is misleading - I, for example, licensed the third edition of TSoY with the same licenses that Clinton did, even as <i>I didn't have to</i>.<br/><br/>(There is a CC variant that is infectious in this sense, but I understand that that's not what's going on here. Can't remember offhand what it's called.)<br/><br/>OGL, on the other hand, places no restrictions on the content except the curious limitation that you cannot attribute without permission. (I'm sure that one makes sense in the misty mind of some lawyer somewhere.) However, if you got permission to attribute the Dungeon World material you use (or perhaps assumed that the <i>requirement</i> to attribute caused by the license is also a tacit permission), there is no conflict between the two licenses that I can see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375229/#Comment_375229" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T14:39:47+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  2:39PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, it's "share-alike", the term Creative Commons uses for an infectious license that requires any derivatives to commit to the same licensing terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375230/#Comment_375230" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T14:40:24+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  2:40PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "sticky" version is Creative Commons Share Alike.

Therefore, John Walton (or any person other than Adam and Sage) can only license Dungeon World under the OGL if every right reserved by Adam and Sage under CC BY is also reserved under the OGL. However, there are a few areas where the OGL is more liberal than CC BY; where the rights reserved by Adam and Sage under CC BY could be abrogated by someone using Dungeon World under the OGL. The ones I could find are:<br/><br/>* Adaptations must be clearly labelled as such (CC BY 3.0 Universal 3(b)).<br/>* All notices that refer to the CC BY licence must be kept intact (4(a))<br/>* Works under CC BY cannot be distributed under DRM (4(a))<br/>* When works are adapted or collected, the attribution for the CC BY licensed work must be listed in the credits and at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors (4(b))<br/><br/>None of these are required for the OGL, so CC BY does not entitle anyone other than Adam and Sage to license DW under the OGL.<br/><br/>Of course, since Adam and Sage are both talking in this thread and don't seem to have a problem with the OGL, a happy solution seems obvious!<br/><br/>(PS I've said this privately but I'll say it again: I was really pleased by this development, and by Mist-Robed Gate taking this route earlier.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375488/#Comment_375488" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T10:58:23+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 10:58AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also wanted to add that this is very cool.

That is, you have the freedom as the publisher to declare parts of the product at hand to be OGL, while other parts are specifically not. People use this often by e.g. assigning the text as OGL or only the stat blocks, while leaving the layout and graphics and whatnot under ordinary considerations. You have to declare any OGL parts you loaned from elsewhere as OGL, but for the rest you can technically make any practical separations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375542/#Comment_375542" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T13:00:46+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  1:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... seems like the moral is <i>don't use DW with OGL content unless you are or have hired a decent lawyer, because the licenses may interact in complicated ways that you may not fully anticipate.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375543/#Comment_375543" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T13:01:10+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  1:01PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that there are two separate issues here: whether derivative material must come under the same licence as the original work (what I would call share-alike) and whether part of a work can be licensed differently to other parts.<br/><br/>Material that is derivative of someone else's Open Game Content must itself be Open Game Content.

You'll have product identity that you need to call out in the licensing statement anyway.<br/>2. "Product Identity" doesn't mean anything to the CC-BY license, so something can be OGL "product identity" and still be CC-BY. (Product Identity just mean "not OGL licensed")<br/>3. You'll have a copyright declaration at the end of your OGL text. I mean, you'd have this anyway, right?<br/>4. You can mention, in the copyright declaration, that the copyright to the DW portion is owned by Sage and Adam (therefore fulfilling the "BY" portion of CC-BY) and further stating that those portions are released under the CC-BY license.<br/><br/>Therefore, you'll have a product identity declaration anyway, you're just adding the DW content to that. You'd have a copyright declaration for the DW content anyway, you'll just include a short declaration about the CC-BY license. It's all the same stuff you'd have in that big OGL text block anyway, some things are just moved from one portion to another. And you might have to add a single sentence to the copyright declaration that you wouldn't normally have to. I mean, OGL already has that handy dandy out clause right there, so you can easily define the things that aren't covered by the license. There's nothing (that I know of) to prevent you from releasing the PI under another license.<br/><br/>I AM NOT A LAWYER.

Some bits to note in order of their noteworthiness:<br/><br/>"legalcode": Adding this to the url takes you to the full license, not the summary that the DW text cites. Is that necessary? Not really.<br/><br/>The rest of the web address: The license requires a copy of the license or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to be included. The CC website defines URI as "such as a weblink."<br/><br/>Attributing Vincent Baker: Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson get "original material" credits in a lot of OGL section 15 stuff, so I would say it's courteous to put Vx in here.<br/><br/>The copyright year: Some DW stuff is copyright 2011, I didn't see an actual copyright notice on the CC-BY release but I didn't look very hard (because, uh, fuck your xml bullshit?) so I just put the 2012 date and figured the earlier stuff is its own thing.<br/><br/>So there you go.

However, if DW were under the OGL I could distribute it with DRM. If a third party tried to put DW under the OGL, that would entitle people to distribute it with DRM and therefore violate a condition of CC BY.

You have a point, Chris. It does say under section 4(a): "You may not sublicense the Work." (I hate it when I miss stuff!)<br/><br/>If you incorporate DW stuff in a derivative work (I assume it would be a "collection" and not an "adaptation") you can always put it under the "Designation of Open Game Content" as specifically excluded from open game content, probably something like this:<br/><br/>All text and tables, with the exception of material specifically excluded in the declaration of product identity and all material originally appearing in Dungeon World, copyright 2012 Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel and released under a CC-BY license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode</a>), are open game content.<br/><br/>As to your individual points:\n<blockquote>* Adaptations must be clearly labelled as such (CC BY 3.0 Universal 3(b)).</blockquote>\nI dunno why somebody would do an adaptation, aside from a translation. If you're doing anything people normally do with the OGL, that's a collection.\n<blockquote>* All notices that refer to the CC BY license must be kept intact (4(a))</blockquote>\nYeah, just include the web address.\n<blockquote>* Works under CC BY cannot be distributed under DRM (4(a))</blockquote>\nThat's your interpretation, the license just says "When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License." I dunno my DRMs, though! What kind were you thinking of? Does it prevent you from copying and pasting sections of text?\n<blockquote>* When works are adapted or collected, the attribution for the CC BY licensed work must be listed in the credits and at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors (4(b))</blockquote>\nYou must "keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied" and "(ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work".<br/><br/>As far as I can see from the xml files, no copyright notice has been supplied, and names of Original Authors have not been supplied either (in the Work, I mean, obviously we all know who they are). In the case of copyright notice, you would still be required to list it, no matter what, since legally the act of creation implies it whether it is supplied or not. The title has been supplied, obviously, and so has the license.<br/><br/>As for listing their names as big as yours:<br/>"The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors."<br/>If I was using DW stuff in my collection and I didn't want Sage and Adam's names as big as mine I'd just credit myself as the editor.

As soon as content is licensed under the OGL, it can be used exclusively according to the terms of the OGL - and the terms of CC BY can be ignored. <br/><br/>But if that were to happen in this case, then some of CC BY's more restrictive clauses would not apply (because they are not present in the OGL). So people could get rights that Adam and Sage haven't given up - which would be a violation of CC BY.<br/><br/>Your analysis shows that people are <i>able</i> to comply with both the OGL and CC BY, but the question here is whether the terms of the OGL would <i>oblige</i> them to comply with CC BY. If not, then DW content cannot be licensed under the OGL by a third party.<br/><br/>(In terms of whether 'effective technological measures' is a synonym for DRM, it's sometimes used by Creative Commons themselves <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_do_I_do_if_someone_tries_to_restrict_my_work_with_digital_rights_management_.28DRM.29.3F" rel="nofollow">in that way</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8080" rel="nofollow">sometimes not</a>. Of course, the licences stand on their own; once they've been written down, Creative Commons' opinion is no more legally valuable than yours or mine).<br/><br/>Anyway, I think we agree now!

None of the CC licences limit your options - for example, if you have the right to do something under regular copyright law, you are guaranteed to still have it if you use someone's CC material - but the OGL does. In other words, CC licences give you extra rights provided you do X; OGL gives you extra rights and takes away existing rights if you do X. (The existing rights it takes away are all - to my knowledge - surrounding Product Identity and trademarks). Given that, I think CC would be leery to create interoperability with the OGL.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Wizards of the Coast is releasing a new edition of Dungeons and Dragons next year. We know that they're thinking seriously about licensing, that several designers are talking about a potential licensing scheme, and that 4E's very restrictive GSL was not popular. Given all that, I think pushing for an OGL 2.0 that's compatible with CC BY-SA might be the best way to achieve interoperability.<br/><br/>(EDIT: On the other hand, if you do want to approach CC, they're drafting version 4.0 of the licences at the moment, so speak now or forever hold your peace!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375967/#Comment_375967" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T14:17:57+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  2:17PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really don't see the compatibility issues.<br/><br/>Say you create something that is a derivative of both DW and D20.

That restriction would also make it pretty hard for an OGL 2.0 license to include CC material unless it streamlined the "quarantine" solution we've agreed on here, but hey, maybe it will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376003/#Comment_376003" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T16:15:42+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  4:15PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It feels like initiatives like this could be relevant to our community:<br/><br/><a href="http://questioncopyright.org/free_culture_thing" rel="nofollow">Free Culture Thing</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376056/#Comment_376056" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T21:07:11+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  9:07PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2012 11:31PM by Bryant.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite><br/>I actually think we have a better chance of changing the OGL to be compatible with a CC licence (presumably CC BY-SA) rather than vice versa.

However, the CC licences are only directed at copyright (and a few related rights). The words 'Dungeon World' are a trademark, and nothing in the CC licence entitles you to use them (nothing in the CC licence stops you from using them either). <br/><br/>So you could certainly write a novel that replicated or adapted text from Dungeon World (and there are some lovely monster entries and class descriptions that you might be able to use for such a purpose). But calling it 'a Dungeon World novel' or releasing a movie called 'Dungeon World' could be violations of an entirely different area of law to that covered by the licence.<br/><br/>EDIT:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Bryant</cite>Much belated edit: of course, the best possible revamp would be if Hasbro just used some form of CC.

If that's what you want to do, just write up a clean and unambiguous licensing permission stating thus. Get some help and have a few people with their heads on their shoulders (lawyers maybe, if you believe in such) check out that you've written what you thought you did. It's shallow thinking to rely on the "officialness" of famous licensing models like OGL or Creative Commons to make them somehow more binding or serious than if you just write your own license. The only advantage those licenses have (aside from immediate recognizability) is that it'd take perhaps a bit more balls to flout the license, but I don't think that that's a very decisive advantage; the weakest part of your legal arsenal is your own willingness to enforce your rights, and that's something that licensing terms do nothing to improve. (Also obviously those licenses are written with less wormholes than an average bear's attempt at legalese, but because your ability to actually utilize your rights under a licensing scheme depends on your ability to understand the license, I don't think that anybody who understands what CC licenses do would do too badly writing their own.)<br/><br/>Also, match your legal securities to the scale of your project. Unless you think that your IP is worth millions of dollars, you'll probably be more than fine enough with a layman-written license. And if you think that your IP is worth so large amounts of money that somebody will try to utilize some legal trickery to steal it, then you're presumably willing to pay for a corresponding amount of legal expertise in helping you write up your licensing terms. It seems to me in this regard that the system works reasonably well, and there really isn't a significant legal security hole at any scale of operation. These modern boilerplate public licenses are just an additional tool in the toolbox, and a great way to increase awareness about open culture; they do not enable you to do anything entirely different from what you've always been able to do.<br/><br/>If you feel really uncertain about how to go about something like this, just write an informal public statement of intent and invite anybody who wants to use your work to contact you so you can talk out the details. Then you can license your work on a case by case basis, which is much easier, as you can just decide for each project whether it's something you want to allow. Saying "I'm willing to license this work for free to further rpg-related projects, so let me know if you'd like to do something" is not a<br/>license in itself, but I think it makes it pretty clear who should bother to contact you about it and who shouldn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376252/#Comment_376252" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T14:53:37+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  2:53PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is <b>extremely</b> good advice.<br/><br/>I just trawled my social networking sites, and discovered that I went to high school with one person who became a lawyer, and college with another.
