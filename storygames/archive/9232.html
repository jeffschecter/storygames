As I said, right now it's a bunch of scribbled notes and notions.  So, here are my notions.<br/><br/>So one of the things that always frustrates in me games is when there's some Canon Rule about the setting that players CAN'T break because that's how the world "is" which lasts right up until some Canon NPC comes along who is the uber-exception to the rule. So I wanted to make a game that encouraged making rules about "how the world works" then shattering them at dramatic moments. Hence, the "exceptional" in Exceptional Fantasy. Everybody gets to break one rule right at character creation.<br/><br/>So if in your world "Undead are severed from life and can't be Druids" it would be perfectly fine for a PC to be "The one undead who through sheer force of will has grasped onto his connection with life to be a druid."<br/><br/>In play every time a rule is reinforced it gets "stronger" which means it both gets harder to break but also becomes more effective when you break it. There would of course be ways of adding new Canon Rules and the such.<br/><br/>The second notion is that anything that happens in WoW Lore always happens at a high level. You don't have individual scenes you have declarations like, "And that's when Thrall invaded Northrend" or whatever. So that's how play works. You declare MASSIVE world scale behaviors. You don't "Visit Janna Proudmore" You "Sign a diplomatic treaty with Janna Proudmore" and so forth. You don't do things to build up to war, you just go ahead and Invade. You then play out scenes under that world altering heading.<br/><br/>A third notion is that the stats will be Warfare, Diplomacy, Subterfuge and Romance.<br/><br/>A fourth notion is that there always seems to be some kind of World Threat hanging over everything that gets built up the longer it goes unattended to. So there's some kind of timing mechanic. Right now it's a d20 sitting in the middle of the table. At each value of 5 (5, 10, 15) a sort of mini-boss "spawns." These mini-bosses sort of "stack" so if the 5 mini-boss isn't dealt with by the time the 10 shows up then they make each other more powerful. This happens all the way up until the 20 which represents the main villain behind what the mini-bosses have been up to. Again these stack. Assuming the threat doesn't destroy the world or anything it eventually resets and New Threat arises.<br/><br/>One other notion is that the Canon Rules are associated with things.  So you have the Canon Rules for Stormwind.  The Canon Rules for Undead.  The Canon Rules for the Argent Dawn.  And so forth.  If ALL the rules associated with a concept get broken then something earth shattering happens to it.  It gets destroyed or transformed or whatever and a new set of Canon Rules are written for it.<br/><br/>So.... that's what I've got.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204237/#Comment_204237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T14:46:20+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  2:46PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks like tons of fun. <br/><br/>When you said, "The second notion is that anything that happens in WoW Lore always happens at a high level," I got a little confused.

I have some notions about a setup process that would produce your own world.<br/><br/>The reason I said that was because that notion was inspired by me watching The Wrath of the Lich King installer and the little story it told.  It was all expressed in these HUGE STATEMENTS.  So I thought about a game that was structured like that.<br/><br/>Uh, notions about this building process include the idea that everyone defines for themselves a Race, A Nation, A World Role and An Organization.  They then write 3 to 5 Canon Rules for each and pick one to immediately break for their own character.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204242/#Comment_204242" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T14:51:58+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  2:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you generate the initial heavy mass of canon to be "messed with"?

Right now at character creation each player invents a Race, A Nation, A World Role and An Organization their character belongs to.  They write three Canon Rules for each of these things.  That makes each character 100% unique though with no overlap.<br/><br/>So I might change it so there's a "World Building Phase"  Where you generate as a group Race = Number of Players, Nations = Number of Players, Organizations = Number of Players.  Something like that.<br/><br/>The point is there's a step in play where a whole bunch of setting material and the Canon Rules for that material gets generated.  So you end up with stuff like:<br/><br/>The Order of the Mourning Tree<br/>-----All members are men.<br/>-----No member may use magic<br/>-----They are the sworn enemy of Shalmanisar The Wicked<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. If you can't tell this project is a big "Fuck You" to Canon/Fandom Wankery.  <br/><br/>Canon Wanker: "But.... But.... You're a member of The Mourning Tree, you *can't* use magic!"<br/>Player: (Strikes through: No member may use magic)  "Guess that makes me pretty exceptional then doesn't it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204249/#Comment_204249" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T15:18:17+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  3:18PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>The second notion is that anything that happens in WoW Lore always happens at a high level.

One level are these HUGE declarations.  The other is individual scenes within that context.  So yes, there are action level scenes.  I'm thinking about linking stuff to the stats and creating a kind of scene economy.  So it looks something like this.<br/><br/>High Level:<br/>-----Shalmanisar The Wicked declares a Warfare action and "Unleashes an army of demons upon the capital city of Shadowspire"<br/><br/>Lower Level<br/>-----Jonas The Noble has a Warfare score of three.  So he gets three scenes within a Warfare action.  He uses one to have a Romance scene where he says farewell to his lady love before going off to fight the demons.<br/><br/>Something like that anyway.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204266/#Comment_204266" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T17:11:05+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  5:11PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, that sounds very neat.<br/><br/>I can almost see something like you build up the score of each rule by having scenes in which the rule is enforced and then when you break it it is more exceptional and has more weight later on. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204267/#Comment_204267" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T17:25:37+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  5:25PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite><br/>I can almost see something like you build up the score of each rule by having scenes in which the rule is enforced and then when you break it it is more exceptional and has more weight later on.<br/></blockquote>\nYup.

I think the one thing you might be surprised at is that it might not scratch the itch as well as you think. Part of the fun of rule-breaking characters is that the other <i>person at the table</i> is shocked, shocked and surprised, and if everyone there knows that you can do that, nobody will be shocked or surprised. They can play their characters that way of course, and that is fun too, but something is definitely lost by "giving permission".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204512/#Comment_204512" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T12:49:44+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 12:49PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD,<br/><br/>This game isn't a reaction to people who have been functionally breaking canon assumptions for dramatic effect.
