Here you can see a short chronicle and a few impressions and notes.<br/><br/><b>Characters Creation</b><br/>They were new to the AW system and its hacks, so it took a while; also, they\u2019re not familiar with English as much as I hoped but I will translate the playbooks to Italian only when I will learn to be able to sleep only 2-hours every night :-)<br/>We created 3 characters: Eden \u2013 a young female sorceress \u2013 Gladwin \u2013 a hunter \u2013 and Tacitus \u2013 a veteran. The veteran was \u201cmy\u201d character \u2013 even though I was also the GM \u2013 and a sort of \u201cshared\u201d resource for the group. They were in love with the non-fighter playbooks but thinking that a sword will come handy. So I told them to trust me but also that I would place a veteran in the group, just if they needed him to go ahead with sword in hand against some peril.<br/>As I told them, they had plenty of space in the game to do other things, rather than fight, and the veteran had quite a boring mission, doing basically nothing but just looking intimidating.<br/>Eden as I said was a young sorceress, and she is in love with a noble woman, named Vita (this was Eden\u2019s Weakness). Eden received from Vita a precious ring (the Precious Thing) but she doesn\u2019t know if the noble woman reciprocates her love. To try to gain prestige, fame and money, Eden joined the Iron Fist (Roots), hoping that this will make the Vita notice her.<br/>Gladwin is from a small village which was destroyed by monsters; for this reason he became a hunter and is now seeking revenge against the evil beasts, in his missions with the Iron Fist (Roots). Gladwin treasures a cheap necklace that was his sister\u2019s (Precious Thing); the sister\u2019s corpse was never found and Gladwin is still looking for her everywhere, with the hope somehow she survived the massacre (Weakness).<br/><br/><b>How the session went</b><br/>The characters were sent by the Iron Fist to a small village to investigate a problem: a few people have disappeared in the past weeks and the villagers paid the Iron Fist to resolve the situation. Nobody knows if there\u2019s sorcery at work, demons or evil forces, monsters or a perfectly natural explanation for what\u2019s going on. When they reach the village, Eden and Gladwin meet with Eban and Efraim, who are Iron Fist\u2019s recruits stationed in the village, which is also a small traders\u2019 stop along the route to Jerusalem.<br/>They were the ones who sent the reports about the issue to the Iron Fist headquarter and encouraged the villagers to hire the mercenaries to solve the problem. After speaking with the head of the village and with the two recruits, it becomes clear that Efraim is understandably worried for what\u2019s going on, and insisted to send the reports to the Iron Fist headquarter. Eban on the other hand tries to minimize what\u2019s happening and complains when he\u2019s asked to pick his turn to keep guard to the village at night and so on. He is of course hiding something and the characters quickly understand that.<br/>The characters get busy: Gladwin with the help of his loyal hounds is collecting precious information; Eban is somehow a threat, the hounds indicate him as problematic, and link his presence near the houses of the victims, but of course Eban has an explanation for that. He was just checking out the scene after the disappearance of the victims. Even with Eban nagging and causing some trouble, Gladwin picks up a track near the village.<br/>In the meanwhile, Eden uses her charm spell against an already friendly Efraim, and she obtains for herself a much better room in the Iron Fist house in the village, which is usually used only for paying rich merchants. Everybody has different priorities in life.<br/>During his night shift on the watch, Gladwin picks up the track again, and this time ventures out of the village. He avoids the mysterious threat at the beginning and understands it is some kind of monster or similar, but afterwards the monster manages to sneak behind him, closing the way back to the village. Gladwin picks his bow and the first arrow misses the target, but when the beast is almost upon him, a second arrow placed neatly in the monster throat, puts it down.<br/>It\u2019s a lion man (like a centaur, but with the body of a large lion instead of that of a horse); it is wounded very seriously and losing a lot of blood. Gladwin puts his hounds to keep the monster down and goes to get Eden; the sorceress manages to save the monster from death and the characters start to threaten it, to convince it to start talking.. Their threats fail to impress the beast, which just roars savagely to call for help. So the characters quickly carry the monster back to the village and lock it up in the Iron Fist armory.<br/>Efraim runs to wake up the head of the village and organize a defense, in case other lion men will show up, while Eban runs for the door, shocked at the sight of the captured lion man. He probably thought he had more time at hand to plan his disappearance. Eden shows that she can use her magic for something else than just obtaining a comfy bed, and slows down Eban so that Gladwin and the hounds can stop him. A short fight begins, but while Gladwin receives just a superficial cut from Eban\u2019s sword, the traitor is badly hurt and then disarmed by the hounds. <br/>Eban surrenders, and this time Eden and Gladwin manage a decent interrogation, threatening terrible consequences for the traitor by the Iron Fist itself. Eban took money from the lion men, to pick victims for them: he gave them a farmer, an old lady and a young girl over the course of the past few weeks, but he tries to justify himself. He has debts, the monsters had plenty of money to offer him, and he tried to give them preys that nobody will miss or that caused some trouble in the village. <br/>Eden and Gladwin are not moved to compassion and extract from Eban more information: the lion men are working for a mysterious sorcerer, which apparently came only recently to the area and is stationed in an old tower in the nearby forest. The victims were for him, and there\u2019s some dark magic at work here, for sure.<br/><br/>(continues in the next post...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441180/#Comment_441180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-05T10:30:30+00:00" title="January  5, 2015 10:30AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Technicalities</b><br/>The various Moves worked well, the various options provided good inspiration for the fiction and it was nice to see the Players quickly getting into the spirit of the game, looking for options that were both tactically sound for the given situation, or that provided a clear fictional advantage. For example, in the final fight with Eban, Gladwin the hunter always picked options that would keep Eban trapped and unable to run away, rather than just aim to inflict more damage and just \u201cwin\u201d the fight.<br/>The Advantage Die worked well, it was used by both Players and both really liked it; it came up when important and they said it was very cool to have an instrument that would give them a key to success once or twice, when they really desperately wanted it.<br/>Perhaps everything was even too easy for them, but wow, they had a looooong series of very lucky rolls, a lot of 10+ without even needing the Stats bonuses. But anyway it was the first session and it\u2019s good that they feel confident in their characters, they feel they can push forward and not just watch their backs.<br/>As a critical change to the mechanics, though, this playtest confirmed that the Taint Tracker needs to go back to its original configuration. When I created the Taint Tracker for this game, it was increased when a character took -1 Spirit; in a few cases it looked really merciless and hard so I changed it to increasing only when a character is Tainted (Spirit gets to a score value of -1).<br/>Well, the initial design was correct; so from the next iteration the manual will again say \u201cIncrease the Taint Tracker whenever a character gets a -1 to Spirit\u201d. Otherwise it will take ages to bring demons and supernatural into the game.<br/>Even Equipment was perhaps too generous in this configuration, but the Players loved it and it worked actually as expected. The characters didn\u2019t have troubles for now to find what they needed in their bags: they had arrows; they had materials for spells and such. But in fact, they just left Jerusalem and this is just the beginning of the adventure. If they have to spend a night crawling towards the dark sorcerer\u2019s tower, and then get in, and take him out, I guess there will be occasions when they will run out of something.<br/><br/><b>Game pace</b><br/>I liked the mission concept, and I believe it works well as a starting point for the game. AW or DW might give the players the feeling that they have more control over the setting for example or even the destiny of their own characters, but City of Judas is built, in purpose, differently.<br/>It does not aim to generate drama or force creativity out of the Players from the start; the purpose of the first mission and the idea behind the missions for the Iron Fist in general, is to provide focus. Resolve the mission, play to investigate, to resolve, to win the fight, and in the process, learn to know and love the characters. And then, only then, weaknesses, roots, background elements, come into play.<br/>I think this requires a bit more time than an AW or DW one-shot or similar; the game is built for something longer although all the Players I had until now, liked it from the first session \u2013 which is flattering but not the point here.<br/>The game needs a bit of time to get all its gears in motion: at the start I guess I could compare it to a Monster Of The Week adventure more than AW or DW. There is less control over the setting and there is something to accomplish, a mission to complete. <br/>But once the Spirit counters go down, when the Taint Tracker increases, while the characters go on with their missions, and the demons begin to show up and present a stronger menace, and when little by little the various background elements come up into play, from a mission-to-mission game, the City of Judas has the potential to become something more.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Just in case someone is interested in the beta, that is still avail. for free, you can find it on RpgNow: <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/131521/City-Of-Judas" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpgnow.com/product/131521/City-Of-Judas</a><br/>and on my website <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/judas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.daimongames.com/judas.html</a><br/><br/>These that are avail. for free are still version 0.7 and a rough beta.<br/>I am running a small group of playtesters who received version 0.8 that is a full manual, and I am working on version 0.9 that should be the final iteration before I am ready to somehow publish.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
