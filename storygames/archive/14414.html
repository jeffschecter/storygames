Most of this is GM stuff, but a lot of it can be used by players too.<br/><br/><b>Contests</b><br/><br/>Perception<br/><br/>Perception contests are a good example of how you can establish some best practices for Contests.<br/><br/>In a lot of RPGs, you want to search something, or see if you notice something, and you roll, and if you succeed you do, and if you don't, you don't. So the natural thing to do when you're running/playing Smallville and someone yells "I search the office for clues!" is to reach for those dice, you rolling your Value + Relationship + Investigator (or whatever) Distinction, and the GM rolling Trouble. STOP, don't do this yet! <br/><br/>Do NOT roll Trouble unless there is some feasible Stress that could come from the opposition.  A room full of stuff is not inherently stressful.<br/><br/>Step one is the GM identifying the Stress that could come from the situation.  <i>If you can't get a solid Stress, do not have anyone roll, just give them the answer.</i><br/><br/>Picking Stress is almost too easy.  It is an easy pitfall to just say that any failure could result in Exhausted, Insecure or Angry Stress.  This devalues Stress, which is a wonderful thing on the character sheet (and the way that characters advance).  Here's some thoughts on picking the right Stress:<br/><br/>Angry: This is most suitable for perception situations that might be frustrating.  The character wants to pin this on someone they hate and they just can't find the evidence they need.  They'd rather be punching someone. They'd rather be strangling their enemy but instead they're reduced to trying to find out what they're up to.<br/><br/>Insecure: This is ideal for characters who are highly invested in how smart or how good an investigator they are.  Your average jock meathead is not going to be less secure if they can't find an unusual transaction in a pile of bank records.  They are just not that invested in an image of themselves as someone that could find this.  However, when Sherlock Holmes misses an obvious clue, he beats himself up about it, says he's worthless, a fool, etc.<br/><br/>Exhausted: This is ideal for searching MASSIVE amounts of input - a whole library of books, thousands of transaction records...if the scene is a character burning the midnight oil and falling asleep on a massive tome, and the question is whether at the end they wake up and scream "YEAH, I GOT IT!" or are dejected and wasted in the next scene, Exhausted is a good Stress.<br/><br/>Injured: Are you searching a highly guarded facility with tons of armed guards a la Sam Fisher? Good, you got shot/punched when you were looking around.  Or the bomb you didn't know was there, set to destroy all the evidence goes off. This one's pretty easy.<br/><br/>Afraid: Is there something that they could find that could frighten them? Is a m-m-m-m-MONSTER going to jump out of the haunted library shelves?  Again, pretty easy.<br/><br/>Okay, so you've picked a Stress! Next we try to decide if/how the Contest will resolve.  Remember that the roll is not necessarily to see if the character will succeed in what they're trying to do....but someone has to work that out. Obviously if one particular way is necessary for the story to move forward, go that way. But that's pretty rare in Smallville, since there's a GM and you can always go to another Lead or Feature and yell at them to discover what you couldn't by investigating around.  And if they are really barking up the wrong tree, they can't succeed no matter how well they do.  Really we're talking about situations in the middle. How can you tell if or how the character should succeed?<br/><br/>The key is to listen to <i>what Values and Relationships they're using</i>.<br/><br/>More on this later!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327810/#Comment_327810" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T11:46:39+00:00" title="June  5, 2011 11:46AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually this is something that I've seen in a lot of games with "conflict resolution" type of mechanics. The character gets into a situation and he's trying to do something, and the game system says "Oh, this system doesn't tell you if he does what he's trying to do, it just tells you if there's a complication when it happens." Well, if the system doesn't tell you whether he does what he's trying to do, <i>who does?</i>  Smallville has a GM, so it makes sense that it would be the GM.  So how do you decide?  <br/><br/>As I mentioned above, there are extreme cases that make it obvious. If the character is trying to do something that's nearly impossible (find someone who doesn't exist, etc.) failure tells them something about the road they're on and moves the story along to the next thing.  If they're trying to do something that's right on the money, they should succeed in what they're trying to do.  But what about the middle road? Let's look at some examples:<br/><br/>"I demand to see the detective in charge, I'm not taking no for an answer" This is a good one to give them a success on, because it <i>leads them to an important character</i>.  Characters are central to story play, so anything that reduces abstractions ("the police investigation") to a character ("Detective McNulty") is good for the game and you should get it done as soon as possible.<br/><br/>"I sneak into the computer center, what do I find?" Fishing expeditions that take people away from the rest of the group are bad. Especially if they're barking up the wrong tree or only duplicating/confirming what others have found.  You might either give a trivial success ("You confirm what you already knew") or a failure that moves things forward ("you're confident there's nothing in here about what you want.")   Fishing expeditions are especially not supported by Smallville because the Value/Relationship system requires them to develop what they're after. Letting them get too far away from that core will leave both them and the system floundering.<br/><br/>"I sneak into the villain's lair and try to get some info from the minions".  Stupid ideas that get people in over their heads are a must-succeed situation.  Never let them out of this once it's come out of their mouths.  They are in.<br/><br/>"I'm going to try to smuggle the tater tots into class, so I can eat them during history."  Bizarre or weird things, you should probably approve, so long as you can get some idea of what they intend to do.  Asking is a good idea. If it seems totally out of left field, this is a strong indication that the player is interested enough in doing this without your help. Don't block 'em out, let it in and listen to where it goes.<br/><br/>Principles:<br/><br/>* Leads to an important character: this one should succeed if possible.<br/>* Into the lion's den: should succeed if possible.<br/>* A blind alley, away from the actions of others: probably fail<br/>* Fishing expeditions: probably fail, they should have some clear idea of what they're after<br/>* Out of left field - when in doubt, let it happen.<br/><br/>Smallville helps you use these principles by having people state why they are doing what they're doing with every single roll. So the Value and Relationship rolled helps you determine how you should resolve the action of the Contest.  The roll tells you about the complications and potential Stress that might come of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327813/#Comment_327813" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T12:11:35+00:00" title="June  5, 2011 12:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent advice as always, Jason! Another big consideration is Abilities and Distinctions, some of which offer a direct outcome with a Plot Point spend and thus avoid rolling dice at all. Abilities, especially, have SFX that make resolving some issues trivial. Super-strength has "I pick up the car and throw it into the street" with a PP. Super-speed has "I race across the Midwest and get to the courthouse in time for the trial" with a PP. Even then, some things don't even require a PP spend. "I push over the desk" or "I run through the mall to the Apple Store" don't need PP spends, if you've got the Abilities. As you say, there's just no reason to roll dice or ask for PP if the outcome's generally undramatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327830/#Comment_327830" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T14:31:18+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  2:31PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Characters are central to story play, so anything that reduces abstractions ("the police investigation") to a character ("Detective McNulty") is good for the game and you should get it done as soon as possible.</blockquote>\nThis should be a general principle of gaming.

This is what you telegraph, but if you can't telegraph it, you must be able to at least say it.<br/><br/>Easy Example: Superman is stopping a bank robbery led by Roxy Rocket, Freudian Queen of the Metropolis Sky Pirates.<br/><br/>Superman: Lay down your ray guns and come along to jail, Roxy Rocket!<br/><br/>Superman wants Roxy to surrender. He grabs some dice, rolls em, gets a result.  Roxy can look at those dice and go "wow, shit, Supes is having a really bad day and he might zap me with his laser eyes if I say no, so I GIVE IN" and toss away her ray gun and go along to jail.<br/><br/>Or Roxy might say "Nevah! You'll escort me to the city line or I'll blast this innocent little puppy with my ray gun!"<br/><br/>Roxy wants Superman to help with her getaway. She grabs some dice. She rolls. She wins.  Now Supes has to decide if he Gives In or not. And around we go until someone loses, and gets Stress inflicted on them. They don't have to do what the other side wants, but they do lose.  So for example, if Superman loses, maybe he gets Injured when she blasts him with her ray gun and she makes a daring escape (though without his help).<br/><br/>So that's easy, but don't fall into the trap of Superman saying "I want to stop her robbery!" or Roxy saying "I want to escape!" That's not the Conflict, though those things might be resolved in the end.  In a Conflict, you specifically say what you want <i>the other person to do</i>, not what you want to do.<br/><br/>Social situations are harder to handle.  Normally in a RPG we say "I want to persuade em!" and the GM yells "Roll your Persuasion" and you do or you don't.  This doesn't work so well in Smallville.  When you telegraph, you want to present them with a choice they can take <i>right now</i>, some concrete action <br/><br/>Let's say HoneyHoney wants to persuade Kiefer Sutherland to be in her music video.  Instead of saying "I want you to be in our music video next month", telegraphing something that may or may not happen, she should say something like, "Kiefer, sign this contract that says you'll be in the video" or "Kiefer, promise on your mother's grave you will be in our video" or "Kiefer, you're drunk and in the club, agree to be in our video on this youtube I'm making!"<br/><br/>This is good because it means that you don't have to concern yourself with what the other character thinks - that can still be the domain of the person playing the Lead or Feature.  It also means you're going to set up many more mechanisms for controlling untrustworthy characters to get them to do what you want them to do....which is exactly what you should have to do with untrustworthy characters.<br/><br/>Don't say things like "I want you to think I'm your best friend!"  That's more of a method to get them to do something rather than a thing itself. People can change their minds, what if they decide you're not immediately afterwards? "Fall in love with me" is also bad - what does that entail exactly? What do I "do" to do that?  Am I even able to arguably just decide that?  <br/><br/>"Kiss me, just kiss me with everything you've got!" Now that's a Conflict in the making.<br/><br/>Before you even decide how to telegraph what you want, be sure:<br/><br/>It's something you want THE OTHER PERSON...<br/><br/>....to DO...<br/><br/>...RIGHT NOW.<br/><br/>And before you know it you'll have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3YmaADISlo" rel="nofollow">new hit video</a>.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
