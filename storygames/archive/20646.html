I got an invitation for the free PDF just the other day for the digital bookshelf going live.

I think fundamentally it requires the players to really buy into the idea that you're a feuding family (literal or metaphorical) in which people sometimes make concessions. If a player decides that their character doesn't care about the other PCs, or that they just want to relentlessly dominate or kill them, then the game doesn't work.<br/>* I'm not sure I agree with 2097 about the group size issue; I think the game exaggerates the number of players required. It can work fine with GM+3.<br/>* But I kind of agree with 2097 about the settings. The default setting, iron-age cattle raiders, is a tough sell. Alternate settings are either a little dry or (whilst well-written) seem a poor fit for the feuding-family conceit of the game.<br/>* A lot of people dislike the drama-token economy, for various reasons. Some people find it superfluous, some find it hard to engage with, some find it produces perverse incentives.<br/>* Even though I think that basic mechanic is flawed, I keep coming back to the game. It can *sometimes* work very nicely, and there's a lot to like about the character setup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453248/#Comment_453248" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-13T10:22:01+00:00" title="May 13, 2016 10:22AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had some issues with GM+3 and...

It was the number of players required, and the resistance to trying it.<br/><br/>I loved listening to "The Whateleys" on Yog-Sothoth.com. You can hear the group stumbling a bit, slowly getting it, then everything picking up momentum until it's an unstoppable snowball racing down the hill. That said, they only did one session of it.<br/><br/>I played the Spanish Civil War setting once, at one of the Double Exposure conventions. This was a good compromise between "I want laser sharks!" and Robin Laws's "Start without them so you get a feel for the system." I also learned that it's a huge mistake to frame a petition such that it's a no brainer for the other party to grant it. That is, I did one as "Tell me what to do", which, unless things are set up so that the person being petitioned has reason NOT to do that, isn't really a scene.<br/><br/>The major problem I have is I want to spend more time playing it, with someone who knows what they're doing running it, and that's not likely to happen. Apart from that one convention, I'm not sure I've seen it offered at a convention, and I do understand why.<br/><br/>I wish it were otherwise. The year it came out, it was, in my arrogant opinion, the most interesting and unusual RPG in the GenCon exhibit hall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453292/#Comment_453292" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-14T09:52:50+00:00" title="May 14, 2016  9:52AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post!

Where did I see it.. maybe in my own mind?<br/>Looking through the books (I checked through both BotS and the core book) it really makes me want to play it.<br/>What I would want most of all is:<br/>Variant A<br/>1. Choose some other game.<br/>2. Make character relationships as per Hillfolk but stat them out as per the normal game.<br/>3. Do scene structure as per Hillfolk. Folks set up the scenes they want, as per Hillfok.<br/>4. A lot of the scenes will be procedural; that is OK. Use the normal game for that. Do not fear the laser sharks (in this particular variant). They are part of the awesome.<br/>5. For the dramatic scenes, use the Hillfolk drama tokens etc.<br/><br/>If not, I'd also be happy as a horse with:<br/>Variant B:<br/>1. Choose some other game.<br/>2. Make character relationships as per Hillfolk but stat them out as per the normal game.<br/>3. Do scene structure as the normal game. I.e. in D&amp;D dungeon turns, wilderness turns etc.<br/>4. Even more of the scenes will be procedural; that is still OK, even more OK even. Use the normal game for that.<br/>5. For the dramatic scenes, use the Hillfolk drama tokens etc.<br/><br/>My third option would be<br/>Variant C:<br/>1. Choose some other game.<br/>2. Make character as per the normal game.<br/>3. Do scene structure as the normal game. I.e. in D&amp;D dungeon turns, wilderness turns etc.<br/>4. For the dramatic scenes, use petitioner/granter but not drama tokens.<br/><br/>The problem for our group was that we had played so much variant C (because I had read the petitioner/granter stuff in Unframed) that they then weren't especially impressed with variants B and A. So even though variant A would've been my dream, I'll just have to keep on playing variant C. I've tried drifting it over to variant B, even either drama tokens or relationships maps would've been good for me, I don't need both even if that would be the best. But I haven't had group buy-in.<br/><br/>I'm going to try once more with the relationship/bonds for the new campaign.<br/><br/>So... petitioner/granter and all the tips in the book on how to resolve or drive such scenes, we do use and they're amazing. But players don't seek out / set up such scenes. They just happen if there's someone they have to interrogate or get missions from, for example. There's no scene framing, it's just part of the normal "game time".<br/>So the three missing pieces are drama tokens (I do believe these can be awesome), scene framing (I don't need this one particularly bad, even though I do like them, even more for GM-less games) and relationships (these grow in play anyway after a few sessions, it'd just be an accelerator to set some up before hand). Neither of these three pieces I absolutely NEED to live. I guess I'm pretty happy with my D&amp;D game as it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453313/#Comment_453313" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-15T19:23:41+00:00" title="May 15, 2016  7:23PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>I like making a lot of lists of list.

They all solve just <i>one</i> problem, and if that's not the problem you have, then they can actually get in the way. It's only with later iterations that we get more fleshed out systems.<br/><br/>So far, Hillfolk feels no different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455347/#Comment_455347" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T20:15:52+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  8:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2016 8:16PM by BeePeeGee.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a lot of fun with the original bronze age setting. Here in Europe, people are familiar with the <i>Asterix</i> comics. The technology, weapons etc were not that far off from Hillfolk, so people could relate.<br/>I liked the scene framing and loved the dramatic tension between the characters. You have to really have <i>very close</i> relationships or it doesn't work.<br/>There are a ton of interesting settings in this book, worth checking them out. I'd really prefer decent playbooks for them, though.<br/>Btw, the worst part is the layout/fonts/design of the book itself. While it is quite a decent hard-cover book, the electronic format (PDF) is to me unbearable and un-readable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455348/#Comment_455348" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T20:57:03+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  8:57PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2016 8:57PM by Paul88.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://bundleofholding.com/presents/Hillfolk2016?utm_source=Bundle+of+Holding+subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=4ecab79e03-176R92Hillfolk20160725&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_38247a319d-4ecab79e03-103403217" rel="nofollow">https://bundleofholding.com/presents/Hillfolk2016?utm_source=Bundle+of+Holding+subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=4ecab79e03-176R92Hillfolk20160725&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_38247a319d-4ecab79e03-103403217</a>I recently seen Hillfolk at Bundle of holding. <br/>With other settings thrown in, even music.<br/>Im very tempted to buy. <br/>Even for the read <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/>Here's the link above <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455359/#Comment_455359" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-28T05:49:44+00:00" title="July 28, 2016  5:49AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Didn't see the BoH, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
