Fellow fans of the comic, any thoughts? Given that, in the grand scheme, it's a blood-opera between a father and his two favorite sons, terrible yet complicatedly, precariously balanced relationships are the fulcrums at work. Between Mazikeen of the Lilim and Lucifer himself, you have a very personal-as/is-political thing going on - he's as mercurial and stingy granting succor to the Lilim as a people as he is actually showing a little affection to the ever-loyal Mazikeen herself.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243194/#Comment_243194" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T20:05:52+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  8:05PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I see the comic, an integral part of it is the urban fantasy thing where the setting and the backstory is revealed to the reader (and writers, really; I do not believe for a moment that they'd have had all the wrinkles worked out before they started writing) in small bites over time. Lucifer always knew what was up with that Chinese death pantheon, but the value for the reader in the story was discovering their culture, practices and interaction with Lucifer.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could work with this sort of thing by being explicit about the No Myth aspect of story development in the game. Have the players add backstory as it is needed, and encourage reinterpreting past events in the light of greater schemes that tie them together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243199/#Comment_243199" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T20:52:29+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  8:52PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2009 8:53PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>Sounds good to me!<br/>I think No Myth would have to be right there in the book, and known at the table, as an explicit feature of design and play. I just looked up the exact definition, and then a forum thread <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=6275.msg65338" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and it sounds pretty straightforward.<br/>Maybe some kind of teaser could happen, pre-play, that would give a chance to unleash the No Myth power of group creativity on a new pantheon or faction introduced - when someone says "oh, tie in a couple of cyclopes!" you say "what for? why them, and no one else?" and you think about it. It doesn't have to be deep - "frost giants would think it through more before <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">usurping</span> trying to usurp the throne of YHWH!"<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Lucifer always knew what was up with that Chinese death pantheon</blockquote> This makes me think about what people seem to usually say when an RPG is designed around a series or film or something that already exists - shouldn't we be able to play as major characters? To that, I say - hey, maybe half the fun could be focusing storylines around one main protagonist at a time, and that protagonist being someone who is either very knowledgeable and, chesslike, can divine his foes' schemes ten moves in advance, or someone who is, a la Elaine Belloc, someone who is the Naive Waif sort of person, surrounded by those who know better than her, but lack in luck or ability?<br/><br/>Since a great deal of scenery-chewing in <i>Lucifer</i> focuses on "Oh yeah? Well, I know more than you about..." (see: any scene at the Lux), maybe stories focused on the sharing of knowledge could be a way of practicing No Myth - take the group of players and split them up into A and B groups. Group A has a set of ideas they want to share/show off/whatever, and they will be the bog-standard players (albeit very empowered ones). Group B will be their collaborators - those who help Make It Happen, either by playing dumb and being Ms. Belloc or by doing more traditional GM stuff (but in a very Fifth Business/Ron Edwards article on Narrativism kind of way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243209/#Comment_243209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T22:49:49+00:00" title="November 22, 2009 10:49PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stories with strong central characters like Lucifer are more often than not <i>about</i> the central character. Lucifer is a very simple guy who doesn't really have that many problems in his life (the thing about standing up to God is grandstanding typical of American comics, not a genuine conflict). Lucifer instigates strife, but is rarely touched by it personally. The interesting characters with problems are Elaine and other humans who get mixed up with Lucifer.<br/><br/>Given the above, one way to go about something like this is to make Lucifer an explicit GMPC or group-controlled NPC - we already know his story and what he's about, so what we really want is for him to hang around, comment on things, maybe help the real protagonists when things get tough (of course solely because his interests just happen to coincide with theirs at this point in time) and so on. I wrote a game sort of like this around the beginning of the decade, the premise was that the players to take turns playing Conan, while everybody else would play the various hanger-ons. Tricky, but that sort of set-up has potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243262/#Comment_243262" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T09:02:47+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  9:02AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would In a Wicked Age work, with someone playing Lucifer each session?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243317/#Comment_243317" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T18:10:14+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  6:10PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That'd actually be a notably good fit, I'd say!
