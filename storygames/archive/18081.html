This thread is for my findings and any discussion of the findings you want to have.<br/><br/>First, here's a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiTXEu9fb8c2dEd5WTl1ZXVaNTFpdE1XLUdxT0t4cVE&amp;usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">the raw data.</a><br/><br/>All told, we studied 27 years of modules - 108 scenarios.<br/><br/>Across all years, we were able to identify 23 scenarios that railroaded, 5 that used a magician's force ("no matter what the characters choose to do they receive this information"), and 12 chokepoints ("if the investigators don't go here and do/discover this the scenario ends.)  <br/><br/>We used the most expansive methodology possible for identifying railroads (since story hyphen games dot com responds to railroading like vampires do to the touch of all that is holy), had a somewhat tighter methodology for identifying chokepoints, and tightest of all was the magician's force since everyone agreed that multiple paths to information is just good scenario design.<br/><br/>We were very expansive with what we considered a "scenario".  Campaign books 100 pages long were considered as 1 scenario, along with mini-scenarios that were only 2-3 pages long.  <br/><br/>This means that around 21 percent of Call of Cthulhu modules railroad.  My interpretation of this result is that railroading has been an issue for Call of Cthulhu modules but it would not be accurate to make a generalization that said "Call of Cthulhu modules railroad."  If you picked a Call of Cthulhu module at random, there's around a 1 in 5 chance that you would encounter some railroading, so people who have played a bit of the game and think that's how it goes are not wrong; their experience has just been of that part of the game.<br/><br/>Around 37 percent of Call of Cthulhu modules has at least one of these problems.  (Some may have been counted twice if they had more than one problem but this is pretty rare.)<br/><br/>Another theory we wanted to test was whether there were time periods that were more or less railroady.  Surely the despised 1990s would be the worst.  Nope.  Here's a chart.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0AiTXEu9fb8c2dEd5WTl1ZXVaNTFpdE1XLUdxT0t4cVE&amp;oid=1&amp;zx=nnco5ovfaouq"/><br/><br/>I am bad at Google Drive's chart maker, so:<br/><br/>Blue is the sum of all scenarios examined.<br/>Red is Railroading<br/>Orange is Magician's Force<br/>Green is Chokepoints<br/><br/>The two big spikes in non-problematic scenarios analyzed occur from 1991-1992 and then again in 1997.<br/><br/>Some interesting facts:<br/><br/>The worst year for railroading in which we examined more than two scenarios is 1988, where 2 of 5 scenarios examined had railroading.  (Our one 2007 scenario was railroaded and 1 of 2 scenarios from 1993 were railroaded.)<br/><br/>The best year in which we examined more than two scenarios is 1997, when only 14 percent of published scenarios had any kind of problem.<br/><br/>Of the years with 10 or more scenarios examined, none had more than 25 percent railroading.  Of those years, the least railroaded year was 1991, with only 8 percent of scenarios classified as railroading.<br/><br/>I'm still collecting data in the other thread, but this seems to be a pretty solid set to reach conclusions from.<br/><br/>Unlike with my Vampire thread, I didn't have a clear thesis on what Call of Cthulhu modules were like - I remembered seeing some problems but also remembered experiencing some amazing stuff, so running the numbers was really educational to me.  It definitely shows that there's some stuff to keep an eye out for, but overall it doesn't seem terrible.<br/><br/>Hopefully it is useful to you too!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408156/#Comment_408156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T11:47:00+00:00" title="March  5, 2013 11:47AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice work!
