Its character  advancement is actually pretty interesting.<br/><br/>You track different types of advancement:  Advancement Points which are earned from skill use and can be used to improve non weapon skills.  And Experience which comes from attendance and completing adventures and can be used to improve weapon skills or "level up"<br/><br/>Advancement Points are clever because they tie into the interesting way skills are done in the game.  The skills are arranged in a grid of 3 columns listed underneath one of the three attributes.  Each row is a category of related skills.  Advancement points are earned by row and each point earned in that row requires a progressively more impressive skill use, although the points can then be spent on any skill.<br/><br/>Leveling up is also interesting because there are essentially two different level progressions Wisdom and Valour.  Both help you socially impress important people in the word.  Wisdom gives you special abilities similar to Feats and Valour gives you special gear (e.g. Frodo acquired a Mithril Shirt after leveling up his Valour).<br/><br/>In addition you can improve your standing by acquiring and spending treasure which makes you a progressively more important person in your community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358983/#Comment_358983" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T18:41:10+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  6:41PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The latest episode of my podcast, <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a>, is about 'the One Ring', and includes excerpts of the game we played.

Every rule (or at leas like 90% of them)...9 pages.  But it took me probably 15 hours all in trying to assemble those 9 pages from where they were scattered across 2 books.

Although I have made a few tweaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nRAW encounters last until Tolerance is 0 and Tolerance goes down with each failed social roll.  That pretty much allowed encounters to last forever, or at least long past the point of being interesting.  So I switched it up so that tolerance is the maximum number of rolls you get period, with successful rolls gaining you Boons (swiped from Skywalker from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14964" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>) and extra successful rolls not costing Tolerance.  That strikes a nice balance where the encounter draws to a close mechanically right around the same time it feels natural to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted folks to level up faster (my campaigns these days don't typically go into the dozens of session) so I created additional XP awards borrowed from Burning Wheel and a couple of extras (like XP to the player who recaps the last session, and an XP if you get wounded).  That puts folks solidly in level up territory after the first adventure (3 sessions-ish).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll likely still need to have read the books to understand how it all gets used.

One of the most unfortunately put together books ever.  I see what they were trying to do...give the players just the rules needed for players to play without burdening them with LM stuff...and they clearly wanted the LM to have access to everything but didn't want to duplicate rules...but they just wound up with a jumbled up mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately for me War of the Ring is IMO one of the most extraordinary board game designs of all time...in large part because he clearly GETS Middle Earth thematically in a way that MERPs never even got close to.  So I wanted -- REALLY wanted -- to see what he'd do with an RPG.  So because of my previous experience with the designers genius, I cut him WAY more slack than I normally would.  WotR had a horrendously organized manual too.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrary to John...I think he hit it out of the park.  It is an extraordinary design, simple in execution but with enough moving parts to enjoy actually using the system rather than ignoring it.  Rolling a d12 with special faces combined with a pool of d6s combined with spending points to add attribute bonuses is deliciously nuanced (so much more interesting than "roll a d20 vs a target number" which I find horrendously boring and is the biggest disappointment I have with Adventurer Conqueror King).  But yet, so intuitive and thematically powerful that I've found it to be amazing in play.  Spending hope to succeed on a roll, knowing that puts you ever closer to flirting with shadow...can't get much more Tolkien that that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe combat system completely abandons the old "based on tactical minis" paradigm without abandoning combat systems.  Instead it bases the way the combat rules work on the way combat works in fantasy novels.  Stances are an ingeniously simple way of building tactical positioning into the game without needing 5 foot paces or attacks of opportunity.  In the fight we ran on Friday there was just enough shuffling around of stances to see that it definitely had impact without being tedious.  By breaking down the back and forth around stances he neatly avoided the "all players go, all monsters go" methods which seem artificial as well as cumbersome initiative systems which mix things up at the expense of record keeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've got a system where it will take 2-3 normal average hits to put down a mob opponent, but one good solid hit from a good fighter, or a lucky blow from anyone can put them down in a single blow, without needing to resort to kludges like "minion rules".  You've got PC survivability such that 1 good hit from a troll puts the fear of "Oh Shit I'm in Trouble" into the stoutest of mail clad dwarves...but ultimately its actually fairly unlikely for a character to out right die before having a chance to flee, without needing complicated wound levels or that crazy injury scale in BW that I've never really figured out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts definitely one of the best games I've played in a coon's age.  I only hope it sells well enough for the follow up sets to get released.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359272/#Comment_359272" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T09:18:54+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the sheet, Ralph!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359281/#Comment_359281" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T09:42:46+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:42AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>I've been looking at a couple of replacement systems since the discussions of the last few days.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat are you trying to replace?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359288/#Comment_359288" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T09:56:06+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:56AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2012 9:57AM by Dionysus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically there are a number of players who have very set ideas about Storyteller - namely associated with the World of Darkness setting in general.<br><br>There is a general dislike of the high "whiff" factor, where is is pretty hard to succeed at anything, even with large dicepools. That can be helped by changing the TN to something lower - but it was also in exalted etc - there is little you can do to "soften" the randomness.<br><br>Also the rules for morality/wisdom/whatever..

I've been tag-team running (trading off GM duties with another person in my group) The One Ring since August, I just started running a Mouse Guard game 2 weeks ago after having a terrible experience with the rules when they first came out, and I just bought Anima Prime last week and am trying to get my head around the mechanics right now.<br/><br/>I think I need to sit down and actually play Anima Prime for the rules to gel for me.  I get the general idea, but the interaction of the various dice pools/types seems confusing on reading.  I'm sure it will click once I see it in action.  I'm from the Pong generation rather than the Final Fantasy generation, but I love the visuals of anime and Japanese console games, so really want to give Anima Prime a shot.<br/><br/>We have really been enjoying our One Ring game.  Like Ralph, we are enjoying the rewards system, and I love the way the combat stances system gives us tactical decisions to make without minis and grids.  I have an actual play of our earlier games with a little rules analysis <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?592009-The-One-Ring-Up-the-Reeking-River" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which might be helpful.  We've been playtesting some stuff for the  game, and a system based on Skywalker's tweaks to the Encounters (social) system has been adopted as "official", so you'll see future book using it.  This is the longest run of a single game we've had in quite a while, and everyone is still enthusiastic about keeping it going for the foreseeable future.  Our characters are now up in the 45 experience range, and are pretty heroic.<br/><br/>For Mouse Guard, the "key" that unlocked the game for me was the idea that failure is good.  You want your mice to fail, both to create a better story and for purely mechanical benefits.  Once that clicked, I've really enjoyed  the two sessions I've run so far, and the players have seemed to really enjoy it, even when their characters were being hosed.<br/><br/>Choosing between any of these is tough, I like them all.  If cash is an issue, you can get Anime Prime's free version from their website.  Christian can confirm, but I'm pretty sure that the only difference between the free and pay version is pretty layout and illustrations.  The One Ring is cheap on Amazon (I'm actually selling one of the extra copies I bought at Gencon on there even cheaper).  Mouse Guard is affordable as the hardback rulebook, but the boxed set is pretty sweet, and I find that having all of the various cards to track weapons, conditions, conflict actions, etc. really gives the game a tactile element that the players enjoy.<br/><br/>Sorry for not being any help on choosing one over the others.  For people more used to trad games rather than story games, One Ring is probably the best candidate.<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359369/#Comment_359369" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T13:59:17+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  1:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great to hear about the Skywalker tweak being officially adopted.

I refer to it as Anima Prime's version of "Ox Body Charm" (from Exalted). First time you play AP, Do NOT give that ability to antagonists except for maybe a single boss battle where 1-2 antags have it to a limited degree.  I've played one-shots and mini campaigns, and learned through trial and error that it slows combats to hell, and should be used sparingly (boss fights, MAYBE up to two antagonist enemies per session).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359495/#Comment_359495" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T07:51:52+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  7:51AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2012 7:52AM by Valamir.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Hmmm.

It was a huge flop at our table.</blockquote>\nI had the advantage of reading John's earlier criticism of the game and learning from that.  So I was extra careful in how I used the journey rules especially.   I think the biggest danger playing One Ring for the first time is to approach the Journey and Encounter (and even Combat) rules too literally.  You need to approach them from the angle of using them as a structure that back stops the fiction (i.e. the role play, the free form, the whatever), not as a replacement for it.  If you just roll your way through a Journey it will be an uninteresting grind.  If you treat encounters like a version of 4E skill challenges where every player just takes a turn rolling a skill it will feel detached and artificial.<br/><br/>So instead (and I think this is how the game was designed to be used...he just fell into the all too common trap of assuming everyone would just do it) you need to use the systems (journey and encounter especially) for pacing.  In a "normal" traditional game where meetings with important NPCs are resolved purely by roleplaying you have players talking and the GM talking for the NPCs and you have a back and forth interesting dialog.  But how do you judge whether the NPC's responses are favorable or unfavorable to a particular player statement?  How do you judge when to have the NPCs spill the beans and when to have them angrily refuse?  Most importantly, how do you judge when the meeting has run past the point of being interesting and needs to just be wrapped up?  <br/><br/>In traditional play...GM fiat alone determines those things.  As a GM I find such tasks to be exhausting and require far more prep than I care to do to pull off believably.  As a player I find such uses of fiat to all to easily be the means by which the GM railroads events, by giving easily those bits he wants players to seize on and adamantly refusing those bits he doesn't.  In One Ring, you still want to let yourself have those interesting back and forth dialogs, what the encounter rules do...is give me, as GM, mechanical support.  I know when the NPC will spill the beans because I put it third on the list of Boons, so after the players roll successfully 3 times...that's good enough.  I know when its appropriate to have and NPC respond unfavorably, because the player failed the roll they were making.  And I know when the meeting is effectively over because the Tolerance hits zero, whether all of the Boons have been granted or not.  All of which means, I don't need to do much to run the the encounter other than scribble a few hasty notes about boons, tolerances, and what approach the NPC will most likely respond favorably to.  Basically, it lets me encode a stat block for a roleplaying encounter which helps keep me on track.  But I also know that if the players take the roleplaying in a specific direction it may well make more sense to award the boons out of order, or to discard some that no longer apply, or to invent new ones to account for a tact I hadn't anticipated.  But the system gives me the framework for doing that easily.  It backs up the roleplaying.  And while I know that Boons are a player hack, I suspect that that hack is really just an explicit codification of the way the designer played but failed to write down properly.<br/><br/>Journey is much the same.  You are describing a long arduous trek through the wilderness, you don't want that to become "role a bunch of dice...repeatedly".  First you want to prep the journey in advance.  It only takes a few minutes but before the party takes one step on the road you should already know how many fatigue rolls are needed and what the TNs are and how many corruption rolls are needed and what the TNs are.  You also want to know when you'll be making those rolls (on the third day they'll come to the brackish pool with the bones from the old battle...that's where I'll have them make the corruption check.  You should prep a few hazards along the way that might be triggered by bad travel rolls that fit with the theme of the journey.  If the journey itself is the meat of the adventure, you should use the sample adventure in the book as a guide and intersperse encounter along with the raw journey rolls.  The sample adventure has several (3?) great examples of using the Prolonged Action rules as a pacing mechanic for when to trigger one encounter vs. another.  <br/><br/>And when you call for the players to make their rolls, follow up.  Everytime you make a fatigue roll, don't just let them roll and record numbers...pick a player and ask "How are you feeling?", or "The elf looks as fresh as the day you set out...what do you think about that" (given an elf character who hasn't failed a travel roll), or "the Hobbit looks about ready to keel over from a load much too heavy for him, do you offer to help him out".  (when there's a hobbit character who's failed every one) or whatever other question comes to mind.  Corruption rolls are even easier.  You REALLY want to play up the brooding and the suspicion, and the despair.  Pick a player who failed their corruption test and ask them to describe what emotions they're struggling with.  One that kicked off a whole little sub plot in our adventure (running the sample from the book) was when both dwarves failed the corruption check called for by finding the Stone of Dain.  I turned to one and said "Dobbin has that stone, the stone that by all rights should be yours, what are you going to do about that?" as a result much of the rest of the adventure was spiced up by Borin brooding over how he was going to get that stone away from his fellow.  <br/><br/>Combat is a little different, because, as with most combat systems, the rules have primacy.  But you'll want to approach it more like you were writing a combat scene for a novel vs. building a D&amp;D style encounter.  In a novel, the description of what is happening will bounce from character to character and you'll generally see both how the enemy is attacking and how that character responds before bouncing out to another character...and that's how it works in One Ring.  Each flurry of action resolves both the attacks against and the attack of 1 character before moving on to the next.  Often in novels you'll have a dangerous attack almost kill a character before another character leaps to their aid and rescues them.  That's what you get with the Defensive Stance and its matching special action.  Sometimes in novels you'll get the action staying with one character for a longer series, that's what you get when a character shifts from defensive stance (and going at the end of the last round) to forward stance (and going first in the next round).<br/><br/>As long as you take the time to describe the swings, and the misses, and the maneuvers the way it would be written in a novel (glossing over the boring ones...slowing down to "bullet time" for the amazing ones) you'll find the system sings along effectively.  It takes a bit of practice.  The second fight we ran (with the party outnumbered 3:1 by generally inferior foes) drug a little bit.  I suspect that was largely because it was only our second fight, and the party stumbled into the big climactic battle straight away, rather than having a few warm up engagements first.<br/><br/>All of which, in my ideal world, the designer would have written into the instructions of how to play the game effectively.  But he didn't, which is irritating as fuck.  But I think if you get passed that the system really has a number of real gems to enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359521/#Comment_359521" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T09:07:12+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  9:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Valamir - thank you for that!

I refer to it as Anima Prime's version of "Ox Body Charm" (from Exalted). First time you play AP, Do NOT give that ability to antagonists except for maybe a single boss battle where 1-2 antags have it to a limited degree. I've played one-shots and mini campaigns, and learned through trial and error that it slows combats to hell, and should be used sparingly (boss fights, MAYBE up to two antagonist enemies per session).</blockquote>\nI think you are referring to Knockback (Adventurer's Book pg 160). It is not available for antagonists and is a PC only ability as written.<br/><br/>Many of the rules in TOR are assymetrical this way. For example, only PCs choose stance, roll for battlefield advantage, choose to make called shots etc. Antagonists on the other hand have their own abilities such as Hate, a single Attribute level and are not Wearied in the normal way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359612/#Comment_359612" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T13:01:11+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  1:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>Yeah that's a ton of "system building" you've tacked on to the rules.

I do find The One Ring to be an interesting RPG in that covers a wide range of diverse play styles. Though the rules are frustratingly vague at times, there is flexibility given in how to approach system elements that results in it being one of the few RPGs that seems to be capable of satisfying everything from hard core trad RPGers and to hard core story gamers. <br/><br/>It does lose people on the far fringes as it doesn't stay true to either end of the spectrum TBH. I have seen those who come at it as a story game and find elements like the creation of the Fellowship to be pointless and Journeys to be just a series of dice rolls. Likewise, I have seen those who come at it as a simulationist traditional game and find elements like the combat to be assymetrical, Traits to be meta-gamey and Journeys providing too much narrative influence in the hands of the players. <br/><br/>Though many of these criticisms are accurate from the perspective of the person saying them, I think the very fact that we have those such a range of people giving the game a try is a testament to the RPG's breadth. It won't suit everyone, no RPG will. But it seems to be well received by many.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359638/#Comment_359638" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T15:21:38+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  3:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Andy was talking about Anima Prime there <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And while I don't usually set Defense high for enemies, if you do, there's always creating goals to lower it.

Not to diminish Valamir's great work too, but there is a lot of good design in TOR that's being used in his example.<br/><br/>On saying that, such assembly is to an extent true of many RPGs traditionally. Going back to my point above, I have seen quite a few gamers who prefer the traditional RPG approach criticising TOR for being too prescriptive about what the GM does. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>Well, the license is also an automatic draw.</blockquote>\nIts a draw, but most of the stuff I was commenting on was people's reaction to the mechanics. For example, I haven't seen the kind of breadth of appeal with RPGs with even bigger licences, like Star Wars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359663/#Comment_359663" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T17:26:40+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  5:26PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I didn't mean the license comment to be a slam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359692/#Comment_359692" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T20:12:36+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  8:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2012 9:08PM by Valamir.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I am cutting One Ring more slack in that department than I have other games that I've torn into for ineffective texts.  I'd say that's a combination of 1) how truly amazing War of the Ring was despite its textual flaws, 2) how absolutely perfectly the rules that are in One Ring say "Middle Earth" and not "Rune Quest with Middle Earth place names on the map", and 3) because those rules really are super innovative and super effective.<br/><br/>But I also don't think I'm adding as much as you suggest.  There's a metric ton of good game mastering advice for the Lore Master in the LMG and while the specific techniques I adopted above aren't specifically mentioned (that I recall) they're certainly within the context of that advice and able to be extrapolated from it.  I don't think it requires GM awesome sauce to run...in fact, I'm SUPER rusty as a GM.  I think that any GM who's passionate about Middle Earth and between the books and movies understands the sort of episode that sees Boromir lusting after the ring can reasonably come up with a way to link the mechanics to that.<br/><br/>A far cry from my ideal to be sure, but certainly no worse (and actually much better) than most traditional games in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359698/#Comment_359698" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T21:07:19+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  9:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            War of the Ring is my favorite boardgame of the many I own.
