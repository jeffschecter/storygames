When I asked one person in particular, what would they find interesting in a game, the answer was "NPCs that are awesome! Ones that a character can really say 'I wanna be like that guy!' or 'I really want to kill that guy!'" After thinking about it, and thinking about it some more, with a little pondering mixed in, I started to wonder if it was actually possible to instill the NPC awesomeness that we learn through personal experience, trial, error, and good role-playing, into some kind of set of guidelines that would help the fledgling GM? In essence, making an "NPC How-To" guide? I mean, it's one thing having a list of wants and moves, a la Apocalypse World, but it is another thing entirely to take a few words representing an NPC and turn it into a major character. Or is it?<br/>So, anyway, let's see what the mighty consiousness that is Story Games can come up with!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
