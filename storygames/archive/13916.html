Everything working well so far and I foresee playing the system quite often.<br/><br/>Are there any suggestions on how to resolve a situation in which 2 PCs are in opposite sides? Like when, one PC wants to seduce another that doesn't want to be seduced; a duel of magic. or swords; one wants to convince another to do something they would rather not.<br/><br/>In Archipelago 2007, this would be easy since there is 50% chance of a positive outcome what would put the PCs on equal foot. But, in Archipelago 2009, the chance of a positive but often conditional outcome is higher than a negative one.<br/><br/>Does it matter? Is the conditional nature of most outcomes enough to make the difference irrelevant? Should the opposing PC be the one interpreting the card (instead of an unrelated PC/player)? Or, would it be better to just make the odds 50/50 in this case?<br/><br/>Thanks                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315374/#Comment_315374" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T17:33:46+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  5:33PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although it does get a little weird sometimes, I don't think it matters. I'd clearly define what the person who made the "not so easy!" statement wants and resolve it around those terms, with a third player narrating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
