Blood responds to the enchantment of the Feywild. Just as the native creatures of the Fey embody extremes of passions and power, visitors begin to behave as pure, truer versions of themselves. Bold heroes become reckless, friends become lovers, and rivalries devolve into knife fights. Although adventurers never love control, they must constantly fight the Feywild's call to the wild, the free, and unrestrained within.</blockquote>\nOMG, right? A journey through the Feywild should so totally let you play that out! But with 4E, rules as written, you'll always have the player who insists that his character can just shrug it off.<br/><br/>FATE Aspects seems <em>perfect</em> for this kind of situation, but compels only work because you've got Fate points. Do you think that Action Points could serve this purpose? Or would Action Points moving around so freely break the game? What if Action Points could do other things, like give you a +2 bonus to a roll, or let you reroll? I suspect that would create too much of a problem.  <a href="http://rpgdiehard.blogspot.com/2008/10/benny-economy-in-savage-worlds.html?showComment=1225522320000#c1889478972977477339" rel="nofollow">A commenter</a> on <a href="http://rpgdiehard.blogspot.com/2008/10/benny-economy-in-savage-worlds.html" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a> about bennies in <em>Savage Worlds</em> agrees that Action Points wouldn't work for this, and instead suggests inventing a new currency like "Hero Points" to serve this purpose. Since even the DMG advises a +2/-2 modifier for any miscellaneous factor not otherwise covered, spending a point for that seems like a good fit. Perhaps you can also use one to get combat advantage on someone (something any rogue would love)?<br/><br/>I can't say I feel entirely comfortable with either option: using Action Points seems like it might break the game, whereas inventing something new seems too complex.

Instead of saving their APs to help with the big bad guy, what you are very likely to find is that they'll have enough to spend one on nearly every encounter and that means that they can really stack up the damage in a single round. Mike Mearls talks about the AP problems they had in playtesting in one of the GenCon podcasts (I think it was The Tome)."<br/><br/>This is a non-issue, given that a major and consistent concern about 4E fights is that they are too long. Making a fight shorter is not unbalancing, provided that the relative contribution of each player to that victory remains equitable. If the fight lasts 15 minutes rather than 45 minutes, then you get to have more fights in a night. Given the math behind 4E, though, I cannot imagine that freer access to APs would turn a 10-round fight into a 1-round fight. You can easily test this: suppose your party has unlimited access to APs, and see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246845/#Comment_246845" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T11:13:17+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 11:13AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can actually just use D6's as tokens, an "use" them to add a d6 to any roll.

As stated, unless one character is especially built towards using APs effectively, then everyone would benefit roughly equally.  Actually, since humans benefit most from APs, you could have a situation where humans are more susceptible to the Feywild's call than other PCs are, like how humans are more susceptible to the lure of the One Ring.

That makes it very tempting to take an extended rest after each encounter, so you use your daily powers in each encounter, which I know from experience makes even the toughest encounter a cake-walk.<br/><br/>Secondly, you can still only use one Action Point per encounter. And actually, since you start with one Action Point at the end of an extended rest ... wow, yeah, the more I think about it, the more broken it seems.<br/><br/>This would make it imperative to keep the party from resting for very long. I'll have to have someone or something on their tail at all times, or a clock always ticking, something in-game to keep them moving from one encounter to the next without an extended rest, because I've taken away any mechanical reason to keep going. Or, pin other benefits to milestones. (Like what, I wonder?)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>You can actually just use D6's as tokens, an "use" them to add a d6 to any roll.

But, as Mr. Teapot said, I like it precisely because it gives players a choice, and more importantly, a <em>meaningful</em> choice. As pure, freeform RP, they have every reason to resist, because I've asked them to do something foolish, or something that will compromise them or weaken them somehow. You might accept if you as a player want to see what happens to your character, but does driving a wedge between player and character motivations like that help the game? I don't know that it does. FATE's Aspects, on the other hand, give it a lot of the same logic that tempts us in real life. We only have so much willpower to resist so many things that tempt us; do I indulge now, despite the ramifications, or do I try to hold strong? Player and character motivations can align, even when you you take the GM up on the offer of that compel, because you haven't just screwed your character over without any benefit. You've made a calculated choice.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>Actually, since humans benefit most from APs, you could have a situation where humans are more susceptible to the Feywild's call than other PCs are, like how humans are more susceptible to the lure of the One Ring.

If everyone does this under the best circumstances, they essentially get an extra turn. Combat is thus shortened by 1 round. I don't see how shortening all combats by 1 round is particularly problematic.<br/><br/>The extended-rest vs. milestone issue is a non-issue, since it is always advantageous to take an extended rest if the fiction allows it and you have Dailies that are actually better than your At-Wills and Encounters. The players already get more AP by taking lots of extended rests vs. shooting for Milestones. If anything, having more AP decreases the relative benefit of an extended rest, since getting one more of a thing is a beneficial in proportion to the thing's scarcity. As APs become less scarce, the advantage of getting one more AP from an extended rest is decreased.<br/><br/>Anyway, the thing is to actually run the numbers. If you see a 20% decrease in average combat time in this case for your actual party, then the only question that remains is whether you're okay with this or whether you take Mr. Teapot's advice and increase the XP budget. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, though, making everyone in the party more powerful is unlikely to upset your players, even if some benefit more than others. Remember the truism of PvE vs. PvP: In PvP, a buff to one is a nerf to the rest.

From the PHB:\n<blockquote><cite>Page 286</cite><br/>\u2726 You start with 1 action point. (Monsters usually have <br/>no action points.) <br/>\u2726 You gain 1 action point when you reach a milestone <br/>(page 259). <br/>\u2726 After you take an extended rest (page 263), you lose <br/>any unspent action points, but you start fresh with 1 <br/>action point.</blockquote>\nThus, since you can only spend 1 AP per encounter, taking an extended rest after every encounter ensures the maximum AP usage possible, barring feats or other abilities that might grant extra uses. Combined with the refresh of Dailies and other limited-use resources that come with an extended rest, this is the source of the "5 Minute Workday" paradigm in 4E. Thus, as you say, the only effective deterrent to taking an extended rest after every battle is in-fiction consequences, or (less charitably) GM fiat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246971/#Comment_246971" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T18:03:09+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  6:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite><br/>The reward for Extended Rest isn't APs, it's refreshing Daily powers.

Perhaps, in earlier design iterations, APs flowed more readily in and out of the player's pool.

I'm with you here as well regarding the carrots and sticks, although we might also consider this: why would we want player characters to do crazy shit? It seems to me that it's equally valid to see them take smart preparations ("I'll enter Feywild blind to avoid its influence." or whatever) and avoid any problems. Or, we might take the description at face value and accept that the Feywild won't normally make player characters go crazy - perhaps it'll just give a +2 to charm magic or something.<br/><br/>I suppose that I don't see Compels working here too well because I don't quite understand the desire to have characters enact player-originated crazy shit in D&amp;D - what's the point of having the players provide both the adversity and the solutions? Fourth edition is mucho confusing as to what you should be doing with it, of course, so maybe it makes sense if you're not working from a challenge-based paradigm at all. I've been thinking lately that I should write a blog post or some such about the GNS agenda of 4th edition D&amp;D, it seems so confusing at times. I'm actually half convinced that the dominant paradigm of the game is actually genre-focus Sim (with dungeoneering as the genre), and all these Story Games threads are just efforts at drifting that into something resembling Narrativism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246990/#Comment_246990" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T20:45:21+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  8:45PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2009 8:42AM by Eric.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: your statements are entirely reasonable, and I can do nothing but agree.

Maybe 4E's campaign mode is genre Sim and its short form mode is friendly-tournament Gamism? Labels aside, I think those are two very popular play modes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246993/#Comment_246993" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T21:08:45+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  9:08PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick note:<br/><br/><i>"Once per Day: After you finish an extended rest, you have to wait 12 hours before you can begin another one."</i><br/><br/>...is the in-game mechanic that prevents the '5-minute workday.'<br/><br/>Any well-designed group of encounters is going to give the PCS a reason to keep moving anyway; the worry about multiple extended rests is an artifact of older version of D&amp;D that I don't think present nearly as much of a problem in the current iteration.<br/><br/>I have found that APs are a very nice reward for between-game writing. It means that the players with time ge a little bonus but not one that directly affects advancement, a carrot, rather than, say, an xp reward, which though it looks like a carrot, is really a stick for the PCs who don't want to (or can't... one of our players' wives had a baby just a couple months ago...) do extra work between games.<br/><br/>Has anyone thought of using the Skill Challenge mechanics for this? I'd need to think about how that might work, but they're the closest thing to non-combat narrative control over the PCs that a DM has short of plain fiat.<br/><br/>From a Story Game perspective, this effect sounds very much like what <i>Summerland</i> works towards as a core mechanic of the setting. I love the look of it, and have read through but not played it.

In that scenario, you would have two 5-minute encounters per day rather than one, and hence a '10-minute-workday.' With proper timing, a hypothetical '15-minute-workday' could be possible.<br><br>I have yet to see any hard-coded core rules that prevent this, but you are correct insomuch as 4E focuses more strongly on skirmish battles rather than meticulous dungeon exploration. This creates a somewhat easier in-fiction environment to support fast-paced encounters. Note that many official Delve Night events must be completed under a number of set restrictions, both real-time restrictions and in-game restrictions, that prevent the use of the 5-minute workday. That's something they had to explicitly rule in for the Delve Night events. <br/><br/>The bottom line is you need in-fiction motivation, new rules, or some motivation around the table (let's see how many fights we can do in a row!

The conservative player stays towards the the middle, gaining only minor benefits and penalties from the Feywild while working to avoid further risk. The aggressive player goes for the big payoff, despite much higher risk, and enjoys greater benefits while operating under increasingly heavy penalties. <br/><br/>For example, you have a 0-4 rating. 0 means you are utteraly banal, and the Feywild attempts to reject you with extreme prejudice. 4 means you are being of the Feywild utterly, and would have to be forcibly extracted. You roll your rating in Wild Dice (d6's) on one type of d20 roll per point of rating, adding the highest to your d20 result. Thus, a player with rating 3 would roll 3d6 on three different types of d20 roll, say Attacks, Saves, and Skill Checks, and apply the highest of the 3d6 to the results of these rolls (I believe that a rating of 4 lets you apply your Wild Dice to all possible d20 rolls). If you fail the roll, however, then the DM gets 1 AP for every Wild Dice that came up as a "1." The DM may use these APs against you only, but may apply them to any Feywild NPC. In additional to their normal applications, Feywild NPCs may have additional ways to spend APs.<br/><br/>Anyway, just an idea. The basic result is that a person with rating 1 gains a minor benefit at minor risk. A person with rating 3 gains a bigger benefit at a bigger risk. Failing tasks also becomes tied to the Feywild itself, which would presumably be worked into the fiction.<br/><br/>You might need to have more separate categories of d20 roll. Perhaps At-Will attacks and Encounter/Daily attacks could be separated, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247075/#Comment_247075" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T09:13:51+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  9:13AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, yet another thought:  The Concordance mechanism from Artifacts.

If anything, 4E has taken some steps to alleviate that (even if it obviously hasn't totally solved it). Action points played a role in that: if you're in your second encounter of the day, you might want to take an extended rest to recover your dailies, but you get another AP from the milestone, which gives you some reason to keep pressing on. Encounter and at-will powers also helped address this, since it meant that magic-users could keep on going.<br/><br/>But even with this, as you point out, there's not much reason to <em>not</em> take an extended rest after each encounter, in terms of mechanics.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>I'm a fan of carrots, like APs, XP, etc. If you use a stick - resist the influence or do crazy shit! - then my incentive is to try to arrange things such that I never do crazy shit. A journey in the Feywild thus may actually produce less crazy shit than in a normal game. In contrast, if you use a carrot - succumb to the influence and do crazy shit to get prizes! - then my incentive is to do lots of crazy shit. A journey in the Feywild thus is more likely to be remembered as being batshit crazy compared to a normal game.</blockquote>\nAgreed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I suppose that I don't see Compels working here too well because I don't quite understand the desire to have characters enact player-originated crazy shit in D&amp;D - what's the point of having the players provide both the adversity and the solutions? Fourth edition is mucho confusing as to what you should be doing with it, of course, so maybe it makes sense if you're not working from a challenge-based paradigm at all</blockquote>\nI definitely see 4E as overcoming a series of challenges. The Feywild presents a particular set of challenges. I watched <em>Spirited Away</em> finally a few nights ago. Now, if I leave a bunch of delicious food out in a 4E game, my players know every bit as well as my wife &amp; I knew watching the movie that eating it would be a bad idea. But how many fairy stories start off with that kind of temptation? It's not a challenge to ask you whether or not somebody else should give in to temptation, so to make it a challenge, you've got to make it tempting not just for the character, but for the player. If you can do that, the Feywild becomes a challenge of illusions and temptations like it should be, not just a nest of traps that you, as a player, can spot pretty obviously, because you know that you're playing a game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>Any well-designed group of encounters is going to give the PCS a reason to keep moving anyway; the worry about multiple extended rests is an artifact of older version of D&amp;D that I don't think present nearly as much of a problem in the current iteration.</blockquote>\nThey've done some things to alleviate it, though my current campaign has suffered from it. Then again, I try to make each night's story a more-or-less self-contained story, or at least a recognizable chapter in the story. Now that we're in the paragon tier, we may not have time to do more than one or two combats in a night. As a result, we don't see a lot of milestones.<br/><br/>In this new campaign I'm planning (which will have a lot of Feywild, hence this thread), I'm planning on (a) finding ways to make combats shorter (leaning pretty heavily on some of the ideas in DMG2 for that), and (b) getting more comfortable with ending the night mid-dungeon.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>Has anyone thought of using the Skill Challenge mechanics for this? I'd need to think about how that might work, but they're the closest thing to non-combat narrative control over the PCs that a DM has short of plain fiat.</blockquote>\nYes! It seems to scream for a skill challenge, but I don't know what it would be.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>Yeah, treating the Feywild as one big-ass Artifact might be feasible.</blockquote>\nDuuuuude, you just blew my fruggin' mind.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tork</cite>This would be a pretty substantial change to make just to awesomify the Feywild, but if it were me, I'd switch to using the<a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/index.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20</a>system (which bolts Shadow of Yesterday-style keys onto D&amp;D), and ask the players to create temporary Feywild keys that tie in with that effect.  It's a carrot and a flag.</blockquote>\nYeah, I pitched Sweet20 to them, and it was unanimously rejected.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>I introduced a thing in 4E called +1 tokens.</blockquote>\nKind of like the "Hero Points" that <a href="http://rpgdiehard.blogspot.com/2008/10/benny-economy-in-savage-worlds.html?showComment=1225522320000#c1889478972977477339" rel="nofollow">this commenter</a> suggested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247633/#Comment_247633" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-19T20:58:38+00:00" title="December 19, 2009  8:58PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that it would be pretty fun to put a big plate of delicious frosted cupcakes or a hot, fresh apple pie on the table at the same time the PCs are tempted.<br/><br/>Tell the players that anyone who wants some can, but it means their PCs have also given in (with whatever consequences that entails).

I'd begin it by telling the players that this is fairy food, and yes, your characters are likely going to get screwed if they eat it. Then we'd make various rolls to find out whether they do it anyway, due to how the <i>characters</i> presumably don't know/remember about this fairy food thing, and thus might fall for it, especially if their natural suspicion were being overridden by the supernatural deliciousness of the food.<br/><br/>The reason for doing it this simply is that I find suckering the players with gotchas like this pretty simple-minded, frankly. Classics like fairy food are often cliches in execution if you have to try to pass them over for an audience that is well aware of the rules of this sort of thing; you're only going to make it work in rather contrived conditions. Gastronomic temptation is not going to be a proper challenge for player judgment in a game that doesn't make starvation or enjoyment of food an issue, so this sort of thing is going to seem stilted in D&amp;D, anyway. So overall the most natural way of handling it is to tell the players what's up, and resolve the thing with various ability checks. Just like a succubus or nymph temptation attack, really.<br/><br/>If I wanted to make eating fairy food a genuine conundrum for D&amp;D players, I'd have to institute some rules for eating, something that'd actually make the decision to not eat have an impact. Perhaps having an extended rest required eating heartily to replenish your strength as well. With this house rule it becomes a simple matter of getting the characters to lose their food supply to make eating fairy food a real risk and an interesting choice for the players: a party that has lost its food supplies is down in its strength and comes to a fairy orchard or some such. The players might well <i>suspect</i> that fairy food will screw them over, but they don't <i>know</i>, as the party sage fails his lore check and the GM has never indicated anything either way in this campaign. And if they don't eat, who knows when they're going to get that extended rest they need to replenish their resources. This way the players would actually have something to think about and an interesting choice to make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247672/#Comment_247672" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-20T13:23:46+00:00" title="December 20, 2009  1:23PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>It occurs to me that it would be pretty fun to put a big plate of delicious frosted cupcakes or a hot, fresh apple pie on the table at the same time the PCs are tempted.</blockquote>\nThere's an entire game system (QAGS) based off of tempting players with food, but it's hard to get treats that are actually good enough to be genuinely tempting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247942/#Comment_247942" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T20:24:30+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  8:24PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I decided to keep it very D&amp;D: an attack vs. Will, and if I win, I get to declare something the Bright Beauty compels you to do. If you ignore it, you suffer the Distracted condition (DMG2, p. 13). At the end of each extended rest, you can make a saving roll to see if you shrug it off; or, you can get rid of it by succumbing to the temptation.<br/><br/>I think that strikes a good balance\u2014it doesn't deprive players of their free will, but it still lets them really start to feel the pull of the Feywild. After a few days of missed saving rolls resulting in them granting combat advantage and taking a -2 to all rolls, we should get to see some of the good, crazy, fey stuff.
