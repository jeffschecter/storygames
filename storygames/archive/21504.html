It's been with us since the 70s. What I mean by this is; well, D&amp;D doesn't exactly imply one setting per se, but every setting product I read about has so many things in common.  Dwarves, elves and orcs.  Fighters, mages and usually thieves and clerics.  Society with features that each exist in some not-quite-definable position after the dark ages but before the industrial area.  And of course, a lot of magic.  And the premise is ostensibly about going on quests and adventures, often in dungeons, but not always.<br/><br/>I often wonder how these elements have become so embedded in D&amp;D play (and it frustrates e too how many people consume it so readily).  Yes it's partly because all the products over the years have reinforced it, but why?  To develop a brand?  That's my best guess.  That's how we get things like McDonald's and Budweiser, which are also products that are frustrating to see sit on top of the hill.  And then I think about how the craft beer movement made an impactful dent in the Big Beer Empire, and I'm sure people have made a similar comparison to indie story games and D&amp;D, but what about homebrew D&amp;D settings vs this D&amp;D brand proto-setting?  To be fair, comparing D&amp;D or Wizards to Bud isn't great because we're already talking about a niche product fighting to survive in a world of video games.  But I think the comparison works when comparing the dominance of the D&amp;D proto-setting over other alternatives when playing with those rules.<br/><br/>I wish there were more setting products out there to choose from.  I'm not really interested in the proto-setting anymore; I'm just tired of the same assumptions and givens.  Why doesn't Wizards ever offer something else for a change?  Even McDonalds added McCafe.  I've been inspired for a long while reading Eero's posts about *how* he runs his dungeoncrawl games, but I have yet to find much inspiration regarding what content to use.  And I don't quite have the motivation to put together a full setting (I started on that a couple years ago, but got stuck).  I've been tempted to run some gonzo games just for fun, but have never bitten the bullet out of a desire to play something more coherent and "campaign worthy".<br/><br/>Anyway those are some of my thoughts around this.  I'm curious if others ever think about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470341/#Comment_470341" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-02T22:17:50+00:00" title="March  2, 2018 10:17PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you design enough settings, you see that rules intersect with setting in ways that are painful to change.<br/><br/>The proto-setting you speak of is encoded into the DNA of the character generation rules and the spell rules and the monster rules, for example.<br/><br/>That proto-setting is what you get if you pick up OD&amp;D and start playing without any other setting. <br/><br/>Why do people keep playing it? Well, it's fun. It's also a shared expectation among players. Any time I-as-setting-designer change something from the "default" expectations, I experience friction with players. Getting buy-in for something different than the default is difficult, because players have to retrain themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470342/#Comment_470342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-02T22:58:19+00:00" title="March  2, 2018 10:58PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2018 11:02PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's totally fair to compare D&amp;D to whichever brand of soulless corporatism you prefer, if we're talking in creative terms. Whatever the truth about the home games of the creators - and there's a lot of truth there, from what I understand - the official product line has spent long, long swatches of time under completely soulless corporate governorship. This is plain in the product itself, I feel no need to justify my opinion any further here. If it's also a small and struggling brand in a pool with bigger products, then it's both small and soulless, which I suppose is sort of pitiable - <i>World of Warcraft</i> at least is big, even if equally soulless (I genuinely don't know, I've never looked into it).<br/><br/>The branding of D&amp;D fantasy has been very intentional historically, as far as I understand the process. From relatively early on the corporate owners of D&amp;D recognized that it was in their brand management interest to attempt to distinguish D&amp;D as being set in a particular kind of world, a D&amp;D world. This, as opposed to pushing it as something generic. We can see this in how already in the early '80s the corporation had very clear and prepared opinions in its legal department on what parts of the game, precisely, are distinctively original ideas covered by copyright. We know the list: beholders, mindflayers, dark elves of a particular sort... the same things that WotC left out of the 3rd edition SRD, those are what is supposed to make up the distinct D&amp;D identity, in part because they are the actually unique parts that do not have immediately clear antecedents in the public domain. And of course every D&amp;D product has to support the brand, and prior product: if your D&amp;D setting doesn't have dwarves and elves, what's the customer supposed to do with the rules for dwarves and elves that they brought earlier? Plain sense, that, were it not for wanting to simultaneously be the ultra-generic fantasy adventure vehicle with a zillion different settings.<br/><br/>Fortunately for us, the days of being on the hook for our gaming content is past, and in this glorious world of citizen publishing we don't exactly run short of gameable things to work with; no need for TSR to spoonfeed me a new setting, there's plenty to go around. Anybody feeling dependent on WotC to lead the way today could benefit greatly from developing their toolset further, to take advantage of the cornucopia of possibilities out there.<br/><br/>As an arbitrary example of do-it-yourself D&amp;D hijinks (plus for the sake of bragging), here's something I did a bit of work on just today: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ydl3qxzidykf1b/Darkestin%20tilukset.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Darkest Dungeon</a> as a challenge-oriented wargamey D&amp;D campaign. (In Finnish, but that's how it often is with my gaming notes.) Wasn't difficult, didn't need TSR or WotC to lend a hand, and it's certainly more flavourful than Forgotten Realms [grin]. And we don't even have any plans to play this in the foreseeable future - really, there's more great creative opportunity out there than you can shake a stick at.<br/><br/>More generally, here are a few of what I consider golden rules in campaign development for D&amp;D:<br/><b>*</b> Don't over-design: start with a firm set of general principles, such as a certain topic or theme, and only create what you need to start playing. Build up as you go. That way you don't get overburdened.<br/><b>*</b> Don't design setting: what we roleplayers think of as "setting" is actually merely 'colorful fictional detail'. It's often <i>organized</i> with the conceit of being a fictional world, but that's actually not the primary use or even the most useful format. Rather, think in terms of creative inspirations, consistent styling and core themes.<br/><b>*</b> Put your creative mind to it: whatever you choose as the basic conceit of your campaign (and that doesn't need to come from the setting), it needs to be something that you think is unique, ambitious and important. You need to be better than the hacks at TSR/WotC.<br/><br/>If those seem more like rules for not designing a setting than rules for designing one, then I guess that's because setting isn't that important as a prep matter after all. Rather, I recommend wasting your prep time on procedural questions like whether you're doing a sandbox or string-of-pearls campaign, and practical content matters like which scenarios you're going to run. The setting thing will take care of itself as long as you start with a firm idea, whatever it may be.<br/><br/>I started our very successful (five distinct campaigns, four distinct GMs, several hundred sessions over the last five or six years), very interesting historical fantasy campaign by simply choosing to say that the setting is "basically Netherlands in the Renaissance period" and "the supernatural D&amp;D bullshit is all real, but only in a localized way - there are no mage guilds or weaponized monsters or anything like that outside of what a specific adventure module says - and I don't care why it has not ruined history yet". My choice of "Netherlands" was even arbitrary, it was just something superficially flavourful to help us pick self-consistent names and idle cultural detail ("My character is a protestant!") for the game. Everything else was developed as we went, inspired by the clash between D&amp;D modules and our own desire to draw inspiration from history.<br/><br/>One more observation: check out some less corporate setting products out there, I would be surprised if you didn't discover an inspiring D&amp;D setting in there. For example, I myself am fond of <i>Carcosa</i>, <i>Anomalous Subsurface Environment</i> and <i>Better Than Any Man</i>, just to name a few. Any one of those has more than enough content to kickstart a campaign with, just as long as you find what they offer to be inspiring. And if you don't, there's a huge amount of alternatives out there just waiting to be discovered. Or you can make your own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470345/#Comment_470345" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-03T04:09:21+00:00" title="March  3, 2018  4:09AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2018 4:11AM by Kenny_J.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny for me to hear that people don't have the time or inclination to make up a setting for D&amp;D, because i had the opposite Experience. In high school we had more trouble playing a campaign longer than a few sessions because we wanted to world build some other part of the setting through play. sometimes spending an evening talking about the setting rather than playing at all.<br/><br/>I recognize my experience isn't the norm though. And as Adam said the rules intersect with the proto setting (the core game assumptions) that makes them hard to change. In fact we changed stuff all the time and treated all the printed material as suggestions. When I finally realized we were never really playing D&amp;D at all I started looking for a game system that didn't get in the way of my style of play but rather encouraged it.<br/><br/>But that's just me I love world building, and was lucky enough to have friends that loved it as much as me in my formative years.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470346/#Comment_470346" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-03T05:01:38+00:00" title="March  3, 2018  5:01AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Euro_Tuovinen">@Euro_Tuovinen</a> For the same reason that Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Snow-White will never die.

How unattractive and alien struggling with the "bland D&amp;D proto-setting" sounds to someone used to playing other games, especially games which allow you to build your own setting every time you play. (This is the case for most games I play these days, and have for years.)<br/><br/>2. The period of AD&amp;D history where alternative settings were popular, like Ravenloft, Al-Qadim, and Dark Sun. What happened to all that?<br/><br/>3. <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> 's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21390/adam-drays-city-of-brass-mirrorrim" rel="nofollow">City of Brass</a> setting for D&amp;D.

Very colourful and to the point.)<br/><br/>(Related discussion here, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21387/using-a-detailed-published-setting-how-do-you-make-the-most-of-it/p1" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/21387/using-a-detailed-published-setting-how-do-you-make-the-most-of-it/p1</a>.)<br/><br/>4. My surprise when I recently joined a D&amp;D campaign and the GM explained to me that he was a busy adult now and had no time to "create his own setting", and, therefore, these days he preferred to use a published one. Then he handed me a copy of a WotC 300-page setting reference book and said, "To get ready for the campaign, read through this." <br/><br/>Wow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470380/#Comment_470380" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-04T02:40:51+00:00" title="March  4, 2018  2:40AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another setting that goes against the grain, that Euro knows well, is Glorantha--not hugely popular, despite its cult following.

(By OSR, I here mean the style of play that is reasonably common within OSR, and fairly rare elsewhere in roleplaying - GM as neutral referee during play, resolution by group consensus or realism or GM viking hat which remains fair, sandbox, etc. There are several other interpretations of OSR, which are not so relevant here.)<br/><br/>The modern D&amp;D fantasy setting is a historical accident. The original D&amp;D had a vastly different setting especially if played by the book; see <a href="https://initiativeone.blogspot.dk/2013/05/od-setting-posts-in-pdf.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://initiativeone.blogspot.dk/2013/05/od-setting-posts-in-pdf.html</a> . The dungeons can also be castles of hostile knights, or abandoned spaceships filled with mutants, etc. Then there is also wilderness exploration, which is quite well developed, and other modes of play which are less developed but clearly within scope of the OSR method.<br/><br/>Any particular aspect of any oldish edition of D&amp;D can easily be varied. Equipment lists into scifi stuff? Why not. Change the spell list or remove it entirely and use another magic system? Why not. Etc. Doing several such changes at the same time is more challenging, of course. But removing all magic and being selective about the equipment list would turn it into a historical game of strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>An easy recipe for playing D&amp;D with any setting:<br/><br/>1. Select an interesting setting with inherently dangerous area and potential for violence.<br/>2. Select an OSR game which is close to fitting the setting. <br/>3. Remove unsuitable parts from the game. Add house rules from OSR blogs and games, and custom content if you want to.<br/>4. Play.<br/><br/>Alternatively:<br/><br/>1. Select an interesting adventure, preferably one with a strong vision that you like.<br/>2. Start with some OSR ruleset that you enjoy. Play the adventure.<br/>3. Add a home base or another adventure when it is required. Add one that fits in with the original adventure or that has a strong artistic vision that you enjoy, or even both.<br/>4. Keep playing.

If you play a scenario where the monsters can only be hurt with magic then you'll struggle if you don't have a wizard and/or magic weapons. By the same token, a lot of 'dungeons' were stocked with traps and locks that required a thief, and so on. The assumptions were usually that a party was balanced and had the 'correct' equipment for their level, not that they were a bunch of opportunistic adventurers coming to loot a deserted temple.<br/><br/>The system and the settings were intimately interwoven. I have looked at converting some of the old published scenarios to run for GURPS but decided that it was easier to throw most of the dungeon's inhabitants and features out of the window and restock with my own 'setting-friendly' versions. A magic trap becomes either a cursed item or a fiendish mechanical trap, a gelatinous cube becomes a slow wave of spectral force, and so on. I suppose I could have restated every single monster but life is too short and some of the AD&amp;D monsters were decidedly... silly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470577/#Comment_470577" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-12T19:58:23+00:00" title="March 12, 2018  7:58PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/vgunn" rel="nofollow">vgunn</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For sure, especially at low levels in B/X (D&amp;D).

I don't recall the rules for Basic and Expert well enough to make a specific comment on how they handled things officially (it was a long time ago and I've slept since then). Certainly the games I recall were all about finding monsters, killing them and then taking their stuff. Clever storytelling, negotiation or trickery didn't feature on the players' (or DM) list of options.<br/> <br/>In 1st Edition AD&amp;D, getting XP for tricking or avoiding monsters was stated in the DMG as being very much a subjective decision on the part of the DM, with the default assumption that simply avoiding trouble was worth less XP than fighting.<br/><br/>The way that the XP rules were set out by default meant that you had to fight, and indeed kill, the monsters to get the full award. Treasure <i>could</i> be stolen without a fight, but the XP rewards were reduced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470596/#Comment_470596" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T13:42:09+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  1:42PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not only was there by all accounts great variation in how people actually used these game texts at the table, but it is also a fact that if you look at the texts, the Basic and Advanced varieties of D&amp;D were pretty different in the '80s. Where Basic was generally pretty conservative and harkening back to the early iterations of the game, AD&amp;D from the start envisioned a wider, more varied, more GM-controlled game. The way TSR preferred to see this was that Basic was a "simple" game more suited for children, while AD&amp;D had more of a focus on complex world-building and story, making it more suited to advanced gamers and GMs, literally.<br/><br/>That is to say, I'm not surprised at all if a AD&amp;D crew in the early '80s focused on quest xp awards or "learning by doing" awards (killing monsters, that is), while a Basic group did stark and focused xp for treasure. That behavior would be in line with what the game texts in question actually instruct and recommend.<br/><br/>And, because this is the Internet, let's just explicitly note that the texts having different emphasis does in no way prevent overlap or even outright opposite focus. I certainly know gamers who hold AD&amp;D books as their primary reference and still play pure goal-oriented wargame D&amp;D that could as well be Basic except for the mechanical details.

Groups would use the rules in ways that the designers would have been amazed by. Even we, as spotty teenagers, came up with short-lived campaigns set in weird and wacky worlds where the default rules were twisted and fractured.<br/><br/>The thing to remember was that AD&amp;D was the only kid on the block at that time. The likes of Traveller, Gamma World, Runequest and so on all appeared as time went on, but they were small fry compared to the might of TSR's AD&amp;D. What it meant was, if you wanted to play an RPG you had very little choice of rulesets. No picking a storytelling rules-lite indie game designed to represent rabbits exploring their sexuality or robots struggling against the feeling that they are slaves, you had AD&amp;D rule and had to modify the game to suit your own vision.<br/><br/>Obviously people wrote homebrew games even then (I certainly came up with a few), but the influence of AD&amp;D was usually felt even then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470601/#Comment_470601" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T14:26:49+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  2:26PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From Mentzer Basic D&amp;D:\n<blockquote><br/>When your character started, you had<br/>no Experience Points.

The editions you quote are later incarnations of the old Dungeons and Dragons franchise. When Moldvay revised the Basic set it was already several years since the release of AD&amp;D. One of the changes he introduced (for the better, in my opinion) was that you didn't have to go about slaughtering everything. Mentzer's revision came a few years later, this was the era of James Egbert, Lee and (particularly) Patricia Pulling and D&amp;D being in the spotlight for promoting sex, violence, devil-worship and possibly bad fashion sense. TSR were making a major effort to clean things up.<br/><br/>The relevant passage in the 1st Edition DMG read:\n<blockquote class="Quote">The judgment factor is inescapable with respect to weighting experience<br/>for the points gained from slaying monsters and/or gaining treasure. You<br/>must weigh the level of challenge - be it thinking or fighting - versus<br/>the level of experience of the player character(s) who gained it. With<br/>respect to monsters, each hit die balances 1 experience level, counting<br/>each special ability and each exceptional ability as an additional hit die,<br/>and also counting any hit point plus as an additional hit die. Dividing the<br/>total adjusted hit dice equivalent of the monsters slain by the total of all<br/>levels of experience of all characters who had a part (even if only 1<br/>. missile, blow, spell, etc.) in the slaying yields a fraction which is the<br/>measure of challenge.<br/>[...]<br/>Tricking or outwitting monsters or overcoming tricks and/or traps placed to<br/>guard treasure must be determined subjectively, with level of experience<br/>balanced against the degree of difficulty you assign to the gaining of the<br/>treasure.,</blockquote>\nAs I mentioned, I don't recall the Basic and Expert sets well enough to comment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470605/#Comment_470605" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T14:54:09+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  2:54PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I wasn't trying to say you were wrong!

It might feel generic now, but it wasn't then. It was a conglomeration of the best ideas from SF/Fantasy of the time.<br/><br/>Moreover, if we're going to go back to 70's D&amp;D, I'd argue that there really was no "proto-setting," but there is just Gary's setting and Dave's setting, and how it made it into the rules. <br/><br/>Sure, once people forgot that, but kept enshrining rules decisions without understanding the source, it became a proto-setting. (Do you know why flasks of oil are on the equipment list? No, not to throw AT monsters, but rather to throw on the ground to escape from monsters, according to the OD&amp;D rules.)<br/><br/>Later editions of D&amp;D became a <i>pastiche</i> of OD&amp;D. Listen to D&amp;D 5e design talks with Mike Mearls, and he'll say that he knows that certain rules are broken (e.g., <i>fireball</i> is too powerful for its level) but that he can't change it without pissing off fans). In a vlog panel discussion, he says that for 5e, they had to really look at what the sacrosanct core of D&amp;D is to people and serve that up. <br/><br/>All that said, I think there's plenty of room for creative setting design in D&amp;D. I do it all the time, myself. If I stray too far from the proto-setting, I lose player interest, because they're here to play D&amp;D, with certain expectations of setting. <br/><br/>It's like, you order the same thing from the Chinese delivery place all the time. Why? Because you were in the mood for General Tso's chicken, not because you wanted Chinese per se. When you're in the mood for the General, you call for Chinese delivery. <br/><br/>When you're in the mood for D&amp;D proto-setting, you play D&amp;D.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470615/#Comment_470615" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T16:25:21+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  4:25PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2018 4:27PM by Sadurian.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed. It's also worth remembering that the creation of the Greyhawk setting actually influenced the AD&amp;D rules (and consequently all those that followed). Many of the assumptions within (A)D&amp;D come from that setting.<br/><br/>Tinkering with settings can have unintended consequences. Look at something seemingly innocuous, for example. Let's say the DM decides that his 1st Edition AD&amp;D setting will not have greenskins, no orcs, half-orcs, hobgoblins, or goblins. A reasonable decision to make his own setting different from all the others.<br/><br/>But wait! That takes out the half-orc player race which takes out at least one potential multi-class combination (assassin/cleric). It also means that races speaking greenskin languages lose part of their racial write-up. Hill Dwarfs suddenly lose their +1 bonus against greenskins.<br/><br/>Now obviously all this can be solved with some further tinkering, but it shows that the old (A)D&amp;D settings are quite closely entangled with the rules. They can be separated, but some elements will be harder to change than others. A campaign setting without magic, for example, would require considerable work to remain balanced - magic items and 'a wizard did it' explanation for certain monsters and items would have to be changed, and the natural spell resistance of certain races would suddenly be worthless.<br/><br/>I know it isn't what the OP was looking for, but if I was to create a setting substantially different from one of the canon D&amp;D settings I would look at a more generic ruleset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470618/#Comment_470618" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T16:53:54+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  4:53PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2018 5:03PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed with everyone here who said the setting followed the system.  That said, I think it could be argued that the setting doesn't follow the system <i>enough</i>.  If levelling up is an aspect of these people's lives, their culture ought to reflect that.  Like, "What level are you?" is a conversation that ought to happen.<br/><br/>A friend of mine is working on a setting which actually acknowledges the incentives and metaphysics of the world the D&amp;D mechanics would logically create.  It's still very adventuring-friendly, but it also gets pretty weird.  Ancient Dragons, for instance, love harvesting 11-13th-level adventurers, and also want to make sure no one gets beyond that power level, as they'd then start to pose an actual threat.<br/><br/>It seems to me that, when filling in the blanks left by the system, the D&amp;D proto-setting uses some combination of medieval/renaissance tropes with whatever seems normal to the players.  This makes sense to me for an imaginary place in which we both swing swords (as opposed to shooting guns) and hold conversations.  It's a sensible default, awaiting whatever specific tweak you'd like, such as worlds like Ravenloft, Spelljammer, or Dark Sun.  I imagine that making something like Dark Sun <i>be</i> the default would have made no sense from a marketing perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470619/#Comment_470619" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T17:05:22+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  5:05PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" rel="nofollow">yukamichi</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The repeated wisdom is that, despite the fact these settings were (and still are) apparently very popular, the sourcebooks/boxed sets themselves didn't sell particularly well.

The concept was that a fantasy world had two books - the Player's Handbook and the DMG - dropped into it from on high, and that the residents of that world decided that these were Holy Texts and that they must follow their Sacred Guidelines.<br/><br/>It all went very well, they said, and every adventurer carried around a set of dice, as ordained by the Holy Books, but no one ever figured out <i>what the dice were actually for</i>.<br/> <br/>I ran an adventure like this once, to great success: what would the "D&amp;D setting" be like if there were people who were sufficiently scientifically-minded to figure out that certain activities rewarded people with XP and could be used to gain personal power.<br/><br/>Part of the fun was a sketchy order of wizards traveling around with a questionnaire which included questions like, "What animals, beasts, monsters, or powerful persons have you, personally, slain?" The list included everything from house cats to chickens to dragons and princes.<br/><br/>Very silly, yes, but it was also very fun.<br/><br/>I think that I used the justification that dragons eat rock and ore (and thereby create dungeons, lairs, and caverns), which are melted down in their super-hot innards, and excrete gold, silver, and gems.<br/><br/>Therefore, a dragon sitting on a pile of gold is basically resting on its own dung heap.<br/><br/>Dave, does your friend have anything online/posted or otherwise available?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470641/#Comment_470641" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T21:54:42+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  9:54PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, he's hoarding it all as prep for an eventual 3-year campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/drdrek" title="drdrek"><img alt="drdrek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/drdrek">drdrek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470660/#Comment_470660" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-14T17:00:14+00:00" title="March 14, 2018  5:00PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2018 5:03PM by drdrek.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say it goes beyond even the proto-setting, its player expectation about the style of play.<br/><br/>When I play with friends that have been playing D&amp;D for 15+ years they expect things. A lot of things. Elfs and wizards, yes, but also "Quests", riddles, a lot of "Monsters" to overcome and traps. Oh, traps! I almost never uses those outside of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>When I play with first timers or people that have not drank the geek culture kool-aid over the years they don't expect all of those things. And surprisingly, games ran with the D&amp;D system to these kind of people is very different. More talking, less fighting. They barely care about treasure or abilities. They very much prefer to fight against slavery in the kingdom than disabling doomsday devices under ruins. And they don't even notice if you leave out classic fantasy races or tropes.<br/><br/>So in my opinion its the branding. Its the meta story built around D&amp;D in geek culture. Take any campaign settings you want, run it to non-geek, non-gamer people and they will never enter a dungeon once. Why would they? comments in this thread explain how horrible that sounds. Without the 80's influence to convince them its cool or "the right way", going in to a closed environment with minimal social interactions and maximal murder-death machines sounds tedious and pointless to them. Same goes for classic races or the proto-European medieval thing. If you only offer them the choice between Human, Kenku and Insect people and the classes are only fighter, ranger and paladin they wont even think anything is weird or missing. At least from my experience.<br/><br/>But non-geek, non-gamer people are the polar opposite of the client base of D&amp;D. So they give the people what they want. Call it natural selection or market forces but settings that truly breaks the mold are just not good products to sell to the D&amp;D crowd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Peoples' thoughts concerning the D&amp;D proto-setting? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21504/peoples-thoughts-concerning-the-d-d-proto-setting/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Peoples' thoughts concerning the D&amp;amp;D proto-setting? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21504/peoples-thoughts-concerning-the-d-d-proto-setting/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I think you're right.

Yes, such options are nice but they are not why you go to a burger bar. If you were eating healthily then a different fast-food outlet or even a real caf\xe9 would seem a better option.<br/><br/>D&amp;D carries with it all the additional tradition and expectations that go with the brand. For playing 'D&amp;D' it is the perfect fit. For playing a different genre? Well, there are now other options out there that perhaps model that genre better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470662/#Comment_470662" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-14T19:01:30+00:00" title="March 14, 2018  7:01PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, drdrek.

D&amp;D provides tools for making "try to beat this dungeon" a fun player challenge, and many players are up for that, hobby history or no hobby history.<br/><br/>Agreeing to "play D&amp;D" first, and then getting in character, and <i>then</i> deciding to dungeon-crawl... now <i>that</i> might be pure custom.  And yeah, I can see why a lot of new players would opt otherwise.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Personally, I can go either way (well, depending on the edition), but I want to know the group plan before I begin character creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21504/peoples-thoughts-concerning-the-d-d-proto-setting" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21504/peoples-thoughts-concerning-the-d-d-proto-setting" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21504/peoples-thoughts-concerning-the-d-d-proto-setting/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21504%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21504%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
