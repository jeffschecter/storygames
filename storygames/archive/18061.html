(I suspect one of them may decide to sit it out, but I won't know until everyone gets there.) The aim is to try it out, see how it goes, and, if everyone likes it, keep it going as a regular bi-weekly/maybe monthly thing. I've got my head around the game, I've done a bit of prep (printed all the booklets, written some notes for explaining it to the players, read basically every thread on this forum and the Monsterhearts forum), and I think I'm just about set. The only thing I'm still not quite confident about is, well, the ending.<br/><br/>How do you end a one-shot and make it feel satisfactory as it's own thing, without closing off all the threads in case it ends up being a regular game? I figure this must have happened  before, so I'm looking for advice. I have one ace up my sleeve - one of the players is coming this week and then leaving for Germany for 4 months, so I'm thinking that (with some prior discussion) I could do something major to her character that signifies to the other players that something has changed in the world. But, you know, I'm open to suggestions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407780/#Comment_407780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T05:53:50+00:00" title="March  2, 2013  5:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The standard line that you might have come across on these forums is: Tell your players that "we're going to create a pilot for a new, sexy, teen supernatural tv show for HBO". It gives them an idea of tone and also content. Couching it as a 'pilot' will also get them thinking along the lines of completing something, but also laying down plot threads to follow for future episodes.<br/><br/>What you're really aiming for is a sense of 'initial completion'. The group has taken a step, a significant step, towards their overarching goal; they may rest briefly, but there are more steps to be taken in the future.<br/><br/>What can you do to help this along?<br/><br/>- If the game builds an outside threat emerges then have one of their schemes thwarted at the end of the first session. Perhaps even allow the players to defeat one of the big bad's named goons. Think of the Buffy pilot, where by the end of the pilot she had defeated the Harvest and the Vessel, but the Master was still a major threat.<br/><br/>- If the game builds around a mystery - a murder or a disappearance for example, then be ready to make a grand revelation about the mystery just before the end. If a murder, they learn who the culprit is, but not how to take him down. If a disappearance, then they find the person (either dead or, if alive, then with something clearly 'wrong' about them). You mention that one of your players is leaving, perhaps they can solve one mystery only for that character to then disappear right at the end.<br/><br/>- If the game builds around supernatural politics then be ready to herald a significant change in the political scenery at the end. This can often be the sudden elevation of one of the PCs to a senior political role. "You were just a punk-ass werewolf, but now we've discovered you're the heir and you've got the whole pack looking to you for guidance".<br/><br/>- Another thing you can add to help from the very beginning is scheduling a definite 'event' that will occur before the end of the session - this could be a high school dance, a sports game of some kind, a competition, a fair, or even something supernatural. Telegraphing an event at the start will naturally give the game focus and reasons for otherwise loosely connected characters to interact. So long as you then make sure the event occurs in the last 30-40 mins of the session, the players will get that sense of initial completion.  <br/><br/><br/>Don't sweat too much about laying down threads for the future. The dynamics of the relationships between the PCs should take care of most of that. By the end of the first session someone will have betrayed/crossed/snubbed/sexed/befriended someone they shouldn't have done which is all grist for future sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407789/#Comment_407789" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T10:26:59+00:00" title="March  2, 2013 10:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great advice from EpistolaryRichard! The key, I think, is to show that some kind of transformation has clearly taken place: the situation has changed dramatically from how it began. It doesn't need to have *ended*, just changed significantly. That gives a sense that something important has happened.<br/><br/>Some other tools you might look at:<br/><br/>1. The rate of reincorporation in stories is often a marker of how close we are to the ending. So, as the session nears the end, start consciously reincorporating more material, tying together loose ends, creating revelations which connect bits of the story together. You can do this youself, or do it through provocative questions, too.<br/><br/>So, if at the beginning of the story people were curious about a bloody knife, and now there's a scene with a murderer who must be confronted, when you're getting towards the end of the session, bring those things together. It gives a good coherent logic to what's been happening to find that these two things are related, and naturally telegraphs the sense that the story is "wrapping up".<br/><br/>2. Formalize player and character interests in the story. Have you ever played IaWA? We know a chapter has wrapped up in that game when at least one character's Best Interests have been resolved.<br/><br/>This can work similarly: make sure you talk with everyone about:<br/><br/>* What the players are curious about resolving in the story. ("I really want to find out why she betrayed me!", "Man, we really need to figure out what's in that coffin!")<br/><br/>* What the characters need or want to resolve in their lives. ("She's going down!", "I'll seduce him or kill him... but either way, he'll be mine...")<br/><br/>I'm thinking it may be worthwhile to build in an "intermission", or pause, where you even formalize this process. Take a break, brainstorm a few of these questions together. As the MC, think about how some of the questions might be related. Finally, bring it home.<br/><br/>Of course, let the players know up front that what they're getting is a chapter of a longer story; it won't necessarily have a sense of finality to it. Framing it as a "pilot" of a TV show is a great way to do communicate that!<br/><br/>Finally, thank you for posting about this. I'm running my first Monsterhearts one-shot tonight (using my one-shot playset <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco" rel="nofollow">"It All Ends in Tears"</a>), so this is incredibly timely for me as well!

Intermissions are vital. They'll want them (because it can feel quite taxing playing when you're not used to it) and you'll need them (because 'in play' you're most likely going to be too into the scene to be able to see where the stories going). If you're riffing on the whole 'pilot' theme then call them 'ad breaks' and call for one after particularly dramatic moments so everyone can savour them and have the players talk about what aspects of the story _outside of their own character_ they're finding interesting.<br/><br/>With 5 players, you're going to have your hands full. Some more thoughts:<br/>- it's good to form the story into two plot-lines so you can cut back and forwards between them<br/>- try to avoid having _more_ than 2 storylines otherwise you're going to be overworked (because you'll be doing more in scenes) and the players will get bored (as they'll have longer to wait in between appearances)<br/>- encourage the players to get into pairs or threes as they'll be easier to handle<br/>- encourage strong relationships i.e. characters knowing each other already and having strong (positive or negative) feelings towards each other - it's a bit dull to have all the characters meeting for the first time<br/>- make sure that every player is included in one of the storylines - if it looks like one person is a bit disconnected then drop heavy hints to one of the others that they should take them along as well (e.g. if the Werewolf and the Ghould are on the trail of a monster in the sewers and the Chosen and the Infernal are breaking into the mayor's office and the Hollow is a bit at a loose end then drop the hint to the Chosen that the Hollow happened to intern at the mayor's office last vacation and so would good to recruit to the mission)<br/>- draw the 2 storylines together just before the end<br/><br/>One final idea that my first MC did is at the end, have the players do 'a pitch to the network'. The network suits have just seen the pilot, if they're going to commission the rest of the season then they want to know the highlights of what's coming up. Have the players do little vignettes that show-off a potential future dramatic moment for the character or relationship somewhere down the road.

The characters woke up the morning of th Day That Never Happened -- but remembered exactly what had happened. Good series pilot material.<br/><br/>2. The Event, in this case a big party. Three PCs ate an annoying NPC, a fourth was driven mad by the sight of the Infernal's patron, and the Ghoul happily sated on Chaos calling for her mother to pick her up.<br/><br/>3.

Be considerate of your players' bladders and need for hydration. Give everyone a chance to get up and walk around.<br/><br/>As for ending, I greatly agree with setting expectations up front that this is just a taste, and it's a game intended for ongoing play.  Then follow your Agenda and Principles, and play to find what happens, letting moves snowball. Don't worry about wrapping everything neatly at the end, although that's nice when it happens.  If you leave your players wanting more, that's a fine outcome. I tend to avoid external threats in favor of inter-character conflict, but other GMs have reported good results using them, so either way.<br/><br/>Also, five is an unwieldy number (I find 3 is best, 4 quite good), but if you can get them to clump in groups of 2-3 that may yet turn out well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil" title="m_busuttil"><img alt="m_busuttil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil">m_busuttil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408039/#Comment_408039" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T15:34:10+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  3:34PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">@EpistolaryRichard</a> : that's all great advice, especially the bit about letting everyone be bastards to each other and using that to drive future plots. (It's something that I'm sure is in the book, or at least is implied by the book, but that I'd not thought about too much until you said it.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, Lisa : Yeah, I'd intended to build in a break right after classroom creation, to give myself time to get some thoughts straight and to give the players a brain break after character creation - I think it might be a bit overwhelming for some of them, so I want them to have a chance to read over their Skins and get a handle on some of the rules. Regular breaks thereafter is a good idea, though - I suspect we'd have hit that normally while we were playing, but it's good to know it's coming and plan for it.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">@IceCreamEmperor</a> : montage. Of course. Put on some... I don't know, Muse or something, whatever the kids listen to (Jesus, I'm 21 and I already sound like I'm 70), and get everyone to narrate a scene. I quite like the idea of doing flash-forwards, too, but I suspect both of those might be a bit too solo-narration heavy at the end. We'll see.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Carl">@Carl</a> : yeah, I'm not sure about internal/external threats. My understanding is that certain Skins drive play much more in that direction (the Chosen, to some extent the Infernal and the Fae), so I think we'll see what people choose and work from there.<br/><br/>Thanks for that, everyone; feeling better about running this now. I'll be sure to write it up and let y'all know how it went. If anyone else has any advice, I'd be happy to hear it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
