Son of the comic strip of the Crow, this game was developed over 3 years to allow you to play any revenge story, from the Greek tragedies to the classic Kill Bill, from The Count of Monte Cristo to Old Boy.<br/>\nThe mechanics eliminate the figure of the game master distributing this role to all the role players at the table which, in turn, will have to manage the role of Screenwriter of the Chapter.<br/>\nTaking a cue from the movie Kill Bill, the phase of play is divided into chapters each of which deals with antagonists to exact revenge on.<br/>\nComparisons between the protagonist and his antagonists, PNG or managed by them, will be addressed through a Confrontation Board.<br/>\nSimply rolling the dice and placing them on the table, will help determine who among the players will have a right and duty to narrate the scene of the narrating themes allowing you to add more hands to the development of the story.<br/>\nThe simple explanation of the rules and advice in the manual allows a quick understanding of the mechanics and an easy to learn game mechanism ensuring that the players will be able to self-manage.<br/>\nThe game can be easily completed in 3-4 hours, but finds its expression in taking advantage of a game session for each chapter, that a session of play for each player.<br/>\nThe recommended number of players is 3 to 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere you can find my shop on lulu.

You can read the structure of the Confrontation (that has 5 steps) and the explanation of the first 3 steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanic is suggested me by Psi-run, when in 2008 i had make the playtest (I concerning about roll the dice and after insert it in a board)... I liked it a lot and so I feel the instict to create a similar mechanic for my new game about "the Crow"...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me now it's funny that I published RavenDeath in italian before Psi-run and in english nearly in the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
