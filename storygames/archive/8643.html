You always have five of them, like so:<br/><br/>SMASH THROUGH A PLATE GLASS WINDOW<br/>SAY \u201cNOT ON MY WATCH\u201d<br/>FALL IN LOVE WITH AN ENEMY<br/>RIDE A ROBOT LIKE A COWBOY<br/>PLAY DEAD<br/><br/>Every time you do one of your cool things, you cross it off the list and add a new one at the bottom, so you always have five.  You also get some sort of mojo.  In fact, it is the <i>only </i>possible way to get mojo.  I don\u2019t know what mojo is but it lets you as a player succeed and be awesome.<br/><br/>Now one of the five is always a transformative point for your dude \u2013 in the list above, it\u2019s \u201cFall in love with an enemy\u201d.  This one is worth <i>triple </i>mojo (or whatever) and is authored not by you, but by your friends at the table.<br/><br/>Pacing would be important, I think.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Maybe it'd be wide open - you\u2019re in a fight, and you want to win.  You jump through a plate glass window and grab one mojo and immediately author \u201cMoment of silence as stunned enemies survey my intimidating form\u201d, then inject a little color in the game, cross that one off, grab more mojo, author a new thing, rinse and repeat.  They could come and go that fast, or you could milk them if you preferred.  </span><br/><br/>Or maybe activating statements happens at a more measured pace.  I'm not really sure what's best.  Maybe authoring new ones takes place when they are all used up, so burning through them would be a little more difficult to reconcile, or more dangerous. This seems more fun, to have some elegant governing mechanism that would encourage players to have diverse and interesting statements, covering many situations.<br/><br/>Either way, you might find yourself get put n a bad corner and be forced to fall in love with the enemy at hand somehow, because you had to grab those three mojo to whip him.  I'm not sure <br/><br/>I\u2019m thinking these are like hyper-keys, where the creating of, using of, and buying off of all happen very rapidly.  They are the game\u2019s only source of effectiveness, which drives their use.  You are constantly thinking of interesting, fun things you want to see happen and then actualizing them.  You also have a hilarious record of all the crazy stuff your guy has been up to - "When did I set myself on fire, again?  It's right here between 'Steal a baby' and 'discover a vein of silver'"<br/><br/>Does this sound fun and workable?

Like, if the cowboy game is just starting and I have:<br/><br/>Steal some horses<br/>High noon showdown<br/>Ride off into sunset<br/>Shout Yippee-kai-yay<br/>Throwdown at the hoedown<br/><br/>I really haven't given myself many strong options.<br/><br/>Also, I would suggest playing a bunch of Once Upon a Time, because it has this similar mechanic where describing the things on your cards allow you to play the cards and get closer to winning.  I have had mediocre results with playing OUaT even though I love the idea of it.  There's some "too many cooks" going on as well as some weird pacing stuff that happens.

This s almost makes me want to pick it back up again, but I don't have the time.<br/><br/>Anyway, the "kinda". Here's how it worked. I had a list of things that were ALWAYS awesome, like 'splotions and stunts and people falling to their deaths. And I also had a running list of things people would just write down crazy stuff on, like "Fight i zero-gravity!" and "shrink ray!". Sort of like the stuff you have up there, except you couldn't use your own contributions to the list. Basically, you had this big pool of dice of different pretty shapes and colors, and you could roll as many as you wanted to, and if you won narration, you could cash in a bunch of new dice by incorporating all that awesome stuff into it. It was like a big, crazy, gonzo exercise in creativity, as there were lots more things you had to include in your narration, like weird equipment you built and circumstances depending on the number you rolled and WORDS OF AWESOME and ... Well, luckily the game was usually short. Could have used some moderation, but it was quite workable, and fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, don't know if that was useful, but it might give you some ideas. *Shrug* Also, there were extra bonuses for escalating stuff, so if you blew up something that was larger than anything that had been blown up so far, you got a big die.

And not just thing to happen, thing you want to happen <i>to your character</i>, yeah? And the Czege Principle applies here a bit, I think.  Just like how it's not that fun to create and resolve your own opposition, it's not necessarily fun to create and resolve your own awesome either.  If you wrote these things down somewhere public and other folks could assist you in making them happen, maybe it would work better?  Not sure.<br/><br/>There's also the Mountain Witch Dark Fate trick, right?  Where you give total narrative control to players as long as it has to do with This One Thing.  There might be some mileage there too.  Like, give players authority to drive towards the things they want to have happen, but I'm not sure, off the top of my head, how to make that work in this kind of context.  The OUAT model of stealing narration kinda sucks in this regard.  There would need to be a less jarring way of transferring authority.<br/><br/>Also, if you don't accomplish something, can you cross it off for another reason?  Like, maybe it isn't appropriate anymore.  Now you're getting into IAWA list territory, yeah?  Instead of characters that can potentially re-occur, you're talking about lists of things that may or may not happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191442/#Comment_191442" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T12:49:39+00:00" title="February  6, 2009 12:49PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Possibly more useful comment: I'd say there should be specific moments where you can write down new things on the list, so that you have to save your accomplishments for when you really need new mojo. Here's an idea: You get to write down a bunch of new stuff only when you fulfill a thing that's been written down by the others. So, in your example, you could use up all the regular ones and cross them off, but you won't get new ones until you fall in love with an enemy.

You have to do so many things from the early tiers before you can tag one of your later tiered things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike say there are 3 tiers.  The first two things are in your first tier, the second two in your second tier (including probably the transformative one) and then some climactic type thing in your last tier.  The use and replacement rules are as above with replacing things going into the respective tier.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to do X things from your first tier (like maybe 3) before you can do anything from your last tier.  You have to do 2X things from your second tier (so maybe 6) before you can do the thing in your last tier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted some rules to help keep players from milking things too obviously you could incorporate some ideas from 1001 Nights.  Let some other player create hyper keys for your character in the form of "I wonder if we'll see...".  That way the things you're looking to hit aren't always going to fall into a convenient combo sequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that's the way things get refreshed on the list.  I come up with the first five things I'd like to see my character do.  Then as I use them the other players get to chip in with things they'd like to see my character do.

You have the Key of Cowardice, not the Key of Hiding Under a Table, so the stuff you do to ping your Key can always be new and different.<br/><br/>The thing I see in your list is a lot of pretty specific actions. I write down "Smash Through a Plate Glass Window", and then I have my guy jump through a plate glass window. It feels kind of flat, since there's no phase in between where I have to interpret the Key and creatively apply it. I agree with Jonathan that this is edging into Czege Principle territory.<br/><br/>Graham does something similar in Forbidden Kingdom, with his method for gathering dice. "Take a Wealth die when you show your superior firepower or knowledge." The conditions are still pretty broad, though. "Show your superior firepower" requires creative input from me in the moment in a way that "Hold your pistol to someone's head" doesn't.<br/><br/>So, I think this idea could definitely work, but I'd personally like to see the hyper-keys be a bit more broad and less like a specific stage direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191462/#Comment_191462" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T16:00:05+00:00" title="February  6, 2009  4:00PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like it would be a neat way to rework Console Legends into something that actually... works.

Thanks, guys.<br/><br/>JWalt, I'm not sure how to handle removing items that stop being fun or appropriate.  Maybe you buy them off with mojo, or maybe you just announce that they are no longer fun and scratch them.  Certainly could be an issue, given the specific nature of the statements.  <br/><br/>John, the thing that appeals to me about this idea is the ephemerality and specificity, actually.  I'm the Sheriff, so I should definitely be jumping off a second-floor balcony onto my horse at some point.  It's like a "note to self" about genre tropes, with a little reward attached.  I don't know if it'll work, but that's what I'm after.  <br/><br/>The comments about Czege Principle problems are certainly relevant.  I think in the back of my mind that's why I included the larger, friend-authored one.  That mix could be tinkered with - maybe you author a couple, they author a couple, the GM (if there's a GM) authors one.  I'm reluctant to take it entirely out of the player's hands, because they are still Key-like.  They should point at things you think are fun.  Those authored by others are going to be things that challenge you, likely.  But it could be as simple as an ordered list, stating who authors that statement when it's time to add a new one:<br/><br/>ME<br/>OTHER PLAYERS<br/>GM<br/>OTHER PLAYERS<br/>ME<br/>ME<br/>OTHER PLAYERS<br/>GM<br/>OTHER PLAYERS<br/>ME<br/><br/>Which would be fun, because there'd be some tactical choices about when you pulled the trigger on your transformative big mojo statement that way.  Do you really want your friends to author that?<br/><br/>That said, Simon, I like your idea about pacing.  You've got this transformative thing and you've got a clear motivation for moving toward it, because once you transform, all your cool bits also refresh - it's a new you.  <br/><br/>This is helpful to me and I appreciate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191494/#Comment_191494" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-07T09:03:29+00:00" title="February  7, 2009  9:03AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side Comment:<br/><br/>One of the positives about something like this is that if you're using a heavily genre-related set up, you'll (probably) burn through tropes/cliches pretty quickly- which is good!<br/><br/>First, it lets folks get the stuff they came for out of their system.<br/><br/>Then, it encourages them to come up with variants, and lesser tropes/cliches that haven't been used before by someone else.<br/><br/>By the time players have cycled through a bit, however, they should be pretty well on their way to creating their own unique take on stuff in the game being played by the actual group of people. they'll have moved beyond the mental collection they all came to the game with.<br/><br/>Um, I'm not quite the designer other folks are, so here would be my implementation: Rather than write out stuff and cross it out, just write down the ideas and put them on index cards. You could have them be character specific or not as you see fit. No individual player could have more than five out at once. They can be character specific, or more general. Doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Players have a pool of dice to use for the game. It's a total pool. That's all they'll get during play <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unless they refressh part of it by using the cards</span>.<br/><br/>The card gives both the creating player and the using player the dice from it, but you can't get both ( so if you pick your own, you only get the dice once).<br/><br/>(Here I'm supposing that the players have ranked the cards from 5 down to 1 in value, but adjust as appropriate. Maybe the cards out on the table by a given player have to add up to a certain total instead, like 15 or 20. Whatever; Lots of possible variants there. I'm also supposing that players initial their cards for identification purposes).<br/><br/>So anyway, yeah, that's the core mechanic. Limited total dice pool from the game+ use ideas on cards to gain more dice to use throughout game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191499/#Comment_191499" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-07T11:16:24+00:00" title="February  7, 2009 11:16AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2009 5:42PM by Rustin.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's say, to hit your Hyperkeys, players must achieve them within the scope of a broader conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nA player can't just say, "That's when I smash through the plate glass window" and earn mojo.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the scene must include a plate glass window.

(i.e., Bad guy somehow is positioned behind the plate glass window).<br/>\nThird, the overarching conflict of interest must be resolved, in part, by the character smashing through the window.  The genre trope is not just color, but important to the conflict of interest.
