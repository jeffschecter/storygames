Now I know there are better places for it, but I don't like them. As a result I dont use them. So for the love all that  can be published I hope you great and intellectual people are willing to take a few moments out of your day to help get me in the right direction, even if it is repeating in an angsty voice something i could have found somewhere else because that's why I love this forum. <br/><br/>Request 1 : Is there or has their been a reliable way of crowdsourcing playtesting other than being best bros with andy/jason/kim/alexander/socrates or something else else that is not going to happen for me.  I got a document that im working on , its a game, and im making it for the Random RPG Cover contest, but as I kind of want to actually you know publish something this time as apposed to just puting it on 1km1kt after this is done. Ima gonna need playtesting. Now I don't have a raft of people here to inflict my game upon (at best I may be able to get one group to play the thing, and as far as I can tell the more the better  right) so what's my chances of getting a raft of them? <br/><br/>Request 2 : As I have never actually attempted this publish thing before, does anyone want to mock and or correct what I may correctly or incorrectly believe to to be the appropriate process for this. <br/><br/>Step one : Write Somethign<br/>Step two : Playtest, redesign, and edit<br/>Step three: Layout<br/>Step four: Print<br/>Step five: ???<br/>Step six: Profit (I wish)<br/><br/>So Thanks again folks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205958/#Comment_205958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T07:26:29+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  7:26AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Run the game yourself.

Playtest a bunch with people I know.<br/><br/>2. Playtest my game at local/regional cons like JiffyCon.<br/><br/>3. Post about my game on my blog a lot and maybe some folks pick it up and try it out.<br/><br/>4. Link on <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/geiger/" rel="nofollow">my game's website</a> to any AP post or thread that gets started about my game. Track these through internet tools as well, in case I miss some.<br/><br/>5. Encourage folks to run my games at region meetups, not just big cons.  The Seattle/GPNW crew has been amazingly supportive of my stuff, even though none of it has been formally published yet.<br/><br/>6. Give away free cheap photocopies of my game at GenCon.  Not sure if this resulted in any AP, but maybe.  It made sure people knew my game existed and was being beta tested.<br/><br/>7. Make sure the electronic and print versions of my playtest document A) looked really nice (DO NOT underestimate this, see Lady Blackbird) and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> were easy to use.  Sure, you could save layout until the last step before publishing, but why not do it earlier if it helps your game get more attention / be easier to run.  I did layout for Brennan's playtest draft of <i>How We Came To Live Here</i>.  I'd be glad to do layout for other playtest docs too, as long as they've been playtested locally first.<br/><br/>8. Make sure the people who've been playtesting your game know when a new draft of the rules is out (beta, gamma, final, etc.)<br/><br/>9. Most important of all, BE PATIENT.  <i>Geiger Counter</i> has been in development since... let me check... April 2007.  During that time it's had several early unreleased drafts, two playtest drafts (alpha, beta) with gamma on its way, and 11 independent playtests with the first ones happening in... let me check again... April 2008, a full year after I started working on the game!  That's a whole year of investment before any outside validation from people who aren't people I've played with first-hand.  <br/><br/>10. Also, wading through outside playtesting can be tough, since you weren't there and have to get good at asking questions of playtesters that they can answer easily and give you useful information.  If you just throw a string of questions at them, they may not respond at all or may give you short responses that aren't helpful.  Just because outside playtesting is necessary, that doesn't make it easy or the end of the road as far as making sure your game works.  If other people are playing your game, great.  Does that mean it's ready for print?  Your game is printed whenever you decide, in whatever form its in, so only you can make that choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206582/#Comment_206582" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T14:16:51+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  2:16PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Layout and edit before exposing your document to potential players.</p>\n<p>Nobody's going to try and play a game that's difficult to read or look at.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206743/#Comment_206743" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T13:59:53+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  1:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Layout and <b>edit</b> before exposing your document to potential players.</blockquote> QFT, emphasis added.
