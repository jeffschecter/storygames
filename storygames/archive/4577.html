Per and I have been playing hippie games for a few years now, but Jens was new to the whole deal. He'd not gamed at all in years.<br/><br/>Per had given Dirty Secrets a read-through but not much more. And even missing rules for escalation, getting the dice a little wrong, and me not quite understanding the 'suspicion board' thing, we had a fun couple of hours.<br/><br/>I'm really intrigued that the set-up looks random at first, but actually generates lots of buy-in. For those not familiar, participants take turns to add simple demographic details to three characters - a suspect, a victim and an investigator. While these details could have come from a random generator, choosing the details necessarily means you build up a picture of the <br/>character in your head.<br/><br/>The game felt a bit like a one-directional Polaris. One 'PC' and multiple GMs who support each other. Supporting each other without being able to slip outside and discuss obstacles for the investigator was hard. And I don't know how it'd work in larger groups. But I liked lots of the game and lots of what we created.<br/><br/>In particular, the investigator was flat out fantastic. And almost entirely Jen's work. A Polish immigrant (our game was set in Scotland) who was a little bit Amelie, a little Bridget Jones, hard-nosed and practical. My favorite bit was Jens describing her filling her pockets with apples for an extremely low-key stakeout.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103594/#Comment_103594" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T06:05:40+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  6:05AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked this game - it shows huge potential. I had only read through the rules once, and wasn't really ready to instruct the game in detail, which meant that I made several mistakes, but that's probably what you'd expect. I read though the first half of the book again on the way home on the train.<br/><br/>I didn't explain the conflict sequence accurately enough, for example. I missed that you roll the public violence die, and that the players' violence dice do not count towards the final number of dice. I also missed that you narrate every bid as an escalation (similar to the raise/call in Dogs), and that every conflict potentially ends with violence.<br/><br/>Oh, I also simply forgot that each player has their own dice - Joe and I shared the same dice, but it didn't affect anything as we didn't have a conflict after I lost two dice. Which btw would have been refreshed as every scene without conflict refreshes the Authority player's dice. IF I'd remembered that.<br/><br/>I left rerolls out on purpose, just to get us playing more quickly, though I did mention the option.<br/><br/>This was truly collaboratively created fiction. It was also Jens's first exposure to hippie games, and he handled it magnificently. While having no problem whatsoever coming up with ideas and suggestions, Jens still leans towards describing detail or motivations/thoughts rather than action that might propel the story forward. Thus the story nudged along at a leisurely pace, but it was kind of nice, and the investigator character is truly awesome.<br/><br/>Seth suggests that the player who knows the game plays the Investigator, and perhaps I should have gone with that.<br/><br/>We didn't Appeal very often, which, I guess, is a less good sign? We also lacked meaty conflicts after the first and only conflict, which also wasn't that hefty.<br/><br/>This game can really shine, IMO, when the players are aware of the in and outs of the mechanics and using them to push for conflicts and complications.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103676/#Comment_103676" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T10:04:19+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 10:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay!

Most of my games of <i>Dirty Secrets</i> get pretty introspective at times, both in Reflection sequences and the general direction of the Investigation sequences, which tends to have an overall slower pace to the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>We didn't Appeal very often, which, I guess, is a less good sign?</blockquote>\nTwo thoughts on this.  First, did anyone ever reply to someone else's narration with, "What if it went like <i>this</i> instead?" or something like that?  Or some expression of dissatisfaction with the narration?  That's essentially Appeal, without going to the rules.<br/><br/>Second, a lack of Appeal (explicit or implicit) isn't a bad sign.  It could just mean that your group was already on the same page and didn't have to pause to synchronize your creative vision.  That's great!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>My favorite bit was Jens describing her filling her pockets with apples for an extremely low-key stakeout.</blockquote>\nNice!  That's really cool.  I'm getting a strong picture of the character just from that.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103690/#Comment_103690" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T11:10:35+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 11:10AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite><br/>Sdid anyone ever reply to someone else's narration with, "What if it went like this instead?" or something like that?</blockquote>\nAh! Yes, we did that all the time. Sometimes, moving from a  detailed description to a vague but more open-ended one. A couple of times, changing details of the location or character etc.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to play the game a bit more _formally_, such that one player delivers a line and another very specifically appeals on it.

In other words, what your group did was informal negotiation, with an option for formal Appeal.  That's actually within the intent of the rules.  To put it another way, that's how I usually play.  A formal Appeal is usually only necessary when there's a disagreement between the players and it's time to find out if I stand alone in my opinion or not.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103707/#Comment_103707" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T11:50:42+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 11:50AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We didn't finish the game, but will continue the following Monday, and we are playing the novella grid as recommended for first-timers.<br/><br/>The initial crime was Theft, and there hasn't been any murders discovered yet.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
