Is this becouse the task is too difficult or has no one else thought of it?  Perhaps the market is just too small for adventure writers to bother or the process of writing an iPhone app or web app viewable on an iPhone is too difficult.  What do you think is keeping these two geeky things from converging?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263852/#Comment_263852" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T04:59:46+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  4:59AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's only one possibility! Either<br/>1. Roleplaying geeks don't use apple products.<br/>or<br/>2. Apple users don't play roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Ok, jokes aside, no idea. I tried long and in vain to find a dice roller app for my symbian mobile, too. Apparently nobody bothers yet, the tech is not quite there in terms of being really useful at the gaming table. Also, if you pull out a phone during a session, you're generally frowned upon. I believe we gamers are rather technophobic when it comes to the tabletop (even if we're gadget geeks when away from it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263854/#Comment_263854" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T05:30:50+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  5:30AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clause 3 of the GSL:\n<blockquote>3.\tLicensed Products.

You couldn't do a D&amp;D adventure that had a built-in die roller. All this is 4e only, of course -- 3e is somewhat more forgiving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263877/#Comment_263877" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T08:30:04+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  8:30AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Bryant, that explains alot!  Seems like they were trying to stop anyone making a free version of the DDI.  It kindof makes sense but it is a pain in the ass.  E-books of games should be interactive with hyperlinked texts to the important rule bits.  You could easily do the full text next to the abbreviated text that removes all of the rules into hyperlinks and also have an outline version that allows the GM who knows the adventure well to only bring up those sections that he or she wants.  Fully index the whole thing and store items, spells, monsters, NPCs and even room descriptions as searchable data.  <br/><br/>If someone with access to a back log of 3.x material decided to build an app like that they could expand it so that it is not just an individual adventure app but rather a gateway app where the base app is free and each individual modual costs some ammount of money.  With that kind of library you could make all of the user's advertures searchable together which would mean that each adventure they buy enhances the usefulness of the app.<br/><br/>I don't know maybe I am crazy but it seems like a solid idea to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
