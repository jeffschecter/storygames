So Gygax and Arneson didn\u2019t invent role-playing; it was just one of several concurrent efforts in that direction, represented by multiple publications. Tobias interjects that the current state of games today makes that process much harder, because D&amp;D and its ilk were profoundly broken, and players had to come up with ways of dealing with what was missing. \u201cToday we make games that are really small and tight\u201d and there is thus less need for individuals at the table to fix them. \u201cSo we\u2019re moving away from what Ron is talking about.\u201d Ron agrees in principle, but the larger historical point is that the creative ferment we saw in the late 1970s was silenced (even though it continued albeit voicelessly) by the publishing practices and \u201ccertain ideals\u201d of the hobby, and only the advent of the Internet and the independent publishing movement at the beginning of the 21st century allowed it to be heard once more. He wants to hear Tobias as saying that the resulting dialogue produces more coherent games.<br><br><b>Part 2.</b> Tobias thinks Ron hasn\u2019t exactly captured what he was saying. He is not so much concerned with \u201cthe dialogue\u201d as with the process of creating games. His point is that the games of old wanted to completely model the physical world whereas \u201ctoday we make a game about catching mice and that\u2019s all there is to it, and [thus] there\u2019s no incentive for players to extend the game as much as there was before.\u201d The dissemination  of communication and printing technologies and practices has indeed made it easier for individuals to become creators, Tobias goes on, but \u201cthe culture of patching and extending games is dying.\u201d Ron muses that the change may be a shift from \u201cdesperation to inspiration\u201d on the part of creators. He tells the story of a \u201ccrazy guy\u201d  who in 1999, 2000, was writing little one-page gamelets and posting them on the Internet. He wouldn\u2019t ever create a complete game, this fellow thought, because there was no audience for his work, but posting them on the Internet felt a little better than just squirreling them away in his notebook. \u201cThe name of one of those games,\u201d Ron says, \u201cwas <i>Inspectres</i>.\u201d Ron was inspired by this effort, which gave him a new perspective on the act of designing games: it didn\u2019t have to be about creating the perfect all-encompassing game that could do everything. \u201cWhat I hear you saying is that we are lowering the bar on what is considered a game,\u201d Tobias replies, \u201cand I agree.\u201d A game that\u2019s about everything is about nothing. Ron calls for questions; a woman asks about a game like Solar System, \u201cwhere you have to create specific rules for your own setting\u201d; is this a good thing (because you\u2019re designing rules to suit your setting) or a bad thing (because you\u2019re not designing your own game). Ron ducks the question. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need to classify games as good or bad on this kind of variable,\u201d he says. The real question, he says, is whatever it does, does it do it well? The danger of the question about good or bad is that it may lead to identity politics. \u201cDoes that answer your question?\u201d To a degree, the woman responds, but the question was less about good or bad than about the underlying creative impulse. Tobias interjects a parable. \u201cI live in a solar system, and I make games; this is exactly the situation in the world today.\u201d The premise of the question, he wonders, is that nothing exists in the game from the start; one has to create it for oneself. Correct, yes? Just so; so it is with Tobias himself. The difference is that the solar system that <i>he</i> lives in is a pervasive game, and it inspires him to make certain games, games that are about certain things. The woman\u2019s game may allow her to fill the universe with rules, but those rules aren\u2019t necessarily about anything.<br><br><b>Part 3</b>. Another question, prompted by the discussion of Solar System, seems to be from an audience member who is trying to use it for White Wolf\u2019s Werewolf setting. Ron says that Solar System is unlike previous games that said, \u201cThis is the game, this is all the game you will ever need.\u201d Unlike GURPS or FUDGE, for example, Solar System is <i>not</i> generic, not \u201cneutral\u201d; it has <i>properties</i>: the Key is the heart of the game. Tobias catches on that \u201cSolar System\u201d is the name of a game. He disses White Wolf, and Ron agrees. \u201cBut!\u201d Ron goes on, imagine that there are people who are genuinely inspired by the World of Darkness, and find something powerful or resonant within it, as well as something useful about Solar System\u2019s Key-centered game mechanics. In those circumstances, it is no longer necessary to worry about whether you and your group are \u201cplaying it right\u201d; you can just <i>play</i>. It is no longer a painful, year-by-year, session-by-session process of figuring out how to game should be played. Summing up the discussion thus far, Ron says that \u201cOur first claim . . . is that the current design culture has recovered and celebrates the origins of the role-playing\u201d without requiring the desperate isolation that had hitherto characterized RPG design. Ron says \u201cNow we have the theory.\u201d Not so, Tobias says. He says that RPG designers have no clue about theory. What they have to do in order to make a contribution to game design--and this is different from previous circumstances in that once game designers could make a contribution by making an incremental improvement to an existing, obviously broken design--is create a coherent package of their own essentially from scratch. This is harder.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289066/#Comment_289066" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T22:20:01+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 10:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Bill!<br><br>NOW YOU MUST KEEP GOING                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289068/#Comment_289068" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T22:31:46+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 10:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to pointing to this.<br><br>Bill's comprehensive recap is much (MUCH) more palatable than the jarring microphone war between the interpreter and participants.

Imagine the group that \u201cwe\u2019re identifying with and pitying at the same time\u201d (i.e., <i>Vampire</i> players) and hope that they can enter into an honest intellectual discussion about role-playing online, and reach resolutions that hitherto would only come about through design. \u201cThey would have had to design a game; now they can talk to other people,\u201d Ron says. \u201cWhether this is good or bad I don\u2019t know.\u201d Tobias responds, \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is that we don\u2019t have a huge respect for truth in role-playing rules anymore.\u201d Ron considers this and nods his head. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. Because designers don\u2019t have to be concerned with coming up with an all-encompassing One True rules set, he concludes, \u201cThere\u2019s less psychological therapy in the act of design and more true dialogue.\u201d <br><br>Tobias asks, \u201cIs that because we\u2019re growing old, and we\u2019re growing old enough to say, \u2018Fuck this game; I don\u2019t believe that this is the proper damage for a two-handed sword\u2019\u201d He wonders if the \u201cthe newbies of today\u201d are caught in the same things that he was at their age. Are they part of the conversation, or are they participating in the identity seeking, committing themselves to D&amp;D 3.5 because 4.0 is obviously so terrible. \u201cWell, let\u2019s look at the younger generation,\u201d Ron replies. He has two things to say. First, \u201cThere is a person who wrote a role-playing game predicated on the idea that the two-handed sword damage was all wrong.\u201d That game was called <i>The Riddle of Steel</i>. Second, where [in the old days] did people learn what counted as a good game? \u201cThey learned it in the store.\u201d The retailer was the insider, and they knew everything about role-playing, and they knew how to do it right, and they would inform the 10-year-old game buyer what was what. \u201cI think this was a toxic environment,\u201d Ron says. But there\u2019s been a transformation of stores and more importantly, all of these 15-year-olds are on-line now, and can discount what an uninformed retailer might tell them.<br><br>One thing that\u2019s getting lost, Tobias says, is \u201cHow large a percentage of kids today or people today that are roleplayers are involved in the making and designing games, and how many are actively engaged in this debate and discussion on the Internet. I would expect that it\u2019s a really really small percentage, and [so] we\u2019re looking at this from inside a bubble that we\u2019re a part of.\u201d Ron agrees; the situation is improved, but not a complete transformation of role-playing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael Pfaff</cite>obias said,<em>\u201cToday we make games that are really small and tight\u201d and there is thus less need for individuals at the table to fix them. \u201cSo we\u2019re moving away from what Ron is talking about.\u201d</em><br><br/>I would argue that D&amp;D was always "small and tight" but that people tried using it for more than it was designed for (a game about a party of adventurers going into dungeons and finding loot) and found that unsatisfactory and blamed D&amp;D for not adhering to their goals for roleplaying.

Didn't AD&amp;D have rules for henchmen and hirelings that you'd want when you built your castle in the wilderness once you got to high enough level? Are you saying that those rules were there because people were "using it for more than it was designed for"? Or what? I suspect that "what it was designed for" with respect to D&amp;D is actually a big can of worms.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289218/#Comment_289218" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T12:02:16+00:00" title="August 27, 2010 12:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's also not forget that D&amp;D was designed by many people for many different commercial and artistic reasons over any year you care to mention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289233/#Comment_289233" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T12:59:22+00:00" title="August 27, 2010 12:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I just don't think you'd need to fix much about D&amp;D; (original D&amp;D;) if you were using it for the dungeon crawl experience. *shrug* You only need to "fix" things when you try using it for something else.

I don't think that's controversial, although it's certainly the case that the interpretive eye that you bring to the game text will color your perception of what it's for. If you think that the point of the written rules is to get certain things out of the way so that you can concentrate on the role-playing, then your understanding of how those rules serve you will be different than if you believe that the game text is supposed to give you procedures for everything that's important. In this regard, Jason's point that there were lots of different D&amp;Ds is well-taken: who designed what now? (In this, he's supported by Ron, who says that Gygax and Arneson didn't invent (didn't design!) D&amp;D, at least not in the way that many people assume. You can't just read the box set rulebooks and understand what D&amp;D was to that first generation of players; there was an oral tradition involved, and a lot of "cargo-cult" game design going on as well.)<br/><br/>This gets into the "ought" part: what ought a game do or be? This is the point upon which Ron and Tobias seem to agree: if you believe that your game rules are supposed to let you simulate any in-game eventuality that might occur, then you will search for the One True Rules and since no rules set can possibly be completely faithful to every aspect of reality, RPG discussion turns into identity politics. But if you think your game rules should be focused on doing the particular thing you want this specific game that you're interested in playing right now to do, then RPG discussion can move to a dialogue about how to achieve the play objectives you're interested in achieving. This is the point that Ron is mainly interested in advancing, it seems to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289295/#Comment_289295" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T23:25:46+00:00" title="August 27, 2010 11:25PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>This is really good stuff.

I think it's interesting how the encounter between the two men is less a confrontation than a juxtaposition of two different trajectories through the recent history of role-playing. Ron advances a vision of an increasingly pluralistic role-playing meta-culture in which silenced voices are once more unfettered, lost tribes are brought into the fold, and an on-going conversation permits experimentation and mature judgment. Isn't this ultimately what the Forge is supposed to be all about? Similarly, Tobias talks about a movement toward designs that are compact, narrowly focused, and thematically resonant. If that's not a description of jeepform, I don't know what it is.</blockquote>\nSo what you're saying is, here we have two white guys (i. e. privileged dominant males from western societies), telling us that history so far has naturally and inevitably led us to the pinnacle of gaming evolution, which they represent? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> All we need now is for one of them to say that we now know everything there is to know.<br/><br/>My point may be subtler than that, actually. Of the two, Tobias seems more prone to a Whig reading of the history of gaming (i.e., a narrative of continuous progress), but I think there's actually very little sense of "le etat du jeu, c'est moi," in what they're saying. I mean, sure, up to a point, they seem to be <i>unaware</i> of the extent to which their reading of the history of role-playing is conditioned by their own (different!) experiences, but then Tobias says, "Hey, maybe we're kind of in this bubble."<br/><br/>But what I think is interesting is how the two are trying to negotiate their understanding of role-playing, to reach some kind of mutuality that goes beyond their idiosyncratic experience and parochial perspectives. In that regard, it's especially interesting when they disagree:<br/><br/><b>Part 5.</b> A question about CRPGs: Today 15-year-olds think role-playing is something you do on a computer. This seems like a problem; how do we deal with it?<br/><br/>Tobias responds. He says, \u201cComputer games are hijacking the term \u2018role-playing\u2019\u201d in a somewhat demeaning way, in the sense that the term comes to refer to a relatively shallow or inconsequential activity. Computers have been replacing the GM, which is great in a way, since it frees the GM to do more interesting things than make sure you\u2019ve deducted the right amount of damage from your hit point total. But it\u2019s when we connect as people, face-to-face, that role-playing provides its greatest value, and computers are destroying that by putting people in different rooms or isolating them altogether. <br/><br/>Ron has a different angle. \u201cIf there are people who would be much happier playing <i>World of Warcraft</i> than playing <i>Sorceror</i> . . . then I don\u2019t want them playing <i>Sorceror</i>.\u201d Roleplaying used to be stuffed with people who Ron didn\u2019t enjoy playing with, and who would have been much happier playing wargames. But by 1992, wargaming had pretty much gone by the boards. Then <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> came along, and all of a sudden you had this pretty clever pocket wargame and all of those folks were gone from Ron\u2019s table, and everyone else\u2019s. Oh, the panic! Oh, role-playing is dying! \u201cSave role-playing; shoot a Magic player\u201d was the catchphrase. But that\u2019s nonsense, says Ron. Those people weren\u2019t enjoying the same thing Ron was enjoying, and both he and they are happier now that they\u2019re not playing together. He adds that the term \u201crole-playing\u201d is a legacy term with almost no definition throughout the history of the hobby anyway. If the term gets hijacked for computer games, fine. There\u2019s no particular benefit to the hobby from its use.<br/><br/>Tobias makes a plug for talented young Finnish researcher <a href="denied:\u201chttp://users.tkk.fi/mmontola/index.html\u201d" rel="nofollow">Markus Montola</a>, whose dissertation now in progress includes a section on the history of role-playing that helps clarify some of these issues.<br/><br/>But, someone wants to know, is the \u201cmisconception\u201d of the term preventing a WoW player from \u201cleveling up\u201d to <i>Sorceror</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289684/#Comment_289684" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T20:16:44+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  8:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about other countries, but I've been living in China for most of the past 10 years, and when I say "roleplaying games" here, people immediately think of computer games. When I bring up Dungeons and Dragons and ask if people have heard of it, they say they have, a bit, but look at as if they don't understand why anyone would want to play a computer game without the computer. <br/><br/>If you talk about "roleplaying" in the sense of a sort of improv-acting ability to be used in English class, though, then that's something they're relatively comfortable with. I can easily point to two students and say "okay you're a doctor and you're a patient. Go," or, more interestingly, "you're a girl traveling abroad and your purse was just stolen with your passport and all your money in it; and you're the policeman she's trying to get help from." They react well to the sorts of charged social situations which many indie roleplaying games are trying to foster in their mechanics. <br/><br/>I sometimes feel as though, if I had another word to describe roleplaying games to them, it might work better. I've used "Story games" before, with some success, but they react to it just like any other new word they're unfamiliar with (which may be the best I can expect, I suppose). <br/><br/>The word you use to talk about something really sets the context of a person's expectations about it, and as the meaning of words shifts over time, often times those expectations are incorrect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291040/#Comment_291040" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T06:15:23+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  6:15AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2010 6:15AM by Bill_White.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Part 6.</b> Ron says that the resentment of roleplayers toward computer gaming resembles the resentment of wargamers toward roleplayers in the 1970s and 1980s. \u201cRole-playing has destroyed wargaming!\u201d<br/><br/>A question for the panel: \u201cWhich is more important to you: to create games or to play games.\u201d Tobias replies that he thinks of himself as a pretty good gamewright but a pretty lousy player.

Didn't AD&amp;D have rules for henchmen and hirelings that you'd want when you built your castle in the wilderness once you got to high enough level? Are you saying that those rules were there because people were "using it for more than it was designed for"? Or what? I suspect that "what it was designed for" with respect to D&amp;D is actually a big can of worms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat D&amp;D was designed for was very well illustrated by the blurb on the five boxed sets making up the basic version of the game in the early 1980s:-<br/>\n<br/>\n- the red-boxed basic set for low-level characters exploring dungeons<br/>\n- the blue-boxed expert set for mid-level characters branching out into overland adventures<br/>\n- the turquoise companion set for high-level characters ruling kingdoms [in their spare time*]<br/>\n- the black master set for sillily-high-level characters questing for immortality<br/>\n- the gold immortals set for immortals ruling space and time<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure how many people actually played the immortals game. It was full of abstractions and wierdnesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut basically it seems to me that there were five separate games within the one game:- the dungeon crawl; the overland adventure (basically a dungeon crawl with a bit more freedom of movement); kingdoms and conquests [really as a spare-time activity alongside the other two]; questing for immortality [via a combination of the preceding three]; being an immortal [did anyone actually do this?].<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules worked perfectly well for dungeon crawls and overlands and the rules for kingdoms and conquests had a separate sub-system all of their own which I admired as a child but never actually used in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAD&amp;D blurred the boundaries between the first three sub-games, had very little to do with the fourth and had nothing at all to do with the fifth. 4th edition seems to me to be inevitably stepping back towards something a bit like the old five-phase game set-up because of its more structured nature with heroic tier adventures (now 1st to 10th), then legendary (11th to 20th) then epic (21st plus) IF I recall the proper names for them which I probably don't. And I think it's a good thing - to encourage people to change the sorts of game they're playing with their characters as they get higher level, to try out new and different sorts of game. Although I don't know whether 4th ed does it well or badly as I've never actually played it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the cliche of 2nd and 3rd edition broadening out into generic fantasy roleplaying - I think that D&amp;D always had the potential for use for generic fantasy roleplaying, and was always used for that too. Even basic D&amp;D, with its emphasis on dungeon crawls, that was just a question of emphasis - and maybe a majority tendency, even vast majority, but people were using D&amp;D for more general roleplaying from very early on, I would say from its inception, but I wasn't there at its inception, but I was there pretty early on and even as a child DMing basic D&amp;D at age 7, there was more to it than killing things and taking their stuff, even if not always as much more as I might have liked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291076/#Comment_291076" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T07:26:17+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  7:26AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2010 8:13AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played immortals for a while, it was actually pretty great.

There are uses of the computer in gaming that are more up Tobias\u2019s alley, and they don\u2019t resemble <i>Baldur\u2019s Gate</i>. The advent of small specialized electronic devices for specific games will hopefully be adaptable to the sort of interactive play that roleplaying does well. <br/><br/>Shall we shift to our own work? asks Ron. Or our background and perspectives, at least, Tobias demurs.<br/><br/>\u201cMy background is in Swedish freeform [which can be thought of as ] the missing link between larp and tabletop,\u201d Tobias explains. Roleplayers were a good recruiting group for larping, and so there were a lot of people who were exposed to both. Freeform roleplayers were the ones who refused to swear allegiance to only one, despite pressure to do so from advocates of the One True Way to roleplay on either side. Freeformers adopted movement and acting techniques from larp, without sacrificing the logistical benefits of tabletop. At the same time, there was dissatisfaction with some of the expectations of traditional play, and a desire to get rid of five specific things in order to make play more satisfying.<br/><br/>(1) Rules (rules in trad games are just in the way\u2014they don\u2019t help tell the story. And while the Forge has done some good stuff though in creating rules sets that enable specific kinds of stories to be told, this is not where they were at in Sweden).<br/>(2) Dice (they\u2019re wrong because they\u2019re random; not good for conflict resolution. They lead to GMs cheating in order to make things come out right)<br/>(3) Tables (talking about both: the ones you sit around and the ones you look things up in. They both disrupt one\u2019s ability to engage with the game).<br/><br/>Ron wants to clarify: Tobias is talking about the state of thought that defined \u201cmiddlebrow\u201d (Ron\u2019s term) Swedish freeform movement in the late 90s or so\u2014the starting point of jeep\u2014not current thought, right? No, these assumptions still generally hold true for himself, Tobias says; he's not interested in going back to the past.<br/><br/>Still to come: Why \u201cDragons\u201d and \u201cNew York\u201d make the list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466165/#Comment_466165" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-09T15:41:08+00:00" title="September  9, 2017  3:41PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2017 3:44PM by Bill_White.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\u2019s seven years later, and I am writing a book about the Forge. I\u2019ve rediscovered this old Story-Games thread--I\u2019d forgotten even watching these videos and having this conversation. The links that Moreno Roncucci posted, both on the Forge and in Story-Games, are no longer working, but a little bit of digging brings up the Narrativa channel on YouTube, where the videos still live, and I feel obligated to finish the task of summarizing parts 8 through 13, moved a little bit by duty and a little more by curiosity.<br/><br/>Part 8<br/>Tobias says, \u201cAnd then dragons...why? Why do we need these big villains? We don\u2019t need to fight something large in order for a game to be interesting. Why does there need to be this big boss at the end of the adventure? It\u2019s belittling to us to believe that there has to be such a thing. Saving the world is extremely less interesting than saving the relationship. You can relate to the second, you can\u2019t relate to the first.\u201d<br/><br/>He goes on, \u201cAnd then New York. And of course I don\u2019t mean New York specifically. We had this problem that people...just as they had this feeling that they need to put dragons in the games to make them exciting, they also had to make them take place in space\u201d--a gesture up toward the sky--\u201cand games that were taking place in the real world, they were taking place some place that had been made officially cool by a Hollywood movie. And so again we can\u2019t relate to these places. Why are there so few vampires in Ravenna? There is where it\u2019s at, that\u2019s the place we can relate to, vampires in space less so.\u201d<br/><br/>Ron jokes, \u201cIf we put zombies in, that would fix it.\u201d Tobias picks up on the joke. \u201cWhat Ron is trying to say is that everything can be solved if we add more zombies, and that\u2019s still true, I think.\u201d<br/><br/>But Tobias still has the floor. \u201cSo the Swedish freeform movement in a sense can be described as a reaction to those kinds of things, and adding the larp elements to it. This happened at the conventions, and you can\u2019t ask people to bring a crap-ton of costumes because you don\u2019t know exactly where the game will be taking place. And then we realized that costumes were bad, because they\u2019re in the way. May I break this expensive prop, yes or no? That\u2019s a question I don\u2019t want to ask myself while I\u2019m role-playing. So all this, not having a costume, not having, I mean using my pen as a sword, just makes things easier and facilitates staying in the moment. It\u2019s good for immersion.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI completely agree,\u201d Ron says, \u201cwith the effects you are talking about, which is that if we have these gorgeous costumes and big swords, again, that is focusing on spectacle rather than paying attention to one another.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI mean, the game happens in here anyway,\u201d Tobias goes on, tapping his temple. \u201cIf you put on nice costumes, maybe you\u2019re helping me with zero point five percent, but the other ninety-nine point five percent still happens in here. For example, with a nice costume, you\u2019re still not an elf. I\u2019m the one making you an elf.\u201d<br/><br/>Ron says, \u201cAnd if I\u2019m making you an elf anyway--\u201d and shrugs.<br/><br/>\u201cYes, exactly,\u201d Tobias says. \u201cAdding the costume is the easy bit.\u201d<br/><br/>Now Tobias is ready to \u201claunch into jeep,\u201d as Ron puts it. <br/><br/>\u201cThis was kind of the movement,\u201d Tobias says, \u201cthat started this whole idea of freeform role-playing. Rules-light games: Let\u2019s move around in the room; let\u2019s create stories that are close to us, that we can relate to, that are on the smaller scale rather than on this grander scale. And this was investigated a lot at Swedish conventions. And we had essentially the same movement in Denmark at the same time, even though these two scenes were not talking at all with each other. But what happened in the Swedish scene was essentially that the freeform gamewrights became set in their ways and so all these rules-light games became very similar. For example the game is played as ten scenes following each other, linear time, one player per character, and it\u2019s kind of a crescendo and it ends. I\u2019ve now described quite a few of these games, and that was very frustrating to the people who eventually became the jeepform, that wanted to say, \u2018No, what does freeform mean?\u2019 Freeform does not mean the absence of rules, freeform means the freedom to create a new ruleset for every possible story.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cSystem. Does. Matter,\u201d Ron interjects.  <br/><br/>\u201cI don\u2019t agree, I don\u2019t agree,\u201d Tobias cries. \u201cI don\u2019t agree. This is not system. This is not system. Don\u2019t hijack this now.\u201d A ripple of laughter from the audience. Ron indicates that he\u2019s not trying to derail the discourse, so Tobias drives on.<br/><br/>\u201cWhy are we using that freedom more? You want to start with a question. You know what you\u2019re going to do. You have some premise for a game. You want to say this is a game about what is a relationship, what is infidelity. This is the theme. And then you ask a question: Is this going to be a role-playing game? And the answer might be no. And then you go from there. You have a blank sheet of paper and you are trying to figure out how can we support this theme or this premise as much as possible, how can you facilitate the interaction of these people to make this theme important? And moving into that more serious style of games, as opposed to teddy bears solving crimes--\u201d<br/><br/>The translator, Claudia Cangini, is nonplussed for the first time; \u201cteddy bears\u201d apparently doesn\u2019t translate easily into Italian. \u201cElves solving crime,\u201d Ron says, trying to help. \u201cZombies fighting crime.\u201d Tobias jokes, \u201cNow, zombies fighting crime might actually work,\u201d and everyone laughs.<br/><br/>\u201cWe realized that a really really big part of what a game is, is what\u2019s happening between the players as opposed to what\u2019s happening between the characters, and that\u2019s a great thing to understand because then you start making games that are trying to reach the players through the characters. And maybe the big point of the game is not to pretend to be elves for a couple of hours, but it\u2019s the effect of pretending to be an elf. So maybe the game is about the prejudice or preconceptions we have about elves.

And then we have the inner play, which is what goes on in the character\u2019s mind.\u201d The translator stops to make sure that Tobias does in fact mean \u201ccharacter\u201d and not \u201cplayer,\u201d which he assures her he does. \u201cOur emphasis is that what happens in the metaplay is as important as what happens in the actual play.\u201d<br/><br/>Tobias considers saying more, but decides to stop. It\u2019s now Ron\u2019s turn.<br/><br/>\u201cLet\u2019s begin with exactly where you began,\u201d Ron says, \u201cwhich is the early Nineteen Nineties. In many ways, I\u2019m going to be repeating a bit. Let\u2019s imagine a hobby dialogue or discourse or subculture that has become a parody of itself. It is claimed and widely written and widely taught, that we have at one end what is called in English \u2018roll-playing\u2019 with two ells, to \u2018roll the dice\u2019, and it was associated with dungeons, associated with a certain emotional brutality at the table, associated with characters dying or living, and had accumulated an almost intolerable level of specific imagery, so that unless you were using this specific imagery you weren\u2019t doing it. And the images involved were either dungeons and dragons, or dungeons and dragons in a city called Shadowrun. And that was it, that\u2019s that kind of role-playing. And then people would say, \u2018I don\u2019t do that, I\u2019m a role-player,\u2019 in English spelled ar oh ell ee, and we reject those, we reject all of that. <br/><br/>\u201cBut of course since they were using arguably the same basic systems, they effectively--in the older terms--cheated, and in my opinion most commonly came up with solutions that were themselves not very functional. And although they were supposed to be about stories, were really about posturing and one \u2018storyteller\u2019 telling the story. And of course this also became a weirder situation with the game authors being the storytellers and this person being their mouthpiece, and everybody else being their recipients, and this was good, because you got a story, somehow, such as it was. Then the next development was--and this was complicated--it was also thought and taught that sooner or later you would lose all of those rules, and put costumes on, and move around the room with lots of people, even further cementing the scripted nature of the activity. So the progression as perceived and as taught was thought of as a progression, that once you put away childish things, you would move to the adolescence of real role-playing, and then you\u2019d grow up--you\u2019d grow up and get a clue and become an artist and become a larper. <br/><br/>\u201cThis was the hobby as I encountered it, as I saw it in the early Nineties, exemplified by the entire White Wolf approach in every way. My reaction to much of this was that the entire structure of this narrative was--\u201d he frowns, shakes his head, \u201c--I could not agree with any of this viewpoint.\u201d <br/><br/>From Ron\u2019s perspective, the American indie scene and the Scandinavian one are long-lost cousins. \u201cSo I and others came to certain similar conclusions as the Swedish freeform group, but the techniques that we chose as the medium for rebellion were different. So instead of rejecting the dice, we said, \u2018What can you do with these that is different?\u2019 So in many ways, for the Swedish freeformers and jeep designers, to communicate with what we have been doing, we had to say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re getting up and moving around, you must be those larp assholes.\u2019 And then we had to realize no they are not, they rebelled from that false view, that false progression as well, just taking a different set of the available techniques--\u201d<br/><br/>Ron thinks that Tobias wants to add something here, but \u201cNo no no--,\u201d Tobias wants him to go on.<br/><br/>\u201c--and we rebelled from that same paradigm using a different set of extracted techniques, but the rebellions were very very similar, because--I\u2019m going to quote or paraphrase, I hope, what you are saying accurately, which is that as we are driving primarily from the connections among us as people, those power the fictional consequences in play, with whatever techniques, and that produces thematic content in the fiction, genuine theme, and also producing the genuine theme, not emulating the theme or repeating the theme, that that becomes relevant to us as people. That chain, connections among the people, consequences in the fiction, relevance, that is synonymous. And so I have become far less interested in precisely which techniques were extracted to do this, so I don\u2019t want to identify these views and rebellions and subcultures with any particular set of techniques. I\u2019m interested in whether that progression that I\u2019ve mentioned is preserved and valued.\u201d <br/><br/>Ron is ready to wrap up. \u201cSo as far as I\u2019m concerned, I completely agree about the dragons and New York. These are crutches, they are habits. Should they be utilized, then they may well be utilized in the service of a productive process, but for their own sake, no. For their own sake there is nothing there.\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466168/#Comment_466168" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-09T18:18:52+00:00" title="September  9, 2017  6:18PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2017 9:03PM by Bill_White.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 10<br/><br/>Ron is reaching a conclusion. \u201cSo the tables [i.e., one of the five things that jeepform rejected] are simply part of the techniques that are retained here and rejected there, which to me is very productive, because that gives different takes on the available techniques.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI just need to butt in and comment here,\u201d Tobias says. \u201cOne big thing here, that since we were trying hard to incorporate these larping elements--if you are moving around, if you are using your entire body for playing and creating these interactions, where do you put your character sheet, and where do you go to roll the dice? These are big reasons as well for removing them since they are very hard to do logistically.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNo technique is neutral in its consequences for the rest of the game,\u201d Ron replies, \u201cand that\u2019s great. That means instead of being a slave to a set of techniques that we identify with the activity, we open the door to all kinds of different, much richer versions of the activity.\u201d<br/><br/>Ron is ready to move on. \u201cSo the next issue--and I think this is terminological--concerns \u2018rules\u2019 and \u2018system\u2019. I will try to paraphrase something you said, which is that freeform does not lack rules, it uses rules that help us do what we want.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAnd a fixed set of such rules,\u201d Tobias says.<br/><br/>\u201cI think that is synonymous with my famous claim, that \u2018System does matter,\u2019\u201d Ron says. \u201cNow perhaps the use of the word \u2018system\u2019 has its own legacies in different places that makes it difficult to use. I am not wedded to the term, I only use it in that construction because I am rebelling against the idea that the techniques do not matter because the GM is just going to give you the story anyway. And that was repeated over and over and over again in the States, and in the rules, and in the books I mean, and in the teaching of the hobby, which was never mind the rules, if you have a good gamemaster, the \u2018Good Gamemaster,\u2019 then all you need to do is receive the Good Gamemaster, which to me is an infantilizing situation. It makes infants of everybody else playing. So in saying that system does matter, what I\u2019m really saying is let us seek rules that help us do what we want, irrespective of what rules we thought that we needed. And again a diversity of possibilities and a rather shocking just leaving the idea well I like d20, I like d6--what is this? This is just subcultural identity politics. What am I enjoying now is that we are avoiding a similar identity politics problem with jeep versus tabletop. We don\u2019t need to call one the advanced way and one the retrograde way.\u201d<br/><br/>Tobias says, \u201cAnd we can do that because we know you are intelligent people.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cTo continue,\u201d Ron goes on. \u201cAs long as one is functionally producing the sequence of connections among us, fictional consequences, fictional themes that are relevant to us as people, so that we have begun, we have conducted the activity, and completed the activity, all in the medium of social connection, then the rebellion, the renaissance is a fact. And I am so happy that people have done this, all from these starting points, so that in the tradition of my design and play, we are still sitting at the table and that\u2019s not a crime, but we don\u2019t say we are pure because we still sit at the table. And you don\u2019t have to limit yourself. You can just go out and play. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not really interested in debating, because I see us already agreeing.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we focus on our differences,\u201d Tobias says. \u201cThose differences contain so much information for us to latch onto. The debating or the fighting that we\u2019ve been doing--let\u2019s call them show fights--are great because they force us to evaluate evaluate our approaches. So, why am I in this camp? Why am I into that camp?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCertainly reflection is absolutely crucial,\u201d Ron concedes.<br/><br/>\u201cSo I have just a comment on your \u2018System Does Matter\u2019,\u201d Tobias says. \u201cOur catchphrase that we have that is the most important is our belief that the way you play the story is as important as the story itself.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely synonymous,\u201d Ron says.<br/><br/>\u201cThe way that you make people interact with the story is really the key to the experience of role-playing activity,\u201d Tobias says.<br/><br/>Ron agrees. \u201cThe story matters, the unknown matters at any moment, the--for lack of a better word--the who speaks about what, all of those things matter. We know this experientially.\u201d<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466170/#Comment_466170" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-09T19:44:09+00:00" title="September  9, 2017  7:44PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 11<br/><br/>Ron continues, \u201cSo I also wanted to follow up in characterizing what I have tried to do over the past ten to fifteen years, which is to say, \u2018How does this work? How does this activity work?\u2019 There\u2019s a causal principle, and it struck me that when we sit down to do this thing, there have been extremely different preferences, and I\u2019m not talking about for which kind of dice, or GM or no GM, or fantasy or science fiction, or anything like that. I am talking about why we are there at all. And to take an analogy, if we are talking about all of the different kinds of sports games there are, and there are many, with vastly different techniques but if you have come to play this game across all the sports, there is a basic priority of effort of what you should be paying attention to and seeking to do with your teammates. And if you are doing this and somebody you are playing with--including your opponent, so it doesn\u2019t have to be just your teammates, it could be shared between opponents--if they are not trying to win, this is irritating. So sports have the advantage of all of them sharing this basic priority. It could be--I don\u2019t care what kind of emotion is involved, it could just be this light, cheerful, fun thing or it could be very passionate, full of nationalism or even hatred.\u201d Having laid this background, Ron can allude to GNS.<br/><br/>\u201cSome of you may associate me with controversy on the Internet for one or another supposedly heinous thing I have said or written at one time or another--everyone suddenly put on their neutral faces. Everyone suddenly went, \u2018Oh, no, I would never think that about you, Ron.\u2019 I see you. I don\u2019t care because when I proposed that in role-playing as a hobby we actually see profound differences in priority, astonishingly profound differences in priority that made all the diversity of sports just one thing, and that the presence of these different priorities at the table--or excuse me I should say, the presence of the different priorities among the group--is an extraordinary source of incoherence and dysfunction, the reaction to that I got ten years ago was astonishing. I was the devil. The devil. This was the worst thing anyone in roleplaying had  ever heard. I was divisive. I hated the hobby, obviously. I was breaking up not only groups but my group, this person would say. \u2018You--my group! You are trying to break it up! How can you do this? You\u2019re evil!\u2019 This was terrible.\u201d <br/><br/>Ron identifies jeepform as a narrativist enterprise. \u201cWhat interests me about the jeep movement is that its creative agenda, the creative agenda that feeds into these designs, is precisely the same as one of these that I think we uncovered in the discussion, which is exactly what I described before, which is that we are going to uncover theme at the table and it is going to matter to us.\u201d<br/><br/>But asserting that different creative agenda exist is not a value judgment, Ron implies. \u201cNow there are other priorities possible in role-playing as well. Part of my effort was to discover and celebrate them for their own sake. But to sit down and say anybody and everybody, any game any time, let\u2019s just do it, we all know what good role-playing is, we\u2019re all gamers together so we must want to do it all for the same reasons--it is a legacy of the subculture. It is rooted in geek subculture, that to identify personal differences in why we want to do this, and to group up for a particular game with a particular group of people because we agree on one way to do it, on one particular priority--geek subculture says that is rejecting and bullying other people. Rejecting them, you must hate them, you must not want to play with them. So a great deal of what has happened with Forge discussion, and I suspect has been happening in jeep, is to reject the sense of victimization, the sense of certain social fallacies which characterize geek subculture. And I speak as a member of that subculture. There are many things to love about geek subculture, but we should put aside this belief that unless we pretend we agree about everything all the time, we must be hating each other. And that\u2019s a common reaction. I don\u2019t know if any of you have experienced this.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI completely agree,\u201d Tobias says, \u201cand that\u2019s exactly what I mean when I say this game--\u201d briefly lifting up a thin sheaf of papers on the table in front of him, \u201c--is not a role-playing game.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThat\u2019s actually why I said Spione is not a role-playing game either,\u201d Ron replies. \u201cIn fact I made a little--I scribbled a little thing.\u201d He consults some notes he\u2019s made in front of him. \u201c\u2018We could be talking about designing and playing better role-playing games. We could be talking about breaking that and making a different thing, rather than absolutely defining the distinction between those two ideas.\u2019 I\u2019d rather not do that. I think that there is a productive dynamic between saying I am making a better role-playing game and saying, no, I am making something different. Rather than knowing which one you are doing, perhaps it is better to recognize that there may be a difference between the two but--but it is a dynamic relationship over time with many different games. Someone could have been trying to make a better role-playing game, and what they did opens up the door to something completely different, or someone could have said, \u2018Oh, no, I am completely different, I am not making a role-playing game,\u2019 and what they do inspires someone to make a better role-playing game. We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. Just let that be dynamic. Let that--relax about that.\u201d <br/><br/>He turns reflexive. \u201cI had a marketing and perhaps content based reason for saying that Spione is not a role-playing game; you had the same for jeep. But those are specific to those games. I don\u2019t know whether It Was a Mutual Decision is a role-playing game or not. I was told that Sorcerer is obviously not a role-playing game.\u201d<br/><br/>Tobias interjects, \u201cI was told that if you remove fighting from a role-playing game it\u2019s not role-playing anymore.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cAt that level of definition of the term, we are obviously dealing with a child-like idiot,\u201d Ron comments. \u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI think the most important thing, and I think what Ron is saying, is that you make a stand, and you don\u2019t be ashamed about saying, this is role-playing, this is not role-playing, and trust in other people to be adult enough in their own minds to form their own opinions.\u201d<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466171/#Comment_466171" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-09T20:26:04+00:00" title="September  9, 2017  8:26PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time warp!<br/><br/>But, seriously, thank you for doing this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466182/#Comment_466182" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-10T04:47:17+00:00" title="September 10, 2017  4:47AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, you are incredible.<br/><br/>As for the rest:<br/><br/>It's nice to see my memories of how Story Games used to roll in the 'golden age' aren't entirely false.

If I say, \u2018This isn\u2019t art,\u2019 no one says, \u2018Says you,\u2019 or forces you to fill that in yourself, it\u2019s just implicitly there, and that\u2019s perhaps a maturity we haven\u2019t reached yet, but we should reach that. That\u2019s just a comment.\u201d <br/><br/>He\u2019s ready to make his point. \u201cSo when I say, after I\u2019ve played--getting back to your question--a Forge game of some sort, and I say, \u2018This is fun,\u2019 or \u2018This isn\u2019t role-playing\u2019, of course this is just my reaction, and it shouldn\u2019t be taken more seriously than anything else; it\u2019s more of a story of where I come from than anything else.\u201d<br/><br/>Ron replies, \u201cNow all of that makes perfectly good sense were we sitting around in these very same chairs--if Tobias and I were sitting around in these same chairs with no particular arrangement among the chairs, and we were all talking together, then I don\u2019t think me interjecting, \u2018For you\u2019, would be necessary at all. But the fact remains that you and I--but the fact remains that we are sitting up here at a special table, the camera is trained upon the fronts of our heads and the backs of your heads--the extent to which this is somewhat artificial I think we in the room understand, but it is that particular arrangement and the other--and this backed by economics: I did not pay to come here, you did--these features create imbalances that can affect the perceptions of authoritative talk. So it is my sensitivity to that issue, and it may be an oversensitivity, that leads me to want to focus on that story where I come from aspect of what we\u2019ve said. So this has all been a footnote to the previous discussion.\u201d He looks down at his notes and then over to Tobias and says, \u201cIf it is okay for me to bring up--\u201d Tobias signals that he should proceed. <br/><br/>Ron pauses, thinking, and then begins. \u201cTo what extent is disturbing content a design goal, a feature of play, a productive portion of play? What do we gain from, from either--it could be graphic content, or perhaps visually it is not graphic or disturbing at all but the content of the fiction and the events either is or could be in any way shocking or jarring? In the long-term tradition of the hobby, for a number of reasons, there has been a tendency to want to move that out of the books, and I even suggest to go back to White Wolf, which made a certain point of being \u2018edgy\u2019 or \u2018dangerous\u2019, but only did so in the confines of a particular already established subculture, so in and of itself rebelled against nothing, or was shocking for no one. So my claim is that for the most part, only in the lost origins of role-playing, and only in recent designs, are we seeing an artistic ambition, toward the disturbing, toward the genuinely challenging. What are your experiences with this?\u201d<br/><br/>An audience member responds.<br/><br/>\u201cMy idea is that, yes, when we played Vampire, it looked like we were playing with disturbing themes. Actually, when I tried the Upgrade, it was much more disturbing, because I was myself, and it was much more difficult to see ourselves in a mirror, without being dressed as a vampire.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cMm hm, mm hm,\u201d Ron replies. \u201c\u2018Oh, my costume is so scary and disturbing.\u2019\u201d<br/><br/>Another audience member contributes. \u201cIn my experience, I never managed to play a game really disturbing until I tried jeepform by Andrea Castellani which is called the Truth will make you free, and it actually shocked me. I always wanted to play a disturbing game, but nobody in my group wanted to follow me in this."<br/><br/>\u201cYou were \u2018that guy\u2019,\u201d Ron says.<br/><br/>\u201cYes, I was that guy,\u201d the audience member responds. \u201cAnd just proposing these games got some very negative reactions.\u201d<br/><br/>*****<br/>One more to go, and it's only six minutes long!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466192/#Comment_466192" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-10T20:57:04+00:00" title="September 10, 2017  8:57PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 13--the end of the session<br/><br/>\u201cI think there was a moment--\u201d someone in the audience says, \u201cI think there was a period in the hobby when everyone was trying to insert disturbing themes. The most obvious examples are the third edition with a book about sex, a book about--\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c--the most boring book about sex I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life--\u201d Ron interjects, to laughter.<br/><br/>\u201c--vile darkness, necrophilia, these kinds of elements, apparently extreme, but actually they were put in a context where it was actually fun to insert those. I have no experiences of more recent games but it is actually really hard involving other peoples in these kind of game, in a serious kind of game.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWhat do you mean, other people?\u201d Tobias asks. \u201cOther people from the community, or people that you want to introduce to the community?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNo, even people already playing.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Tobia replies. \u201cAnd so if you go up to someone and say, \u2018Hey, do you want to play a game about necrophiles?\u2019 they will say no--is that...?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIf it is indie, it is amusing, of course--\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cRight, but to really play--\u201d Ron says over to Tobias. <br/><br/>The guy in the audience is still talking. \u201c--but if you try something more profound, it\u2019s \u2018mmm.\u2019\u201d The translator makes a frown. <br/><br/>\u201cMy experience with bringing things that deal with hard stuff,\u201d Tobias says, \u201cin the US for example, has been that people say, like, if we play orcs raping elves, it\u2019s okay--which I think is fucked up, because it\u2019s not whether we are green or have pointed ears, that it\u2019s the matter, it\u2019s the actions, whether it\u2019s rape, or whether it\u2019s war. We are using these things to distance ourselves from our actions, and we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIn this kind of context,\u201d an audience member comments, \u201cnothing can be disturbing, you have distanced yourself.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cMy thinking on this is in deep agreement,\u201d Ron says. \u201cIt has led me to try to design toward less fantastic situations, but on the other hand to consider how fantastic content can bring their themes forward rather than pushing them away. It\u2019s very difficult because the attempts to do that can backfire. You can make your fantasy too much fun. So for example, in my game, It Was a Mutual Decision, which is a game about a romantic break-up, it is also the case that one of the people, possibly both, is a wererat. Otherwise a very naturalistic game, but with this element of a horror movie. My solution was to permit the degree of the possibility of this thing to actually be a feature of play itself, the decisions in play itself actually make that content more or less real. But arguably, I could have simply left it out.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cSo you mean you gave a choice to people how much to distance from theme?\u201d someone from the audience asks.<br/><br/>\u201cI gave them a choice of how much fantastic content they wanted,\u201d Ron clarifies. \u201cOne is to increase the fantastic for purposes of increasing the horror and the pain, to increase it to distance, and then the other two opposites. Yeah, I didn\u2019t know the group could do it, which way would work better--\u201d<br/><br/>At this point, the panel is interrupted because time has run out. The audience gives a little groan of disappointment, Ron says thank you to the audience, and Tobias begins the applause.

I can't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday XD<br/>But some flashes still stick.<br/>Let's see...<br/><br/>I remember everyone being pretty happy <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>It was the second edition of that CON (the only CON of its kind in Italy, at that time, I believe GnoccoCON and the others came in later years?) and the people attending it were still mostly in the "refugee" category ... dissatisfied Traditionalists and Story-curious gamers that finally found a place were they were not "that guy".<br/><br/>I remember Ron being happy for similar reasons... at some point he made a comment about having not often the occasion of talking game design with a broader audience (out of forums, that is) as usually the conversation stopped at the very introduction, trying to explain and get past basic concepts, or the ever misunderstood "Creative Agendas" ... and instead at that convention everyone was more or less up to speed on such basics and the conversations that happened throughout the event were finally about more concrete and interesting stuff. About actual games and design ideas.<br/><br/>More specifically about this talk I remember thinking that Tobias was not getting at all what "System Does Matter" meant. He left me this impression of trying to keep _his thing_ separate from what Ron was describing, and that at some point he just stopped arguing and let the ball keep rolling past this point.<br/>This stuck in my head, as I remember feeling a bit of shock about it ... in my head Jeep games were basically the "System Does Matter" of LARPing ... and instead I saw then how different they were, as in doing what to me seemed obviously the same exact thing (coherent and focused design, with a thing for the emotional stuff) but coming from a different background for different reasons.<br/><br/>Reading this transcript I see now that eventually he got around it with his own "the way you play the story is as important as the story itself\u201d ... but it happened pretty late in the talk, at the end of segment 11 ... so that might explain why the lingering memory was different XD<br/><br/>I remember that the audience was very interested. And participant. For me it felt, at the time, a bit unreal to actually be talking about game design in such an open way. And I felt the same energy around me.<br/>Everyone had an opinion, and we listened to Tobias' and Ron's opinions, and for once the differences were interesting instead of disruptive.<br/>And I liked a lot the convivial mood. The talk happened after a couple of days of playing stuff together, it wasn't something dropped from above by some distant VIPs ... I mean, by the end THEY were asking questions to the audience! It felt more like a chat between two friends that eventually spread to include the other people in the room, than your usual "speech panel".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
