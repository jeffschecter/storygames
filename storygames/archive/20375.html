This is just the moves. It's for a game I'm coming up with, tentatively called Gilded World, which is about pirates, clockworkpunk and derring-do. Cryptonium is the Unobtanium of the setting.<br/><br/>Alchemist<br/>You achieve wondrous feats using Cryptonium. These might be immediate effects, temporary potions or high-tech machines.<br/><br/>Moves<br/>Botanical Mastery<br/>When you forage in the wild for plants roll +Intellect. On a 7-9 choose one from the first list. On a 10+ also choose one from the second list.<br/>Medicine that heals half the Black die on a Mending move<br/>Poison that deals half the White die on an appropriate move<br/>Narcotic<br/>10+:<br/>You get seeds to plant your own<br/>It\u2019s not risky to work with<br/>The plant contains traces of extractable Cryptonium<br/><br/>Extraction<br/>When you spend time carefully working with plants or minerals roll +Intellect. On a 7-9 you get one unit of Cryptonium to use for your moves. On a 10+, choose one from the list below.<br/>The sample will last indefinitely<br/>The sample isn\u2019t glowing vividly<br/>It didn\u2019t take a long time to extract<br/><br/>Distillation<br/>When you spend time to distill Cryptonium into an elixir, roll +Intellect. On a 7-9 choose an alchemical effect that this elixir can effect, plus one item from the list below. On a 10+ choose two.<br/>The elixir will last more than a day<br/>A non-Alchemist is capable of using it<br/>The effect is more dramatic than normal<br/><br/>Evocation<br/>When you destroy a portion of Cryptonium to cause change, choose an alchemic effect and roll +Intellect. On a 7-9 choose two effects below. On a 10+ choose three.<br/>The effect doesn\u2019t have a balancing effect<br/>The effect is subtle enough that nobody knows it was you who caused it<br/>The effect lasts for a whole scene<br/>The effect is permanent (damage can be healed, healed wounds won\u2019t return)<br/>Choose an additional alchemic effect (costs two picks)<br/>Magnify the effect and its balance (double die values, or something else that makes sense, costs two picks, suffer regular balance effect if you also chose to negate the original balance)<br/><br/>Pomp and Ceremony<br/>When you attempt to impress anyone with your knowledge or convince them that you can accomplish wonders, roll +Flair. On a 7-9 choose one from the list below. On 10+ choose 2.<br/>They fear your power<br/>They respect your power<br/>They want to use your power<br/><br/>Alchemic Effects<br/>Alchemy requires the expenditure of Cryptonium. Its effects tend to cause some sort of change. Each effect has a balance. You choose an effect, and the corresponding effect also happens, unless you use a pick from Evocation to cancel the balance.<br/><br/>Alter Appearance<br/>Change your facial appearance and hands to those of someone you\u2019re touching; change their appearance to yours.<br/><br/>Arrest Aging/Speed Aging<br/>You or your touched target stops aging for a month or grow a week younger, up to once per day; the next person you or your touched target sees or touches ages a month immediately (which is almost certainly going to be you if you use this technique on someone else).<br/><br/>Grow Plants/Wither<br/>Cause a plant or seedling to mature and bear fruit; a plant withers. Both plants must be in close proximity. If there are no other plants present, the next plant you touch receives the balance, this stays with you for up to a year.<br/><br/>Heal/Harm<br/>Heal yourself a close target of Black Die damage; cause White Die damage to yourself or someone close by. This can heal an enemy standing next to your target, or hurt an ally next to your healing target.<br/><br/>Repair/Rot<br/>A building, ship or equipment item gets repaired; an item cracks, or another part of a ship or building becomes damaged.<br/><br/>Transmute Metal<br/>A quantity of base metal becomes precious or a quantity of precious metal becomes base. This action requires no balance, but it does require two portions of Cryptonium.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
