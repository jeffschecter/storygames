The game takes place in an Orwellian totalitarian society, and the Great Leader/dictator has recently died.  The meat of the action takes place in a few frenzied hours after the dictator's death, as several others via for power within it.<br/><br/><b>What I want</b> for the game is to have some file footage of the dictator before he died.  Possibly as he died, even.  I'm still unsure on the details of his death, or even if the characters will know any of the specifics of his death.  But I know I want to use <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3139" rel="nofollow">my LCD projector</a> to show the players the dictator giving a speech on something.  And I'd like him to be someone the players don't know in real life, if possible.<br/><br/><b>What I need,</b> then, is someone with a webcam to dress up as a dictator (military uniform or nice business suit) and record a speech in some digital video format.  The speech won't need to be very long: probably only a few minutes or so.  It helps if you have a mustache or fake mustache, because that will likely be an identifier in the LARP for the lookalikes that the dictator had.  I'll discuss with any volunteer what the speech should be about and what I know about the dictator's character (not much is established yet).<br/><br/>I can work with almost any video format: I work in a Media Center for a living, so working with .avi, .wmv, quicktime, etc will be fine.  Likely I'll do some editing of the videos in Final Cut Pro, if just to make it nicely black and white and grainy.<br/><br/><br/><b>Sorry, ladies</b>, but the character is male.  If you really want to volunteer, I could maybe write some other video appropriate female roles. I don't know.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Why you should volunteer to help:</b>  because it's fun.  Because you get to roleplay with people who are separated from you by hundreds of miles and a month of time.  Because you already own a fake mustache.  Because I'm asking nicely.  Because it's like roleplaying, without all that dreadful social interaction.  Because totalitarian dictators are cool to play.  For many of the reasons you'd normally want to roleplay.  Because I'll be extremely grateful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickHollingsworth" title="NickHollingsworth"><img alt="NickHollingsworth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/nKFHDCZ1ID18X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickHollingsworth">NickHollingsworth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80710/#Comment_80710" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T14:56:30+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  2:56PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm late 40s, have evil eyebrows and could arrange to have a mustache.

Everyone liked the dictator's speech and one person said the agricultural report (which was playing on five TVs covering our snacks table) was really cool.  The media breakdon:<br/><br/>I didn't get as much editing done as I would have liked. But I got enough done, so that in the end we had: a speech from Aleksander Dravo playing simultaneously downstairs in the filming studio and upstairs in the living room, the nightly agricultural report playing on a loop on five TVs clustered on the snacks table, an introductory Powerpoint file explaining setting and rules, and pictures of our Glorious Dictator replacing every photograph in my house. <br/><br/>The original plan had called for one more TV showing Dravo's speech, but Dan's laptop couldn't handle Quicktime well enough, and an interrogation mini-game based on Powerpoint and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_task" rel="nofollow">classical psychological experiments</a>. This latter failed when our backup PC would boot into Windows, so we created some interrogation rules on the fly, which worked just fine.<br/><br/>The speeches running on loops made the dictator seem really pervasive, even though he wasn't present at all.  It worked great.  I'm still working on getting the video up on Youtube.
