There was a huge, beautiful fold-out one they did for the Michaelite choirbook, but I can't seem to find a picture of it on the internet.  Here's a sample from the corebook.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/himmel.jpg"/><br/><br/>Basically I want a dungeon map drawn vertically.  So the character slowly descend down from the top of the palace towards the front gate, with each room containing a puzzle that must be overcome.  The puzzles are not drawn on the map, because they are freely invented by the players, but the various rooms and chambers could suggest different kinds of puzzles based on how they are illustrated.  For example, one room might not show any way of getting to the room below (no ladder or stairs) or a passageway might be blocked by a collapsed roof or something.  But not every room would have to be depicted in that way.  Some would just be palace chambers of some kind, with no clear puzzle.  Studying maps of castles or palaces might be required in order to come up with enough ideas for the number of "rooms" in this sideways dungeon.  I'm thinking 100 might be a good number.<br/><br/>Anyone know of an artist or artist who does work like this?  I admit to not knowing the D&amp;D dungeon map illustrators very well,but surely there are some who specialize in this kind of thing.  I guess I should also try to figure out who did those maps for <i>Engel</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113310/#Comment_113310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T09:55:29+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  9:55AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37996594214@N01/sets/72157601899446999/" rel="nofollow">Tony Dowler</a> does interesting and lovely maps of all sorts.
