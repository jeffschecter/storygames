For those of you who felt you played in a Sim focused manner I'm curious as to what role the Issues played in your game since that's pretty much "Fill In The Blank Premise" for Nar play.<br/><br/>And yeah, Agon is pretty balls to the wall competitive.  It's basically a team sport (group vs. GM) where you're ALSO competing for MVP within that team.<br/><br/>As for me the great Sim hits of the indie-world are:<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century: Central reward mechanic, playing to character type leads character to danger who, also playing to type allows him to get out of danger.<br/><br/>The Committee For The Exploration of Mysteries: Characters move from one unit of colorful unit of danger to another colorful unit of danger where failure only leads even more colorful units of danger.  No GM.  Interesting timer mechanic.  I actually prefer it to SotC.<br/><br/>Full Light, Full Steam: Similar reward mechanic to Spirit of the Century coupled with an overt recognition and reinforcement of those character type elements in the Scrip system.  Basically, you get XP for acknowledging when in the developing situation it's time for a character to "do their thing."<br/><br/>I hear Dead of Night is a great Sim game but haven't played it or read it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185480/#Comment_185480" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T10:43:41+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 10:43AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've observed many PTA player come up with Issues based on what issues they think a TV show of the sort (and on the network) that we've selected would have, gleefully uncaring about what they were or how they were addressed, including intentionally addressingly them ham-handedly in a few cases, for massive lulz - suggest airing your program as a Lifetime Mini-series sometime and see what happens to your Issues, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185483/#Comment_185483" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T11:03:32+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 11:03AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be because I didn't get much sleep last night, but I read your Traditional list about 6 times now, and I honestly can't determine what you're getting at. <br/><br/>But just looking over that list, and my narrow understanding of what Sim is (I looked over the Sim essay, which I read once like 6 or so years ago, but these days it's all filed under "tl;dr"), I'd say maybe:<br/><br/>The Whispering Vault<br/>Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium<br/>I'd say Castle Falkenstein, too: But it looks pretty, and has quite a bit of background/setting data, so it fits into your traditional exclusion list.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185484/#Comment_185484" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T11:05:13+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 11:05AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2008 11:06AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I think there's a playtest copy available of Sign in Stranger online so you can check it out and see if meets your criteria.

Also, what features of those systems actually contribute to that effect?</blockquote>\nI think these questions could more easily be answered if you first described, in positive terms, what you hope to get out of "a Sim game." The negative description technique seems to be tripping people up and preventing engagement.<br><br>In any case, I think Mike Holmes (though I honestly wouldn't know where to look for the threads right now) has made a pretty strong pitch for Heroquest being very Sim-facilitating. Not only does it provide an immensely rich and layered world with magic, cultural depth, and complex mythology, but your character sheet is basically one huge list of every relevant aspect of a chraracter: skills, cultural knowledge, magic, personality traits, relationships, and so on. All abilities are more or less equally usable in the resolution mechanic, which, Mike points out, has the beautiful result from a Sim standpoint of allowing you to <i>feed all relevant inputs into the system</i> and have it spit out a result, the narration of which is colored by all the inputs. So besting Gorm One-Eye in the Imperial Slaughter-pits is different if you used Brave, Swordfighting, Dueling Tactics, Hates Gorm One-Eye, and the Ancestral Blade Brainbiter, than if you used Cunning, Rock-throwing, Gutter-tactics, and Prey on Misfortune.

I agree that playing PTA sim-wise seems quite near impossible without taking some serious freedoms with the Issue as described in the game text. Of course, the same could be said of how I hardly seem to manage to get Nar out of Universalis.<br/><br/>Anyway, to answer Filip's question, I might explain <i>Dead of Night</i> in length, but I'm going to do something simpler. This is how <i>Primitive</i> facilitates a certain sort of Sim:<br/><br/>When you first start playing <i>Primitive</i>, you have to make a choice: are you going to take the setting of primitive cave men seriously, or are you going to put in those dinosaurs, vikings, lizard men and other stuff? Should you go for the former, which is what the Finnish groups seem to always do, certain specific forces start to push for Sim mighty hard. Specifically:<ul><li>Nobody at the table knows too much about prehistory, but presumably somebody knows enough for you to want to go for a "historical treatment" instead of the nazi dinosaur option. In fact, the setting is so sparse that the game immediately asks you to answer some immense questions about it: how do these cave men live? What are their daily routines like? Do they love, go to war, pray? Do they have marriage customs? How long do they live? Are they happy in general, or wretched? These questions are of such import that you cannot really play the game without answering them at least implicitly. A committed group of players is thus, by necessity, going to focus on the minor details of the setting right from the start simply to get everything straight and explore enough to make some room for <i>something to happen</i>. This process lays the perfect ground-work for sim, should the group be so inclined.</li><li>The communication system works its magic in this process as well, as it further limits the play experience and sets barriers for efficient and purposeful action. Should the players draw pictures like the rules recommend, they will find that the pictorial supports a simulationist interest in the setting as well - the process of play itself pretty much creates a living album of places, people and items that clutter the cave man lands. This whole process has a strong doll house feel to it, and that's pretty much the way to appreciate it, I've found - you're just going to get bored silly if you're not interested in creating this slowly expanding world. This is world-creation sim, pure and simple. Every time I've played the group has spent most of its time tinkering with the fictional details of simple construction and hardcrafts as they've strained their brain to figure out how a cave man would build a functional raft or some such.</li></ul>Of course, Primitive is an immensely incoherent little jewel, the game practically begs for a hard-ass gamist treatment with its communal resource pool - and certainly there's Nar possibilities all over the place as well. But Sim is something I've found unproblematic and natural with the couple of groups I've played the game with. I've yet to play a longer term game, so I have no idea what'd happen after the players got over the constant need to expand the setting and determine routines, but I suspect that the momentum of exploration would carry for quite a while.<br/><br/>I agree, though, that it'd be easier to recommend specific Sim games to Filip if we had some hint of what he might find interesting. I personally suspect that he might enjoy <i>Dead of Night</i> - if for no other reason, then because it's a very clever design. I have many of the same reservations Filip listed when it comes to actually playing even well-designed sim games, so one of the reasons for why I like DoN is that it sidesteps all of that and just provides me with compact B-movie horror in one-session packages with hardly any effort. Like having your own movie factory in the backyard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185533/#Comment_185533" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T18:11:58+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  6:11PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about you sell me on yet another godforsaken 'Sell me on X' thread, where you basically sit there making vague gestures and passive-aggressively indicating that everybody's responses just aren't quite what you were looking for? And then everyone else starts up a conversation that is basically independant of anything you said because they actually want to discuss something interesting instead of just throw random game titles at your straw man target?<br/><br/>I like Conquer the Horizon for sim, myself. Pure exploration, literally, reinforced by some simple competitive mechanics.<br/><br/>JD's comment on PTA is also solid -- I think people pay as much attention to 'is this Issue appropriate to the series we have devised' as they do to 'is this Issue one I am interested in addressing in play.' Though either way, how they choose the Issue is less important than how they eventually play to it, when it comes up in-game. Are they addressing the theme or celebrating the themes of the genre?

He's not nearly the most annoying guy to stalk these hallowed halls.<br/><br/>As for sim vs. nar in PTA and its ilk, I can only say that the difference is glaringly obvious in play, when you know your own reactions and can communicate with the other players to find out their thoughts. In a sim game I basically know what's going to happen. In a nar game I often don't have a clue. And when I'm trying to play nar but the game goes sim I get really, really bored and even feel constrained by the tightening bonds of clich\xe9 that I'm forced to produce to keep within the genre expectations. In a sim game I celebrate this fulfillment of structure, as I'm the craftsman trying to bring it about in the first place. It's difficult to dress in words, but the difference is huge. In fact, it's so difficult to dress in words that I invite anybody to try - I'd love to have some facile simile to throw around about this.<br/><br/>Also, <i>Spirit of the Century</i>. I know that I mentioned it already, but it might be a game Filip already knows, and it's certainly a popular game. That's one rather obviously simulationistic game with few of the problems in the original list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/herrmess" title="herrmess"><img alt="herrmess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/herrmess">herrmess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185564/#Comment_185564" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T05:04:03+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  5:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Riddle of Steel sans SAs.

You might have to fudge a lot, though, to get "Story Now" rather than "story eventually".<br/><br/>If you just want the Right to Dream "exploring alien environments", though, the rules facilitate that extremely well.  (Unless you're trying to immerse, and watching your fellow players invent the world on the spot would ruin that for you.  It didn't for me...)<br/><br/>Forgive the long-form GNS terms, I just think they apply better to my points this way.  Calling Sign in Stranger a "simulation" of world-exploration would be much less accurate.<br/><br/>My personal favorite version of "Sim done right" is the game I'm designing, Delve, which avoids all of your no-nos except "procedurally incomplete", which I'm working on.  What's "right" about it to me: situation is emergent from player choices, not scripted by GM metaplot; yet, at the same time, the fiction is opaque and it's quite easy to convince yourself that the setting is real without ever being reminded otherwise during play.  Within that, you get to do a lot of learning, induction, and deduction, as you discover secrets and figure out how they work... which is close to Gamist, except that you don't have to show any strategic competence to keep the secrets coming.  Color is hugely important: there's a dial for the players to communicate desired levels of detail to the GM; player rewards for contributing color; and character sheets that track color-inspiring stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, this is in many ways opposite to Sign in Stranger.  I just happen to like 'em both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185648/#Comment_185648" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T20:57:24+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  8:57PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnypundit</cite><br/>What exactly makes<em>Primitive</em>'s actual play not go the Sim route if the group puts in those dinos and stuff?<br/></blockquote>\nWell, this is just conjencture, as I haven't played this way, but every time I've played the game I've personally felt very strongly against the dinosaurs, and the people I've played with have felt the same. Essentially, the pulpiness seems to undermine the process of setting exploration I describe above. If you're going to make the setting blatantly fantastic, it's even odds that you're also going to get humoristic, and at that point there's no group pressure at all to not make your character Grug-the-man-with-the-large-club and go do something with the actual high-order mechanics of the game. This is not conducive of wondering about the issues that are in the core of the setting exploration - I'm not going to speculate about the sexual mores or dress code of the cavemen if we're actively trying to pulp up the setting - this shows very clearly in the <i>Record of Threats</i>, which is sort of a gamist prism for the original game: if the GM frames the situation of play with something like "your tribe has been driven out of their home and now you're on the coast, wondering how to get to the lush island just across the straits", it's pretty clear that the game will not be about group-wide setting exploration of the sort I described.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185673/#Comment_185673" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T03:43:05+00:00" title="January  2, 2009  3:43AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to stick my nose into this thread just long enough to link to Ron's APs <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21954.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27029.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

My first inclination, however, would be to go for either narrativism concentrating on "what is humanity" and other such questions, or gamism working around some simple hunt-the-dinosaur stuff.

Of course my experiences are colored by myself being part of the groups that have played, but I've also discussed the issue with the people I've played Primitive with, and it seems that we share quite a passion for taking the cave man genre seriously, as weird as that might sound. One guy is even planning a Solar System supplement about cave men. No idea why we like the genre, but ever since I played Primitive I realized that I want an even more comprehensive game that takes a more coherent stand at exploring the primitive man. I got Og basically because I wanted to see another cave man game, but it was a sort of a disappointment for being another ultra-light treatment. Interesting how you can get hooked by a genre like that.<br/><br/>So take the same game and give it to a group that is intensely interested in chaotic pulp fiction and who appreciate genre-mashups and just trying to figure out how cave men and nazis go together, and you're going to see a different sort of game. Perhaps it'll be sim - as I said at the beginning, Primitive is really, really incoherent, it's basically only going to cohere if the group happens to have a strong shared vision of what a cave men game should be "about". For us that shared vision has, perhaps due to my own personal influence, been all about serious armchair anthropology (not science, you understand; more like science fiction); for some other group it'll be dinosaurs. I can't explain how the game supports sim without a strong setting focus the way I can explain the setting-focused play we've experienced, but that's not to say that it's not possible with the right group doing the right things. And of course, if you're interested in the <i>setting</i> of that dinosaurlavamenlizardfolk game, then I'd imagine that the same or similar mechanical forces would drive the game as have been working when we've played. I can't offhand understand myself why anybody would play setting-focused sim in such a frivolous setting, but people have widely differing tastes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185853/#Comment_185853" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T21:16:29+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  9:16PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem I see with much of this discussion is that people are simultaneously trying to define "Sim" and recommend a "good sim" game, which is pretty hard when "sim" is being defined as a whole bunch of stuff you hate.<br/><br/>Apologies in advance to the exceptional posts, if I am out of bounds on that comment, then you can just disregard it.<br/><br/>I do have something directly helpful to suggest, though. If you accept that the examples of "Sim" games in Ron Edwards's "Right to Dream" essay are canonically correct, then you should avoid the area tagged "High Concept" and look instead to games that are under "Purist for System". The one that stands out is classic Traveller as it provides a lot of systemic support for setting and scenario generation in the core rules, without the need for a detailed pre-packaged setting. At least, this is true for the original boxed set; I don't know about the Mongoose reprint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185865/#Comment_185865" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T02:35:29+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  2:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>people are simultaneously trying to define "Sim" and recommend a "good sim" game, which is pretty hard when "sim" is being defined as a whole bunch of stuff you hate.</blockquote>\nI wholeheartedly agree.

Do I read you right?<br/><br/>You already have a short list of good candidates to go try out: Dread, Dead of Night, Sign in Stranger, Primitive. Primitive has the GM-fiat thing going for it, so you won't like it. I have not played the other three. <br/><br/>You ruled out SotC, but you might look at FATE, which is very lightweight. FATE (and SotC) has a bit of that going on, but not a lot, and it has things like aspects and compels that put a lot of narrative authority in player hands. FATE also requires a little group-customization to get rocking, but I feel that's Sim-facilitating.<br/><br/>I think someone suggested Universalis. I haven't played it myself, but I can probably talk intelligently about it: No GM. It's basically a giant SIS-management machine. If the group are on the same page regarding doing "Sim stuff," it should do Sim very well. It probably reasonably lets players drift a bit towards Narr without the game exploding, too.<br/><br/>My SF/cpunk game, Verge, has some very strong Sim-facilitating mechanics, like shared world creation (it has NO default setting). It also gives the GM very limited currency with which to fuck players, and very explicit rules for difficulty rolls and other things you don't like GMs fucking about with. Mostly, Verge's GM is there to play the NPCs that the players invent, play pacing games with the story the players are creating, and provide additional adversity when the PCs aren't at each other's <br/>throats. Verge should be available for playtest within a month (gasp).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186074/#Comment_186074" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T14:07:02+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  2:07PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>This might be the point at which everyone ought to say "fuck this 'Sim' bullshit" and instead focus the conversation on finding <i>an actual game you think would be fun</i>.</blockquote>\nHe speaks wisdom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186105/#Comment_186105" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T15:38:16+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  3:38PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How 'bout Lacuna?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I find that the idea of "trad" is often bound up strongly in a post-80's metaplot/GM-storytelling context associated with second edition D&amp;D and Vampire. If you're rejecting everything prior on that basis, then you're lumping in a lot of stuff that might surprise you.

It's like some people have a great need to participate in the discussion despite not having any useful knowledge or experiences about the actual topic. I've been biting my tongue a bit to not say this, but frankly, I'm not seeing the value in telling a guy who wants to learn more about modern simulationism that the whole concept is wrong-headed and he should be focusing on his own fun, anyway. I know that when I'm researching new vistas of design, I vastly prefer that people engage my question instead of trying to convince me that I'm a bad man for daring to explore the concept in the first place. In other words: if you don't yourself even believe in the existence of a simulationist creative agenda, perhaps you're not the right person to instruct Filip in how modern games go about fulfilling that very purpose. If being vaguely defined (if that should be what Sim is) made discussion of a concept into a grave sin, perhaps we shouldn't discuss this vaguely defined thing called roleplaying at all. And finally, if having different ideas about the concept appear in the thread is proof that the discussion itself is wrongheaded, then that's one mighty facile way of shutting down any and all dialogue.<br/><br/>To get back to the original question, which I happen to be able to answer by the virtue of having actually played a number of simulationistic games instead of just criticizing the concept in the Internet, one interesting type of simulationist attention that some games make a good effort at is character-centric concept sim. I'm thinking of games like <i>octaNe</i>, <i>Full Light, Full Speed</i>, <i>Houses of the Blooded</i> and <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, for example. What is common to these games is that the basic onus they put upon the individual player is essentially that you have to <i>fall in love with your character</i> during the character generation process or early play to enjoy the game. These games also have a systematic method for enabling the player in this process: each game, while differing widely in the scope and mechanization of their resolution mechanics, involves a very heavy-duty character generation system that essentially allows for lots of player creativity and requires the player to visualize a full literary character concept akin to how comics-writers work for the character generation process to go anywhere. The actual play of a game that centers on the character concept in this way can often vary widely simply because the goal itself is very flexible: it doesn't matter to us what the game's practice actually is as long as it allows the player to experience and express his powerful character vision in the playground the GM sets up. Perhaps looking at some of these games might be useful for Filip? Of course it's notable that this sort of sim is also front and center in many traditional designs, so these particular games might not teach anything particular in this regard, except perhaps how one can cut most of the unnecessary setting and mechanics and still leave intact a quite valid platform for character expression.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186243/#Comment_186243" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T10:03:34+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 10:03AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

The last such GM playground I enjoyed was set up such that all the PCs had very different takes on certain factions and forces that were running around.  We got to 1) have fun in-character ideological discussions, 2) make decisions about "what to do next" based on these, 3) go experience something in the world that would make us rethink our positions, 4) repeat.

Not a pretty sight when their character concepts get brutally dismantled.<br/><br/>That being said, the way something like octaNe works is that it encourages character interaction as a venue for character expression. Think of your stock fantasy game, in other words - the players of the dwarf and elf might get hot for mutual dialogue simply because doing it allows both to showcase the peculiarities of their characters. In the little play of octaNe I've done there's definitely also been a facet of mutual appreciation to this as well - players seem to be very likely to respond to each other's character concepts with overt suggestions for things to add to the other character's mythos. From the outside it looks like you're failing as a player if nobody is laughing at your boring character, but the game is certainly somewhat vulnerable to immersionist infection - if a given player is happy just living in his head and not expressing his amazing character to the others as well, the game will fall flat.<br/><br/>Hmm... might be my volatile history with immersionism of the hardest brands you're likely to find on this earth, but I can't off-hand name any coherent modern sim designs that really support immersion without drawing deep from the techniques Filip lists in his first post. Seems that the only way to make the game even happen with all the players lost in their own headspaces is to have a strong GM who pushes the game along. There are some modern Finnish games that are basically like this.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say that appreciating your own character vs. appreciating those of others is a relatively flexible thing in this sort of game. Loving your own character is pretty non-negotiable simply because you're basically going to get bored fiddling with that character if you don't find constant fascination with writing his backstory, drawing him or whatever it is that you do to worship the character. I'm also sure that many games work better if the player has an appreciative audience for his character, but immersionist games seem to work differently - or perhaps they just don't express their interest in ways I'd notice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186423/#Comment_186423" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T18:43:38+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:43PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip: <br/>I totally do not have a game I can't point at for you, but I can tell you about a little orphan mechanic/artifact thing I've been noodling around with, and maybe you can work it into another game somehow.<br/><br/>Background:Where I'm coming from on Sim:<br/><i>To me</i>, Sim has to do with staying true to the settting, situation elements, and style of some source material.<br/>(Weirdly "staying true to..." can also mean parodying the source material really well).<br/><br/>I'd note that the source material in question can be something created by the players, or the GM. It need not pre-exist from someone else's art/writing/comic/film/whatever ( although I'd expect it to in some for reference other work).<br/><br/>So, the artifact/mechanic: Idea Collages/sheets<br/><br/>These sheets are simply like the sort of things you see young people, especially teen girls, make. A largish sheet of paper covered with snippets of cut-out writing and probably some images.<br/><br/>Except, instead of pics and phrases from Teen Beat or Cosmo or something, you're using stuff related to the game you want to play.<br/><br/>If you're the GM or game initiator or whatever, you'll probably want to make these up, at least one per player, maybe more.<br/><br/>You may choose to use something like index cards instead, then stick them to a bigger board.<br/><br/>Make it messy. Cover all of the stuff <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> think is important for the right feel. It could be combat results, or scenes, or locations, or ways people act. Whatever, let your brain go.<br/><br/>Make sure each sheet has a variety of types of stuff ( or not; a heavily focused sheet could be interesting, too, although I only just considered that possibility now).<br/><br/>Leave room around the cards or snippets of images, so people can make notes and scrawl on the thing.<br/><br/>Place the stuff chaotically around the sheet. Turn stuff at weird angles or upside down and side-ways.<br/><br/>Hand this stuff out before the game kicks off. Let the participants have time to digest all the things you've picked out to put on the collages.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, the idea sheets have no <i>direct </i>impact on play. Instead, they're meant as a springboard for ideas central to the type of game being played.<br/><br/>I suppose you could experiment with having particpants create their own collages, or bringing elements for collages, and making them there at the table or before the first official game session.<br/><br/>Players can trade them around, too, swapping if they wish. I could see "scenario specific" collages as well, or collage elements  tacked onto pre-existing collages for the same setting/on-going game.<br/><br/>Hack up the collages and used them to make new collages after a story arc if you wish to better reflect the evolving understanding of the setting/situation/style/character development.<br/><br/>One key thing is that they are messy! They don't completely, individually tell everything about the setting, etc. The goal is to create a soup of ideas, and then let group pattern recognition emerge.<br/><br/>Is that non-trad enough? ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186592/#Comment_186592" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:56:15+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:56AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't have to "make Sim", it just aids it.<br/><br/>I mean, music, cuties, and booze don't "make a good party", but they sure do aid it coming into being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8392/x" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8392/x" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8392/x/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8392%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8392%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
