I think that many have arisen naturally in the games that I ran, but not as a result of intentional effort.<br/><br/>My group is transitioning from a weekly to a bi-weekly game.  My tendency as a GM is to sustain lots of story and character threads simultaneously, evolving naturally from the consequences of the players choice and the NPC agendas.  Some of these get resolved and some fall by the wayside during play.  But this tends to lack structure or unified tone, and I believe it often feels to the players like progress is difficult because few things are ever resolved permanently.<br/><br/>I'd like to increase the ability of individual sessions to stand alone as units of play (to give a feeling of completeness and satisfaction to the players), but still sustain interest in the campaign as a whole.  I'm looking for suggestions on how to learn from the model The Wire, and other narratives, offer and implement them from the GM side.<br/><br/>So:<br/>What are your suggestions for creating campaign, story, and/or character arcs?<br/>How much do you try to emulate 3 / 5 acts structure or the rising action, climax, falling action of traditional narratives?<br/>What specific suggestions do you have for keeping things tight - i.e. starting an arc and delivering a satisfying conclusion in 1 - 3 sessions?<br/>How to work with players to create character arcs that aren't artificial feeling?<br/><br/>Your suggestions and experience greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_174938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174938/#Comment_174938" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T12:47:41+00:00" title="October 14, 2008 12:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd describe the traditional narrative in roleplaying games as <b>hook - conflict - climax</b>. Before these I have preparations, and after them I have epilogue and experience. I try to get a climax of sorts every time, a scene that triggers some feeling of completeness, but I don't succeed each time.<br/><br/>By focusing on a possible conflict, though, and planning a bit, I usually do succeed. I don't do anything else than look into what elements the players would like to play around with, and give them some hook pertaining to it, and then drive the consequences (and possible motivations in NPCs) towards whatever climax there is to be had.<br/><br/>Sounds like you got most of it in your fingertips already. Only need to organize yourself a bit, and perhaps ask yourself if the game you play by is good enough. My advice: go for a game with simple conflict-resolution, and build it out with sophisticated method (leadership, group dynamics, storytelling, etc.).<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174939/#Comment_174939" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T12:47:48+00:00" title="October 14, 2008 12:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think for creating a campeign, the most import thing to pay attention to is the colour and tone of the damn thing. Nothing says a bunch of seperate but choronological adventure's like the eqyptian quest, the horror quest, the greek quest, the russian quest, etc. I think this is also part of the reason why some campeign settings are popular (strong colour or strong tone characterizes alot of cs). This communicates to your players what is expected and provides a continuity to the story threads that you already seem to have a handle on.<br/><br/>Second the thing for continuing a campeign is contrary to alot of indie game advice, is to have an end state. Go in with an expectation of how the game session/arc/campeign is going to end. Don't get married to it but you know take it out for coffee, give it a try. Its great to say that 'we'll know the end when we get there' that is the asumption of ' don't plan the ending out' from games like dogs in the vineyard and others, but honestly I think most of those games do end up having a ENDMAKER to tell the players its over, using this advice in a more traditional system or style leads to what your complaining about, a lot of unended or unending story threads that don't have a satisfactory conclusion. While its not fun to be driven to a specific railroady end, its also not fun to wonder about doing nothing, not sure how this ties into the story, and never being given signs that This is the wrong way, etc.<br/><br/>I strive for the 2 part play, rising action and climax. Its great to read resolutions or see them on stage but in the game I'm not so sure. I've occassionally done a return to the town where you defeated the archbishop of hate kinda thing, but my players never digged it, they found it boring. YMMV but I would recommend scrapping the third act. <br/><br/>Make sure you players are on board, somewhere somehow there is a fancy name for this, but quite frankly if your players aren't working with you, you will get nothing done. If everyone is on the same page, I could shit on a page and hand it off, and something okay will come out the other end of play. Your group is the key to your success not some whimsically rules of good story from the internet. <br/><br/>that would be my advice, hope it is helpful                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174973/#Comment_174973" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T15:08:57+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  3:08PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key to all arcs is endings, and planning for an ending <i>must happen</i> if you're going to have a good one.

One of the things you may notice is that every character and location of interest for the first two thirds of a season are introduced in the first episode.  Only a handful of new faces and places are introduced in the course of that first two thirds, and if you go back and review the course of a season, you will find that those additions are introduced far earlier than you remember them being introduced.  Random example from <em>Babylon 5</em>: how early is Zahadum, site of the final battle at the end of the entire show, introduced?  That would be episode <em>four</em>.<br/><br/>Additionally, long-running shows also tend to run on a relatively small cast \u2014 a handful of primary protagonists (AKA the PCs), but also a handful of supporting characters and a handful of recurring 'villains' \u2014 there are the odd one-off characters that only appear in one episode, but the bulk of the adversity and foiling you see on these shows are done by characters that stick around and keep coming back.  In fact, you see the biggest fan uproar or loss of interest when new characters are injected into a long-running series (Lochley in B5, Ezri Dax on DS9, Riley on Buffy, the Ori on Stargate: SG1, and so on).  The world of the series, the setting, is emblemized by the regular cast.  Changing the cast is changing the show.  And that can be done well (Ezri), or poorly (Lochley), and will be the source of never-ending debate, as well.<br/><br/>To my eye, the lesson to take away from these examples is to develop a relatively small stable of characters and locations \u2014 somewhere around ten to fifteen \u2014 and then whenever you need a character or a location, look to what you've already got before you go and create something new.  A lot (A LOT) of campaigns suffer from the "new chapter, new place" problem where the GM thinks that constantly giving his players a stream of new stuff will keep them interested.  This is exactly backwards for most audiences \u2014 what people want is continuity, to get to know characters and places, build up history and associations, and inhabit that world in their imaginations.  (This problem is also exacerbated by gaming assumptions often leaving antagonists dead at the end of an episode, but that's a whole different topic.)<br/><br/>So how to make campaigns tight?  Don't loosen them up with too much stuff to keep track of.  Keep things tight by making sure all your parts and pieces are few in number and have many interrelationships.  A new character or location custom-made for a conflict is almost always less interesting than an old character or location dragging its baggage back into the spotlight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174981/#Comment_174981" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T16:19:37+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  4:19PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I struggle with this GMing my regular, traditional game (<i>In Nomine</i>, if you know it - terribly broken system, but lovely setting and concept). Mostly it's because I do try very hard not to force particular outcomes or even particular story threads on he players, but have to compromise between that and plot threads that meander going nowhere interesting, or between players who have nothing to do and then just have their characters bimble endlessly until I have some plot show up.<br/><br/>I think the key to the compromise is to aggressively introduce hooks, but try and leave their resolution open-ended - but making the hooks <i>interesting to the character, unstable and critical in terms of situation, and having lasting, meaningful consequences</i>. In short, Bangs.

I do a lot of that because of Bangs being exhausting, but often find that my players are slow to take initiative on things that aren't actually about to explode in their faces. So I scatter those hooks, and then when I get tired of waiting for someone to bite on one, I either throw in a new, jagged hook made of nitroglycerine, or I attach a small nuclear device to one of the existing hooks.<br/><br/>The "lasting, meaningful consequences" bit is the part I struggle most with, especially in this In Nomine game where (for setting and mechanical reasons) it's bloody hard to actually kill anyone for good. I need other types of concrete ending which aren't just the deaths (or at least, serious discomfiture) of the antagonists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174988/#Comment_174988" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T17:25:18+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  5:25PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/yudhishthirasdice/125" rel="nofollow">a bit about this</a> on my blog. <br/><br/>And while I don't specifically talk about character arcs, if you look at the structure you'll see smaller arcs building into larger ones as a cornerstone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175008/#Comment_175008" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T21:19:37+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  9:19PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running 3-session campaigns for a long time now (which evolved out of my desire to both keep things relatively short and reach a satisfying conclusion). Generally, when we create PCs we give them a purpose as a group which it is assumed they will try to fulfill. Sort of building an end in at the beginning. I ran two sci-fi campaigns recently where each had an assumed ending. In one case, the ending was pretty wide open - we knew it would end but not exactly how, and the answer to this question developed itself both in-game and out, through play and discussions with the players. In the second game I had an ending in mind but the campaign itself was mission-based, which meant the PCs had a built-in goal to focus on.<br/><br/>So the focus of the campaign helped decide the characters which helped decide the goal, if you see what I mean. Once I have that, I can pace and present things to achieve that goal.<br/><br/>Having the players on board with this is obviously good. I often find players quite willing to help drive things to resolution quickly if they know it's just three "acts".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
