The last five events were just Chris and myself, though we did manage to get one of the store's managers to join us in a quick game of rebooted Ghostbusters.<br/><br/>We did go through the effort of putting up bright and colorful signs, including e-mails, website, and QR code that they could scan for more info. That didn't net us anything.<br/><br/>Our current thinking is either business cards or flyers.<br/>As for myself, I'm thinking the business cards would kind of just get lost or ignored. Instead, I'm thinking letter-sheet flyers.<br/><br/>Now, here's where the game design help comes in.<br/>In my mind's eye, these flyers will end up being folded into 4.25x5.5" postcard-sized pieces. The front side would have all of the contact information, what we do, what we play, etc. etc. etc.<br/>On the inside, however, I'm thinking of printing 1-page minigames.<br/>So, the question is, what kind of games do you think might be interesting for people new to indie games? What genres or styles of play do you think lend themselves well to not only a compact rule system, but also as a launching-off point for new players?<br/><br/>Right now, I have three...nay, four concepts that I'm working on, and would like to have a few more (that way, when/if people grab the flyers, they get a surprise of "hey, this one isn't the same as the one my friend grabbed!"):<br/><br/>-Basic dungeon delving: using standard playing cards as oracles for events, and character abilities defined by die vales a la Dungeon Squad or Cortex.<br/>-Adventurer Bragging: using a similar concept to the delving, but instead the cards represent the players telling about their past exploits, and trying to gain control of the story through whatever deceit, misinformation, or fast-talking they can muster.<br/>-Master Thief: players are master thieves, a la Lupin the 3rd, or Catwoman, with three scores: Guts, Wits, and Luck, and two skills that represent broad training. The GM sets up their heists with a hand of 10 cards, and can earn more as the thieves run out of luck. (actually a variation of a game from an old Japanese RPG collection from 1998)<br/>-...and something hacking Ghost/Echo. Since it's really easy to get those rules onto a single sheet of paper, though it may have a bit of a learning curve.<br/><br/>So, if anyone has any ideas for genres, concepts, or styles of play that would work, I'd love to hear them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355735/#Comment_355735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T11:03:18+00:00" title="January 24, 2012 11:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2012 11:04AM by James_Mullen.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Cthulhu Dark</b> is a marvellous place to start looking for inspirations for mini-game design: Graham has done a wonderful job of condensing the Cthulhu experience into a minimal set of rules. The trick seems to be tapping into a vast pool of extelligence and the shared experiences of the players, thus freeing up room that would otherwise be spent on explaining settings, tones, themes, etc. Thus <b>Cthulhu Dark</b> explains almost nothing about it's setting, assuming that 'everyone knows' how Cthulhu adventures work.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoincedentally, my current project is very similar to your idea: I'm producing a series of fliers each of which is a character for an action/espionage game. There are 8 fliers in total, but you can play the game with as little as 3 of them, the only requirementr is that each player has a different flier.

I may have to borrow that as an option.<br><br>And yeah, I have been thinking about the Cthulhu Dark rules. I'm just wondering how easily indie-newbies would grok the rules. For most of us on StoryGames, it clicks after a few readings and we're ready to go. But I wonder how that'd translate to someone who has only played D&amp;D 4E, Magic: The Gathering, or GURPS.<br/><br/>...maybe if I optimize the flyer a bit, I could fit the rules of how to play on the one side, and leave a quarter-panel on the "Who we are" side for an individual character.<br/>Hmmm....things for me to ponder and tinker with...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355740/#Comment_355740" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T11:27:38+00:00" title="January 24, 2012 11:27AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it be possible to incorporate the "Who We Are" stuff into the game in some way? Say by planting clues or relevant facts in it, or just using it a source for addtional content for the game, e.g. when you need the name of an NPC, take a name from the "Who We Are" page... something like that anyway. This might work well if the game is linked to the club, at least in a fictitous sense, e.g. have the PC be investigators trying to infiltrate a secret organisation which uses your club as an innoccuous cover... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and feel free to grab any ideas off the website: some of the micro-game stuff might be what you're looking for, or at least point you towards an idea.
