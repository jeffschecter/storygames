It went too well. The gamemaster just didn't know how to top our first session (which involved an improvised play, something he had hoped to have us do as a finale), and ended prematurely as a result.<br/><br/>This sort of game works best with the type of players who normally have to be reined in during play. The performance gives them the opportunity to go wild with ideas and do crazy things. When the show ends, you've got the behind-the-scenes drama to explore with lots of recurring NPCs that are often missing from stories involving travel. Personality quirks are pretty important, too, so make sure that whatever game you chose to play, quirks are a part of it.<br/><br/>I've seen the OWoD book, Midnight Circus, and found it pretty uninspiring and bland. It struck me as just a bunch of things that might be in a circus without the cultural subtexts that really give them teeth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191541/#Comment_191541" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T08:53:05+00:00" title="February  8, 2009  8:53AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Watch Carnivale if you haven't already.<br/><br/>There are several other traveling circus movies that might give you ideas:<br/><br/>Circus of Fear, with Christopher Lee<br/>Berserk! with Joan Crawford<br/>Freaks, with real-life circus freaks!<br/><br/>Now I'm getting excited about doing this myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191545/#Comment_191545" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T09:55:23+00:00" title="February  8, 2009  9:55AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my friends did this with second edition D&amp;D and says it was really fun.

It is hilarious fun, especially due to the fact that circus-acts may be very, very weird in a magical world.<br/><br/>The game leans heavily on a routine performed by the players/characters each gamesession:<br/><br/><i>1 - Traveling to the town/city<br/>2 - Eat, relax, get sleeping quarters (or sleep in wagon)<br/>3 - Find a place for the performance<br/>4 - Build wagon into scene, make the performance known<br/>5 - Buy supplies, repairs, socialize with locals<br/>6 - Performance:<br/>6A -  Leading the show (shifts between characters)<br/>6B - Starts with group-act (all characters in one act, to present themselves)<br/>6C - Solo acts, with money-gathering<br/>6D - Ending the show (without waking the envious rage of drunken farm-hands)<br/>7 - Pack the wagon and get out of there!</i><br/><br/>The routine stays the same until the GM introduce elements to vary it. By making the players responsible for the routine, the GM is free to focus his creative energy on varying plot-elements. It makes for an easily maintained campaign mode that supports the GM in his work, and makes the players more "in charge". They set the pace of the game-session, and the GM may lean back. His most important task is to play the NPCs and to introduce his pre-planned plot-element(s) at the right time.<br/><br/>By combining this with a political system based on professional political circus' (various circus-troupes compete for political power in "The Peoples Republic of Grand-Babel"), the game is permitted to evolve from "innocent" comedy to intriguing political satire.<br/><br/>I've played this a lot, and have had great fun with it. The crazy solo acts and the routine is key to making <i>Fabula Circus</i> such an interesting campaign to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191639/#Comment_191639" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T08:17:47+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  8:17AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Deadlands came out, I really wanted to play it and a buddy of him, Jim, brought out the idea that he had used, that the players are part of a traveling show.  I loved the idea and we all made our characters based on that.<br/><br/>The problem was, after a while, new players to the game made characters who were more cold-eyed killers rather than performers.  We shouldn't have let that happen but it did and the game kind of crept away from the premise of a traveling show and into the idea of a bunch of traveling bad-asses.<br/><br/>If I could have gone back, I would have added structure to it, allowing me to futz with and break the structure as we went.  There'd be a part of the adventure where we went into town to advertise for the show and pick up provisions and then the show and then some good ole monster-whuppin' adventuring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191648/#Comment_191648" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T09:35:37+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  9:35AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Haha, when I first read this I thought<br/><br/>Why Would Anyone Want a Adventuring Party Based on Family Circus</blockquote>\nIda Know                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191685/#Comment_191685" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T11:51:52+00:00" title="February  9, 2009 11:51AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe no one has mentioned it yet.<br/>If you want to do the side-show/circus freaks angle, read the book Geek Love by Katherine Dunn.
