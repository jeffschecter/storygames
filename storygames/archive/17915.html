This isn't directly story-games related, but I still hope to tap into your collective knowledge.<br/><br/>A friend and I are currently writing a medium-sized LARP (~25 players), with the premise of LARP-within-a-LARP: during the great plague in Milan (1630), the Duke is holding a special sort of masquerade that he calls "Living Drama", essentially, a pseudo-historical version of a LARP, with rigid rules based on Greek drama. The Living Drama is written and orchestrated by young John Milton, who uses it as a draft for Paradise Lost.<br/><br/>When writing the characters for the 1st-layer game (conniving noblemen). I don't have any trouble with coming up with motivation to enter the game, but I want to make sure they have different motivations for staying in the game and playing it earnestly. So, what I'm looking for is different motivations for roleplayers. So far, I have come up with these ones:<br/>1. To prove some theological or philosophical point (that is, to pursue an in-game goal of some sort)<br/>2. To use the character in order to speak to people with whom you are not supposed to speak outside the game (such as Protestants)<br/>3. To be, if only for a moment, something greater and more powerful than your ordinary self.<br/>4. Pure escapism (there is, after all, a terrible plague raging outside the Duke's palace)<br/>5. To watch over another person, and make sure they do not get carried away by the game.<br/><br/>I would greatly appreciate it if you could come up with more of these. If you could also match these motivations with second-layer characters (characters from the book of Genesis, angels, devils, personifications of emotions, virtues, vices and natural forces), that would be even better.<br/><br/>---<br/>Additionally, in order to add some flavor to the game, and to make sure people don't confuse first-layer terminology with second-layer terminology, I could use your help in coming up with some Old-timey Italian or Latin expressions for PC, NPC, GM, in-play and off-play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405326/#Comment_405326" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-03T03:23:21+00:00" title="February  3, 2013  3:23AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2013 3:25AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some literal Latin suggestions:<br/><br/>Player character = Persona Corporis<br/>Non-player character = Persona Fabulae<br/>Game Master = Magister Fabulae<br/>In-play = Intrafabulae<br/>Off-play = Extrafabulae<br/>"Living Drama" = Drama Vivum<br/><br/>I repeat the term "fabula", 'story', for consistency in a world where "roleplaying" might be understood via shared story-time more than a culture of gaming.

They're playing a character (who is extremely distanced from their own reality) who is playing a character (who is, again, extremely distanced from the reality of either the player or the first layer character).<br/><br/>I'd suggest that you need to give them EXTREMELY concrete goals to pursue in order to help keep them focused. Make the goals as cut-and-dried and specific as possible. Otherwise it'll be way too easy for them to get lost in a combination of scenery chewing and disconnected boredom.<br/><br/>The classic 3 goals (one easy, one challenging, and one super hard) and 3 connections (one friend, one enemy, one other) will help a lot. The easy goal could maybe be the second level character's goal. Try not to get too crazy with mixing up who is an ally in the first layer characters with who is an ally in the second layer - that will get hard to keep in your head.<br/><br/>Also, I would suggest framing the sub-game with substantial time playing the nobles both before and after. Make the sub-game pretty short and simple. Otherwise it will eat up all of the mind-space of the event and the "real characters" will be under-developed.<br/><br/>Motivations:<br/><br/>Flirting (a specific version of your number 2). But make the flirting goal-oriented. Like they want to secure a rendezvous or engagement or something.<br/><br/>For your number 1, proving a point, I'd suggest making it concrete. Like you're trying to prove your point to a specific other player and if they are convinced, they will give you a thing that they would otherwise give someone else, who is trying to convince them of the counter point. (And make the giving an actual tangible transaction, not just words. Otherwise people say "well, I promised him I was going to give him the thing, but really I'm not going to" which gets horribly annoying.)<br/><br/>To harm someone. But include a trigger so that they can't possibly know who their target is until halfway through the game (so that they don't end up taking someone out early on). This also gives your number 5 more traction - the person is trying to protect the victim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405370/#Comment_405370" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T09:51:14+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  9:51AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about trying to win a wager?

The internal game is also limited to a certain physical space: only choir characters are obligated to attend, and this, too, only on a specific act. <br/>The internal game will be much simpler than the external game, with many characters who have group goals instead of personal goals.<br/><br/>Would you consider this simplified enough, or should it be made even less demanding?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405570/#Comment_405570" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T09:48:10+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  9:48AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like you are taking into consideration the things I had concerns about.
