However, I tend to dislike it.  <br/><br/>It is intended for GMs, and seems to be all about classifying scenes as procedural or dramatic.  However, I feel that some of my favorite scenes are the ones where a character's dramatic choices are revealed through their actions in pursuit of goals, rather than talked about.  My favorite fight scenes are those where the action reveals character, rather than just being about defeating the enemy.  While Hamlet's Hit Points acknowledges this to some degree, I feel like the approach of classifying scenes encourages more of a split and less mixing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311389/#Comment_311389" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T01:25:28+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  1:25AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the action written into the plays?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311394/#Comment_311394" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T02:33:37+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  2:33AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 2:40AM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, definitely. There are many different things happening in the final fight scene.<br/><br/>There's quite a danger in classifying scenes. For example, Robin classifies To Be Or Not To Be with a downwards arrow: an emotional defeat for Hamlet. But is it? It's also Hamlet stirring himself into action, working through philosophical issues and debating with the audience. <br/><br/>Later, Hamlet's advice to the players ("Trippingly on the tongue") doesn't even get a classification. Robin interprets this as Shakespeare having a comic interlude. But it's not just that: it's also Hamlet ensuring his trap will spring. And self-referential moments are important in RPGs. Shouldn't the classification system cope with it?<br/><br/>Actually, though, my major issue with Hamlet's Hit Points is that it doesn't specify which Hamlet it uses as its source text. There are two main ones, Quarto and Folio, and they're significantly different. For example, To Be Or Not To Be occurs at different locations in each. The two plays have different feels to them.<br/><br/>This really matters: if you're going to use Hamlet as a classic text, you've got to acknowledge that the text itself is problematic.<br/><br/>I actually quite like Hamlet's Hit Points, you understand, but that also means it's good enough to criticize.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311483/#Comment_311483" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T10:48:24+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 10:48AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I actually quite like Hamlet's Hit Points, you understand, but that also means it's good enough to criticize.</blockquote>\nWhat do you like about it, Graham?

There are a few side panels that discuss applying the book's theories to gaming but the bulk of practical advice in terms of RPGs comes in a sparse 6 page chapter called "Applying the System." And out of those 6 pages, a good portion of them are spent saying things similar to, "analyze stories you like with this book" and "write your own pre-plotted stories with the beat system described in this book". I was, and I know many people were, hoping that this chapter was much more expansive.<br/><br/>The literary theory is great for beginners and if that's your main interest you will like Hamlet's Hit Points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311603/#Comment_311603" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T01:43:20+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  1:43AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, what I like, to be honest, is the insane and weird scholarship.

But at a glance, all it was doing was going through Hamlet (and maybe another story or two?) and deconstructing it as if it were an RPG. Yeah, it was a little bit of the case of the expectations set on the cover not matching what was inside.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311633/#Comment_311633" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T06:41:04+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  6:41AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other two are Dr No and Casablanca but they aren't desconstructed as though they were RPGs, they are discontructed into narrative beats. It's about understanding how a narrative works and is a step in Robin's programme to create an RPG which explicitly takes into account dramatic beats as well as action beats.<br/><br/>Current narrative RPGs work the other way round and create a framework from which dramatic beats emerge without necessarily explicitly saying how this is to happen, nor having mechanics which support this idea. For example, it's perfectly possible to play 3:16 with none of the dramatic beats and many groups pass by this aspect because it's not made explicit. However it does take the game to a whole other level of interest. Misery Bubblegum has the (misnamed) yes/no cards which mechanically create a dramatic beat although it's not very well explained.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358227/#Comment_358227" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T14:18:59+00:00" title="February  7, 2012  2:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having just gotten this, I'm sharing some of your disappointment that the text <i>seems</i> mostly about analysis rather than guidance for role-playing games.  But on second glance, there's actually quite a bit of RPG-related content, but sprinkled randomly through the book as sidebar-like inserts.  I got a fair bit out of the book just by reading all of these in succession.<br/><br/>I think there's a relationship between being inclined to look at stories this way and the "guaranteed outcome" of GUMSHOE; that type of system makes it a lot easier to control the beats.  In a game where success and failure are to a degree random, as a GM, I think I'd have my hands full just tracking whether a given beat was 'up' or 'down' on the fly.<br/><br/>The point of hope and fear, I'd say, is to engage the players and draw them in, so this lens is one way to think about how engaged the players are. Two factors come to mind that make RPG a lot different from film, that seem very relevant.<br/><br/>One is that with such a tiny audience (say, five, compared to the thousands or millions that see a film) it doesn't make sense to talk about how a narrative analyst would classify the beats.  The real meat is in how the players were feeling about the beats as they happened.  One of Robin's side bars hints at this, the good-natured teasing of a player about his equipment, but I think he misses the point.  He points out that this seems like 'up commentary', but in retrospect is actually 'down', since the player has less emotional capital (I forget his wording) as a result.  But this beat illustrates the very subjective nature - the beat can be <i>up</i> for everyone else, but <i>down</i> for the victim.<br/><br/>Secondly, the players aren't purely audience, they're also authors.  My sense is that the 'up' or 'down' nature of a beat isn't just about what happens to the characters, but also how that's determined.  NPC allies turning up might be a procedural up beat, but to the player who has just failed to overcome the villain on his own, might feel like a de-protagonizing downbeat.<br/><br/>I am hooked, nevertheless.  One reason is that a particularly uncomfortable couple of sessions as a player really makes sense in this analysis - we basically had a long, long run of downbeats.  An infiltration went bad, we were exposed and had to flee; we failed to avoid capture, then we failed to escape, then we failed to eke out a number of concessions from our captors on a long wilderness journey.  Very frustrating!  Would it have felt different if the GM had inserted some up beats?<br/><br/>The central formula seems to be to mix up and down beats.  I'm curious <i>why</i> this causes engagement.  What struck me is that an easiest way to avoid long sequences of up and down beats is to distribute them randomly - which made me wonder, in turn, whether we get hooked by this unpredictability.  (As happens with gambling, or in abusive relationships - the mixture of good and bad feedback foils our pattern matching and we stay hooked, hoping that mastering the skill is just around the corner, which it never is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358231/#Comment_358231" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T14:43:31+00:00" title="February  7, 2012  2:43PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didnt get much out of it and it seemed to be a book that could have easilly been a two page article.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358254/#Comment_358254" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T17:16:30+00:00" title="February  7, 2012  5:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2012 5:17PM by jenskot.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fuseboy</cite>The central formula seems to be to mix up and down beats.  I'm curious<i>why</i>this causes engagement. </blockquote>\nThe secret ingredient is contrast (in my opinion).<br/><br/>Specifically contrast that doesn't break suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>This is how drama, horror, and comedy work. It's effective because our minds are amazing at recognizing patterns and filling blanks. We make assumption once we establish patterns; which is why repetition can become boring as we pay less and less attention while contrast is exciting because it breaks the patterns in our minds and forces us to pay attention. <br/><br/>Artists use this trick frequently when it comes to shading. A drawing's highlights are often placed next to the areas that are the darkest to create exciting contrast. Actors will speak low right before they are about speak loudly. Movies will be still before there is sudden motion. Cameras will pan slowly in one direction before suddenly and quickly shifting to another direction. <br/><br/>Horror and comedy: 1. Introduce something. 2. Establish a pattern with repetition, creating expectations. 3. Create excitement (or surprise or shock) by breaking or twisting the established pattern and shattering the associated expectations. Introduce, reinforce, break.<br/><br/>My biggest takeaway from Hamlet's Hit Points is that it is more important to create contrast for the real people at the gaming table than for their characters. Even if we transcribed the game's fiction, and it later read as if there was adequate contrast (ups and downs) between scenes or moments\u2026 it doesn't matter because we aren't writing a script for someone to read. It doesn't matter if the GM plans contrast in their prep. Their prep isn't what happens at the table. Create contrast, moment to moment, using what's actually happening in real time. <br/><br/>Were things just slow\u2026 speed them up. Were things fast\u2026 wait\u2026 don't slow down yet, after that fast scene we just played we called for a 5 minute break. You can't decide when it is appropriate to create ups and downs based on just scenes. We just spent 5 minutes eating, smoking, or in the bathroom. We may have a natural low that has nothing to do with the game. So don't start the next scene with a down because the last scene was an up because that doesn't account for the real life down of taking a break.<br/><br/>Contrast works because we find patterns and fill in the blanks. That's also why long descriptions are boring (and probably why the length of this post is boring). Half way through your description everyone may have a solid idea of what you're describing and any more detail will just feel like a drag. <br/><br/>When I draw 4 connected lines our minds say "square" or "box". We fill in the blank even though it's just 4 lines. I like to think of descriptions in the same way. Just draw (describe) enough so the players can fill in the rest. Say I want to describe a city. My 4 lines might be "tall buildings", "honking car horns", " crowded sidewalks", "rumbling from an underground subway". Because we recognize patterns, players will fill in the blank with "city" in their minds (or something close enough). Any more and we get boring fast. And once we've established, then reinforced the idea of a city (and normalcy) we can easily amp up excitement by using contrast to twist and break expectations. <br/><br/>Of course none of this touches how important using pauses is. Pausing between reinforcing and then breaking patterns can be extremely dramatic as we build anticipation, let our minds wonder what will happen, and then hit us in the face with a pleasing dose of contrast. <br/><br/>Strangely\u2026 boredom can also be a useful technique! Especially if you aren't boring too long and the level of excitement that follows is especially exciting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358288/#Comment_358288" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T00:10:47+00:00" title="February  8, 2012 12:10AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I didnt get much out of it and it seemed to be a book that could have easilly been a two page article.</blockquote>\nFirst part, fair enough.
