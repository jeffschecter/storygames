These games have been created by cross-disciplinary teams from around the world. </blockquote>\nGfC is in NYC on June 20-22. Unfortunately registration is closed. That said, the list of games look incredible and many of them can be played online: <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/play" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamesforchange.org/play</a><br/><br/>Examples...\n<blockquote>3rd World Farmer is a simulation that illustrates the plight of poor farmers in unstable and impoverished countries. Players take the role of a desperate farming family and attempt to survive as long as possible while contending with disasters, wars, poor medical care, and unfair prices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Against All Odds is about the global refugee experience from the time people are forced to leave their countries of origin to the beginning of their new life abroad. A series of short challenges illustrates the complexity and danger of the refugee experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Ayiti: The Cost of Life is a game that challenges its players to manage a rural family of five in Haiti over four years and keep them healthy, get them educated, and help them survive. Developed in a unique partnership between youth in an after school program and a professional game developer, the game has been played over a half million times and has proven to be a hit as both an engaging game and as a tool for education. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Play all three branches of the U.S. government and experience the powers (and limitations!) of each branch while learning the rules and regulations in the law making process. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Play as the President of Europe from 2000 to 2100, and attempt to reduce your carbon emissions while maintaining vital national services and remaining popular with the electorate. This single-player strategy game, based on real-world scientific data, allows you to learn about environmental issues by experimenting with different approaches for fighting climate change. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Explore the Bill of Rights while owning and operating your own constitutional law firm! Hire lawyers with special talents and areas of expertise and assign them to distraught clients with legal quandaries of varying validity. Wield the Bill of Rights like a high power microscope, examine a variety of fun and quirky legal cases, and ultimately become a prestigious purveyor of expert legal advice. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Early Warning, Early Action is a card game commissioned by The Red Cross designed to surface ideas and issues around flood preparedness and increasing climate instability. The pilot of this game was played in Doune Baba Dieye by Red Cross staff, climate scientists and villagers and helped generate over 300 new ideas about how to better help this small African community prevent easily identifiable disasters. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>A first-person, 3D adventure game, Escape from Woomera invites players to assume the character of a modern-day refugee, and live through his or her experiences in Australia's brutal immigration and refugee detention centers. <br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Fatworld is a video game about the politics of nutrition. It explores the relationships between obesity, nutrition, and socioeconomics in the contemporary U.S. Fit or Fat? Live or Die? You Decide. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Global Conflicts: Palestine is a 3D role-playing game for players to explore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They will be confronted with issues around human rights, terrorism and the media\u2019s role in conflict zones and will experience situations taken from real life events that are more complicated than outsiders may realize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Harpooned is a Cetacean Research Simulator, where you play the role of a Japanese scientist performing research on whales around Antarctica.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In the 1988 political simulator Hidden Agenda, you are the new president of Chimerica (a fictive country in Central America). You have been chosen after the citizens overthrew the evil dictator Farsante. Choose your ministers and decide on new policies -- but be careful, as your policies may lead your country to a worse situation than it suffered under your predecessor. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Homeland Guantanamos is a game designed to spotlight the inhumane conditions faced by 300,000 people in immigrant detention as a result of unfair DHS policies. Players assume the role of an undercover journalist who must uncover the true story of an immigrant who died in ICE custody under questionable circumstances. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hush is an experimental game in which you play a young mother trying to calm her crying infant with a lullaby. The controls are straightforward: press keys in a gentle rhythm as letters emerge on the screen. The world beyond your window, however, is not so simple. You live in a Rwandan Tutsi community, and Hutu soldiers have come to raid your village. Continue singing, stay steady, and shield your child from the terrible events that surround you, and you both might survive the night. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Now you can be the protagonist of the petroleum era: explore and drill around the world, corrupt politicians, stop alternative energies and increase the oil addiction. Be sure to have fun before the resources begin to deplete. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Re-Mission is a video game that gives young people with cancer a sense of power and control over their disease. It's a fun, effective tool that improves treatment adherence, cancer knowledge and self-efficacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Real Lives 2010 is the latest version of the Real Lives simulation that enables you to live a life in any country of the world, all based on real world statistics. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>In the art game Sixteen Tons, four players play a strategy game using heavy sections of steel pipe as game pieces. Players cannot move their own pieces and must use the other players to move their pieces for them. The game acts as a metaphor about the exploitation of labor and debt bondage since players must bribe one another to help them win. As the game goes on, tactics and player behavior changes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The ReDistricting Game educates, engages, and empowers citizens around the issue of congressional redistricting. As is illustrated in the game, our system is subject to a range of manipulations and helps fuel long-term political polarization in the U.S. Those empowered to change the system \u2013 congress - have the least incentive to do so. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Train is an art "board game", played on a broken, six-paned glass window with three train tracks as the "game board." Players must move their train from one end of the track to the other, while transporting yellow game pieces. It isn\u2019t until the first player reaches the end that players realize the game is a metaphor for the transportation of Jewish captives to concentration camps during the Holocaust. This new context challenges the players\u2019 morality and encourages them to creatively use the game rules to undermine the intended process of the game, effectively allowing them to \u201csave\u201d their game pieces. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329119/#Comment_329119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T07:36:12+00:00" title="June 11, 2011  7:36AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2011 7:52AM by jenskot.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just found out... every day you volunteer to work a shift, you can attend the rest of that day for free (3 day event passes were like $500).

Thank you.<br/><br/>I find some of the games more interesting than others. The one about petroleum running out, for example: well, I see the assumptions going into that game and I don't imagine I'll find it persuasive.<br/><br/>But then the simulation games, like the refugee one, I find rather fascinating.

Take <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/play/guess-my-race" rel="nofollow">Guess My Race</a> for example. <br/><br/>Several of these games didn't have fixed win states. You could say they weren't games at all but more interactive exercises. I thought a portion of the games were too obvious coming from an arguably questionable perspective. But a few were emotional, eye opening, and provocative in a, "I want to learn more about this" way. <br/><br/>Could they have done better? 100%. But they are taking the first step and learning. Plenty of people would rather they try different approaches but aren't willing or able to put their own advice into real world effect.

To know that designers are working in this field, with vigor and engagement, is good for me as a game-smith. It broadens the perspective on my own design too. To sharpen our "design claws", and make use of them for good, is an idea I fully support (even though, as you, I do not see eye to eye with all that is created under such a label).<br/><br/>This weekend I will attend a seminar on "storytelling as healing", and do so with the idea that it may come to reshape my way of designing modern role-playing games. To design games for change is, for me, second nature to designing games at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331289/#Comment_331289" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T05:58:57+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  5:58AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cathexis</cite>I think it's the fairly standard issue of games attempting to simulate life but fall short by: having an agenda (here's a game to show you that being fat is bad!), having a fixed win state (uncover the mystery of how interrogation centers are bad!), or simplifying the world down into a game rule set (play a rhythm game well enough and you won't end up dead!).  Getting people to talk about hard issues is a great thing but it feels disingenuous to boil down very real issues into games with an end state.</blockquote>\nSo my just-completed (as much as such things are ever completed) thesis work was in the "games for change/games for good" space, and this set of issues is exactly what I was wrestling with while working on it. There's a really interesting tension between things that games do well and things that games do badly, when set against what motivates people and what alienates people.<br/><br/>(for the sake of this post, let's assume I'm talking about a well-designed game. a bad game isn't going to help anyone do anything) <br/><br/>The route I chose to take (because I think it's most effective) is to downplay ideology and focus on modeling systems. Games are really good at modeling complex systems in such a way that the concepts embedded in those systems can be easily absorbed by the players. So, you're sitting around, playing this game that models (for example) modern industrial food production, and it's a fun game, and then at some point you look down and see a combination of elements that mirrors something in the real world (like, an organic grocery store selling food sourced from CAFO farms, or something), and then (this is key!) you can connect that image to something you've read or seen or experienced in your life - suddenly the game becomes a way to explore the system and reveal those ironies without having to become an expert in the subject, do a bunch of reading, or whatever.<br/><br/>A critical component, for me, was focusing on individual knowledge and what an individual can reasonably be expected to do. Just telling someone "hey, eat more vegetables, they're good for you" is patronizing and ineffective. Giving them a game that enables them to reduce their vegetable waste while avoiding household chores, and oh yah it only works if you eat some green stuff - that seems more effective to me.<br/><br/>So I think there's a middle ground of games that can teach players about real issues, spur them to change their individual behavior for the better, and start a process that will contribute to real change, absolutely. Of course there's going to be a lot of failures, on both ends of the spectrum, trying to figure out the most effective way to do it. But I'm glad people are trying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331325/#Comment_331325" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T12:01:31+00:00" title="June 23, 2011 12:01PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2011 12:44PM by Valamir.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>The route I chose to take (because I think it's most effective) is to downplay ideology and focus on modeling systems.

Downplaying the ideology sounds like an ideal, but any model of a complex system by definition has to make certain abstractions and assumptions in order to simplify the system into a graspable model.  I'm having trouble envisioning a way that that can happen that doesn't inherently represent the ideology of the person creating the model.  At some point choices get made about what to abstract, what to emphasize, how to simplify interaction of variables, etc.<br/><br/>For disclosure and relevant to this topic:  I believe that objective journalism is a myth.  All journalism is inherently biased right from the selection of what stories to report, what details to include in the first 3 paragraphs, and what headline to put on it.  Given that, I've concluded that its better to not try to be objective but to clearly identify the biases that you're bringing to the story (frex I can read the same story at Huff Post and at Fox News and because I know what innaccurate spin each site is trying to put on it I can get closer to the truth than either one alone).<br/><br/>My first inclination then is to think the same would be true of Games for Change.  That it would be better not to downplay the ideology inherent in these games but instead to make explicit and up front which principals are being modeled (a third world economic game will be a very different experience if the economics are built on a Keynesian model vs. an Austrian model).  <br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331457/#Comment_331457" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T08:08:05+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  8:08AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good question, Ralph. By "downplaying," I don't really mean "trying to eliminate" - more like, "not make it the selling point," I guess. <br/><br/>For (a self-aggrandizing) Example! <a href="http://www.ndpdesign.com/play-with-your-food/single-gallery/10111897" rel="nofollow">Feed Them!</a> is a strategic resource-management board game that models modern industrial food production through the use of puzzle-piece like tiles. Each piece abstracts and represents some part of the system. Now, personally, I think that some of those parts are objectively worse than others (like, CAFO farms are depressing and terrible on pretty much every level). However, CAFOs are really really important to our system, so it gets a tile, and (more importantly) a <i>useful</i> tile in some circumstances. In this sense, I did my best to downplay my personal preferences in service to being as honest as I could to what I was trying to represent, and of course make a game that would actually be fun to play.<br/><br/>But, my personal ideology is certainly reflected by some of the less visible mechanism - for example, Social Health is keyed mainly to means of production, Economic Health is more fragile in terms of how much it can be effected by interventions mid-game, stuff like that. If you played over time, patterns would emerge that would reveal my ideology, and could be argued with or against. But on it's face, it's not a game about how our system is terrible; it's a game about how our system is <i>complicated</i>, which is a very different thing.<br/><br/>Now, this is different than <a href="http://www.ndpdesign.com/play-with-your-food/single-gallery/10111897" rel="nofollow">Dinner Winner</a>, which is much more up-front about the message. This game says "hey, people should eat more fresh fruit and vegetables, because they're better for you." Thats the reason it exists. However, the game itself (such as it is) is a layer of the system that isn't actually necessary to use the magnets to do useful things like track freshness and find new things you usually don't eat. With the ideology on it's sleeve, that means some people will look at it and go "that's stupid, I would never use that," which is fine. It's for the people who do find something attractive about gamifying their vegetable consumption.<br/><br/>I hope that makes some sense! <br/><br/>TL;DR - I basically agree with Ralph, but I was using downplay to mean "locate on a specific level of the game depending on your goals" not "eliminate entirely"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331465/#Comment_331465" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T09:43:23+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  9:43AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2011 9:49AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>My first inclination then is to think the same would be true of Games for Change.

We are talking about people who actively want to bring about change, right?  I understand that journalists want to change the world as well, but their primary motivation (reporting) is different than an artist or game designer with an agenda. For the latter group, they have to choose the method of design that is going to be most effective towards their goal. And I think that one of the problems with wearing your politics on your sleeve is that you can either (a) end up preaching to the choir only, or (b) giving people who play your game an easy out. Let me explain.<br/><br/>If a game says on the cover (in some unimaginable marketing speak) that it is based on Keynesian economics rather than Austrian economics, then the anti-Keyensian people are likely to pass up the game as nothing more than propaganda.  Likewise, even if they play your game, and enjoy it as a game, they may ignore the game's political message because, again, to them it's nothing more than propaganda.  The trick is to make people at least consider your game's message/agenda even if they are coming into it with preconceived notions of what is right and what is wrong.<br/><br/>I think Nathan's idea of modeling systems is a good one. I tried a similar approach with Mars Colony. My idea was to allow players the freedom to succeed with whatever political model they want to implement in the game.  Want to be a fascist? Go for it. Want to be a wide-eyed socialist?  Fine.  The game itself doesn't judge you. It simply provides you with tools to narrate a story based on whatever you put into it.  At the same time, though, the other player is set up as opposition (so that you can see the flip side of things), and the story always comes back to the personal story of Kelly Perkins (so that you can see the effect of your choices on an individual level).  Whether I succeeded or not is a question for the reader.  But the concept was to allow players to feel safe enough to explore a broad political spectrum.  Even if the game doesn't judge you, you might end up judging yourself.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, and what was my agenda? Well, for one, to show that political power, regardless of your politics, is a corrupting force. All the political party stuff is very important to the game, but ultimately a bit of a "trick" on the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331512/#Comment_331512" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T13:49:56+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  1:49PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There must be a danger, surely, that the players reverse your ideology?

Silence Keeps Me a Victim was meant to be a game for change, not that I ever encountered that title. I made quite a few mistakes, that I haven't been able to identify with words until this thread.<br/><br/>My first mistake in it's design was wanting to communicate too many things. This caused me to float around, and never get the modeling correct. Many times I wasn't even sure what it was I was trying to communicate, other than the title. The title was spot on. Over the years since I put it down, it's now two distinct game ideas, with a fuzzy third forming. I think to have success in creating a game for change, one has to have a firm idea of the message you want to communicate, and exploring that message is the point of the game. This is the mistake that Vampire's Humanity score represents, it's about telling you exactly what humanity is, rather than exploring humanity. My mechanics made the same mistake. I made one type of dice "bad," and the other type "good." Train does not make that mistake.<br/><br/>The second mistake I made was not having Nathan's advice from above and making the mechanics about creating a model to examine ideas within. As mentioned above, my mechanics were about telling you my thoughts, rather than letting you explore and come to your own conclusion. I think Games for Change will be successful if they do the later, and unsuccessful if they follow my example.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that most of the folks self-identifying as part of this movement seem to be using the uniqueness of games, in this time period, as an unfamiliar way to examine the world, to draw people in for things that are not games. What I mean to say is that most of these games don't stand alone, like say the comic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus" rel="nofollow">Maus: A Survivor's Tale</a>, or Grey Ranks, Steal Away Jordan, etc, all stand alone. I also mean that other forms of art are already familiar as ways to examine and try to teach. What do we make of this? For instance, the article about "Train" from above mentions there is always an hour or two talk afterwards. So is this games for change focus a trend, and games really have no more power to teach than books, or art? Or is there something that makes games more innately useful for change?

Either that, or you're some kind of master of persuasion. Or the game is about something so simple that this reversal isn't possible.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

But they can be one round in the chamber of the culture-creation gun, as it were, alongside novels and movies and performance and all the rest. Once documentaries happened they didn't replace writing histories. <br/><br/>My ideological position is that games are more efficient on a time-vs-effort basis for communicating a basic understanding of a complex systems than other ways of learning about them. Considering that so many of the things in the world that need to change are hideously complex systems, I think the potential is there for them to be more effective in educating and motivating the "average person" (whatever that is) than, like, publishing white papers.

But an interesting thing.</blockquote>\nNew tagline for Mars Colony: "Power is AWESOME."<br/><br/>Not to get too fuzzy, but the fact that there is the danger of players misinterpreting the message of the game, to me, means that the game is an honest design. I agree with Nathan. If that danger didn't exist, then the game would either be too simple, or a bad model of whatever system the game is modeling. When a player knows that he is free to make a choice, and is convinced to make a choice one way or another, then that choice is all the more powerful. If the player knows, or suspects, that he is being manipulated by the game designer with too heavy a touch, the player is more likely to reject whatever revelation he is supposed to be having. I think this is especially true of RPGs. My favorite Nar games are the ones that act as a tool. You can lead me towards whatever message you want me to find, but I have to get there on my own -- or at least feel like I'm getting there on my own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
