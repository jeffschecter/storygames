Otherwise I think it's called "conch shell" or "pass the stick" narration. <br/><br/>In the first case players tell the gm what they'd like their characters to do, and the GM decides (by whatever kind of judgement).

There are fairly distinct procedures to follow, however, which I suppose is a mechanic of a different sort.<br/><br/>Matrix Games primarily use verbal description, although some variants  especially the wargame ones) will at least address some sort of quantified quality as appropriate ( for example, noting range of vision or travel times), although in a very brief way. It does however have a referee who regularly calls for engagement with a die-roll resolution system of a verfy minimalist sort.<br/><br/>I understand that Prof Barker, the Tekumel guy, simply uses description with an occasional die throw where high=Good, Low=Bad and context determines how bad, how good, and what, interpreted by the GM. So, basically, the sort of thing Renatoram hates. Rumor has it he's been doing this for quite a long time now, certainly before the 90s, perhaps back to the 70s.<br/><br/>Then of course there's the old kriegspiel and frei kriegspiel, ancestors to modern wargames, that were used for training and were all about "Mother may I?" as a mechanic. I believe Elliot Wilen has tracked down similar books by American military trainers as well.<br/><br/>The upside, frankly, is ease of play, especially with new people who aren't gamers. It's also less to hide behind in terms of authority. The GM ( or another player) makes the call they think is right based on what they've understood or imagined, and that tends to get accepted or rejected straight out.<br/><br/>A downside, and one not much mentioned, is that these don't leave much written record. I mean, after a brief description of how it works, the rules boil down to : Say what you want to do, have the GM make a judgement call, use dice or other randomizer as you feel appropriate.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163983/#Comment_163983" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T06:49:40+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  6:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>Say what you want to do, have the GM make a judgement call, use dice or other randomizer as you feel appropriate. </em><br/><br/>Which arguably is the essential description of 90% of the so called "trad" games...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163986/#Comment_163986" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T07:07:46+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  7:07AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite><em>Say what you want to do, have the GM make a judgement call, use dice or other randomizer as you feel appropriate.</em><br/><br/>Which arguably is the essential description of 90% of the so called "trad" games...</blockquote>\nYou forgot "...<i>after you'vge read this 400 page tome and figured out what the system given is supposed to be like</i>"<br/><br/>There, now we have a description of 90+ % of trad games.<br/><br/>See, personally, I don't dislike the first part you quoted ( although I recognize it ain't the whole enchilada).

More like: no additional (meta-level) tools for serving story, drama and suspense and so on to the game. Works, if the players are able to act together, in order to bring that kind of stuff to the play. Requires player skill and techniques that work together.

Which you can call storytelling, improve theater (which I would say does have some mechanics), or whatever.<br/><br/>We couldn't play it since it's no longer a game. The methods to help create great stories would be the same ones that storytellers use. Knowing about Act structure, how to create compelling characters, when to use and avoid traditional story structure, ways to build tension and conflict, etc.<br/><br/>It would not open new RPG oppurtunities since it's no longer an RPG. It certainly opens doors, as it allows you to turn to millenia of theater and story development and make it more directly applicable. It also closes some doors, since the division between player, character and the influence of mechanics allows for a unique way to tell and experience stories not possible in other mediums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164155/#Comment_164155" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T12:53:54+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 12:53PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite><em>Especially if there was some direction on "Say yes..." type techniques and general behavioral advice.</em><br/><br/>And that would not be a mechanic, why?<br/><br/>Polaris: "But only if..."<br/><br/>That's a mechanic.</blockquote>\nI'm sure that is a mechanic in the case of Polaris.

As it is resolved with no mechanical means, it would not be mechanics, no.<br/><br/>Here is my take on how a classical roleplaying game may be broken down:<br/><i><b>- setting elements:</b> society, politics, NPCs, locations, monsters, cosmology<br/><b>- plot elements:</b> situations, conflicts, hooks, motivations<br/><b>- character elements:</b> names, titles, tools, trades, manners, family &amp; friends<br/><b>- leadership:</b> invitation, trust, authority, group dynamics, atmosphere, starting and steering the discourse<br/><b>- material elements:</b> character sheets, maps, dice and/or cards, table, room, costumes, food &amp; drink<br/><b>- system elements:</b> conflict mechanics (the use of dice and/or cards), interaction drivers, simulation tools, consequence meters</i><br/><br/>The totality of this is what I call a game method. As you see the "mechanics" are but a minor part of it. Hope this clarifies.<br/><br/><b>Mind you: </b>in my view designers of classical roleplaying games have focused too much of their energies (and book space) on the system elements (an old complaint, yes), so if you are to heed this list of mine; <i>please do so by discussing the other points in the list</i> and how those elements may be used to make games without mechanics.<br/><br/><i>Sidenote: I'm designing games with mechanics myself, so I have no quarrel with such design.

I'd stick to playing the finished ones and just glance over the others for ideas.<br/><br/>Yeah, I haven't quite figured out the best way to categorize things in this design area yet. There's heavily-GM-centric stuff like Amber and the non-dice-centric parts of Engle Matrix Games. There's resource-distribution based games like Nobilis and Marvel Universe.  There's formalized negotiation systems like Polaris, Mridangam, and Mist-Robed Gate.  There's the lead-with-the-narrative stuff that Vincent's doing.  There are games that generate content and results through visual, board-game elements, like Avatar, Zombie Cinema, It's Complicated, Transantiago, and Mwaantaangaand (and Grey Ranks, kinda, though it uses fortune as well).  I might count Bacchanal in the latter group too, because it's glass of dice serves a similar function.  There's a group that's still somewhat vague (at least to me) that does thing more like Jeep, setting up a variety of situations and social structures and then cutting the players lose to resolve them.  And then there's a bunch of games that are currently still fairly unique and don't have clearly associated games with which to form a category.<br/><br/>All in all though, I'm really excited.  I really love this style of design and it's great to see so many folks fiddling with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164424/#Comment_164424" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T12:27:05+00:00" title="August 22, 2008 12:27PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Yeah, I haven't quite figured out the best way to categorize things in this design area yet.

I have really not tried to, actually. Over here we are a bit more into making whatever games we can, and test them on eachother, being supportive all the way. Some years ago we had lengthy theory- and definition-discussions, some of them related to Forge theory, but that has calmed down in recent years. Instead we have had an explosion of new games.<br/><br/>But that aside: you write very informed and interesting on various games in this field of RPG-design. I would love to meet you face to face, to discuss experiments and experiences with roleplaying games of this kind, diving into the stuff in a joint venture to unearth any principles there may be at the bottom of it. Come over here in april, to the <i>Knutepunkt</i>-convention (official language: English) in Oslo (my hometown). That will be a great venue for such a discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164627/#Comment_164627" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T14:56:50+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  2:56PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 2:59PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read <b>Dulse </b>by Jason Morningstar now, and that is really a very nice game of the type I'm talking about. It's all about character, relationships, and principles. <br/><br/>I see that he could make it simpler still, and that he by simplifying it would make it a better game (supposedly). I reckon that if he had played the wonderfully elegant <i>"Until we sink ..."</i>, by Magnus Jakobson, he would have taken the use of written scene cards to heart, and used a similar technique to strenghten the gameplay of Dulse (again: supposedly).<br/><br/>However: I really liked reading this game, as it connects with the stuff I'm doing myself in my modern games: focusing on human interrelations. It's all in the word: <i>interrelation </i>is too close to <i>interaction </i>to be ignored as THE best focal-point for roleplaying games. And if you <i>do </i>make interrelations your focal-point, then you need only set the direction for the players, giving them a framework for the the gameplay, and great drama will grow by itself.<br/><br/>You really don't need mechanics at all to do that (you may use mechanics, but it is important to know that you may do without).<br/><br/>Let grown ups play, but give them <i>grown up toys</i> to play with, so they may play their souls up on the table!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164630/#Comment_164630" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T15:00:06+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  3:00PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tomas, I agree that <i>Dulse </i>could be simpler and probably should be.

The group will make decisions concerning bylaws and game rules by parliamentary procedure.<br/>\n2. Any player may contribute or modify story elements at any time. The story comprises all elements in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had several rule-mod proposals lined up for us to vote on (including one that detailed what "parliamentary procedure" meant, and one that defined a "canon" of story elements that would trump non-canon elements), but they turned out largely to be unnecessary. I expected (and kind of hoped) that we would generate a "system" as we needed it, but it turned out we largely didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe only played for three sessions. I got us on track telling the story of a dwarf kingdom (I got the notion from playing too much Dwarf Fortress). The sessions felt like collaborative DMing: no one was yet willing to take on the roles of characters by the end of the third session. I expect that would have changed eventually, or it might have been different if we played more often (sessions were three weeks apart). We gave it up for scheduling reasons. I consider the experiment a surprising success -- "surprising" insofar as I thought we would have to change those two rules above pretty much as soon as we began play, but in fact we didn't have to change them at all, and immediately focused on the story pretty much exclusively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164809/#Comment_164809" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T14:44:08+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  2:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Freeform games can be lots of fun, but they can be pretty boring too.

I believe that will be a road all by itself, discussing realism in roleplaying games. We'll have to do that in another thread, sometime ...<br/><br/>I prefer to use the term "method" in these discussions, as I consider the term "system" to be misguiding. It has normative force, and is at the same time descriptive: pertaining to classical roleplaying games as we know them.<br/><br/><b>System </b>points to the concrete and systematic <i>rules </i>in the tradition of roleplaying games.<br/><br/><b>Method </b>points to <i>the way we play</i>, opening up for tools pertaining to group dynamics, psychology and verbal manipulation.<br/><br/>Norwegian game designers has blossomed partly due to us discussing RPGs with other terms from the 90ties and onward, opening up for original takes on how to make game methods. We have ended up making games based on different principles than the traditional one, while at the same time beginning to understand more of the classical RPG too.<br/><br/>The same is true for the Danish scenario-design. Some of the Danish designers have left traditional system-thinking and gone for a totally new approach. They call it "free form", but in fact these de-facto <i>roleplaying games</i> are as methodical as any other game. The stringent method found in some of the Danish "scenarios" makes them full and beautiful roleplaying games in their own right.<br/><br/>Sorry for casting a Nordic light over this discussion. It may be that my ramblings are hard to understand. Hope some of it makes sense to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7371/games-with-no-mechanical-values" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7371/games-with-no-mechanical-values" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7371/games-with-no-mechanical-values/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7371%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7371%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
