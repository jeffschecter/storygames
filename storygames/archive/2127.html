                    Second session of The Mountain Witch totally rocked â€“ I basically just wound the players up and let them go, and they provided almost all of the tension and a good part of the narration to boot, between one Fate and another.  The last half of the session was particularly awesome.<br/><br/>I opened up the session with the revelation that the kindly woodcutter and his wife and eldest daughter were actually goblins with detachable heads.  The heads, as Yoshi/Tim discovered, were floating about in the garden arguing about whether they could eat the ronin before they woke up and put up a fight.  Sadako/Josh C. woke and found the headless bodies, with the mysterious exception of Hiroko, the youngest daughter.  Kenzo/Shy used his bondage ability to tie up the goblins' bodies, and the goblins were promised a quick and clean death if they would give the ronin information about O-Yanma.  They complied, and Tim narrated that they revealed there was a temple halfway up the mountain where a forest spirit had been imprisoned by O-Yanma, and there might be a magical brooch there that would offer protection against O-Yanma's magics.  Meanwhile, Sadako attempted to discover where Hiroko had gone, only to find that the child's footprints turned into those of a cat halfway across the clearing.  She wisely decided to leave it there.<br/><br/>Ichi/Josh M. was placed as sentry, and the rest of the crew fell asleep.  The goblin-wife asked Ichi if he was the one who was in league with the Witch.  He said yes, and she asked if he had a token.  He entered into a social contest and convinced her that receiving visions from O-Yanma was good enough.  She told him that the path the group planned on taking was guarded by a giant who would not let them pass if they didn't bear a token from the Witch.  In exchange for this information, Ichi promised to read poetry at her death, in order to ease her passage.<br/><br/>Yoshi and Yasu/Hannah overheard this exchange, and lost no time in revealing what they'd heard to the rest.  Ichi insisted, of course, that he was just going along with the goblin in order to gain information, and revealed that he actually was once pledged to be married to the woman who is now Yuki-Onna.  He's still in love with her, of course.  After some argument over whether packs should be searched (they decided not to) and a conflict over which path to take, the group decided to take the path indicated by the goblin-wife.  The goblins were executed at dawn, and the ronin continued.<br/><br/>When they stopped to rest at noon, Sadako slipped away into the trees, and Yoshi followed her.  He saw her remove the bundle from her back, unwrap it... and proceed to apparently suckle an infant (â€œWHOA!!â€ said everyone around the table).  Disturbed, he backed away, and then decided to make it appear as though he had just started looking for Sadako, calling out her name.  She hid her bundle and returned to camp with him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Yasu made a small fire and, as usual, burned small pieces of his coat in offering.  Shitake/Dave successfully used his passing-through-shadows ability to enter the flickering fire and emerge in Yasu's demon's world.  He and the demon bantered back and forth, and finally the demon presented him with a dagger that â€œmight come in handy.â€  The coolest thing was when Hannah narrated that the demon looked just like Yasu â€“ but was almost naked, except for the pieces of clothing that Yasu had burned in offering.<br/><br/>After this, Yasu transformed into a turkey vulture in order to scout the area and find the shrine.  He located the shrine, but found that there was an encampment of samurai in the vicinity.  On the way back, he was attacked by a raven, and succeeded in bringing it down to earth, where it transformed into a tengu.  The tengu admitted that it was a scout for the samurai, the Fujiwara clan, who are allies of O-Yanma.  He stated that if he didn't return, they would send more scouts out after him, but Yasu chose to have his demon send the tengu very far away (the demon chose China) in exchange for a large piece of his coat.<br/><br/>Yasu rejoined the rest and they began to make their way toward the shrine.  Halfway there, Josh M. narrated a waylaying by a group of eight samurai, all dressed in armor that appeared to be made of ice.  They were of the Fujiwara clan, and knew Ichi.  There was a battle, with Sadako and Kenzo taking on the general, and everyone else fighting the rest of the soldiers.  They won easily, and the general was mortally wounded with an arrow through the throat.  Ichi tried to question him about Yuki-Onna, but the man could only make terrible gargling noises, and then Sadako finished him off, much to Ichi's chagrin.                </div>

                            Things REALLY got going when they got to the temple.  There were two sentries at the entrance, and Sadako and Shitake took them out easily.  When they entered, however, they encountered a lion dog directly inside the door.  Yasu took it out fairly easily, but not before it raised the alarm by roaring loudly.  Inside the temple was the forest spirit, who was in the form of an old man, bound to a chair by iron bonds.  His eyes flared when he saw Yoshi, who he seemed to recognize.  Shitake explained that they were here to release the spirit, and also retrieve the brooch that would help ensure safe passage to the Mountain Witch's fortress.  The spirit said that he would welcome release, but stated that there was one among them who did not desire the Witch's destruction.  He also said that the Fujiwara clan had removed the brooch and the rest of the treasure.<br/><br/>At this point, six samurai dropped through the roof, and more tried to enter through the door, although it was narrow enough that only two could fit through.  Kenzo and Sadako took care of the door, Shitake moved to free the forest spirit, Ichi attacked the other six samurai (receiving a chapter wound and dealing out a flesh wound), Yasu attempted (and succeeded) in transforming into a viper, and... Yoshi attacked and killed the forest spirit!  This conflict played out beautifully; I'd been rolling crap dice for most of the session, but this time I scored a six â€“ and so did Tim.  Tim took Ai-Uchi and narrated that Yoshi was successful in killing the spirit, but was incapacitated in the process -- the resulting magical backlash blew him through the door and he was impaled on a broken timber.  Shitake, Ichi, and Yasu cleaned up the remaining samurai (very nice narration of Shitake using viper-Yasu as a whip...).  Shitake then said he was going to help Yoshi.  Once he got outside, Shitake announced that he was going to sacrifice Yoshi to the forest spirits, in the hope of averting their anger and saving Yoshi from a terrible afterlife when he inevitably died from his wounds.  He and Ichi had a social duel over this; Ichi won and succeeded in convincing Shitake that they should wait to kill Yoshi until they had heard what he had to say.  Shitake agreed, â€œBut only because there is nothing he could say that would justify this.â€<br/><br/>There followed another battle with the Fujiwara samurai.  Yasu attempted to transform into something fearsome, and Hannah and I both rolled double success.  She decided her Ai-Uchi would take the form of Yasu mistakenly transforming into a whale, crushing several samurai to death, but being gravely injured and incapacitated in the process. (We were all like, â€œHannah, are you SURE?â€ and she was like, â€œYeah, it'll be cool!â€ â€œOkaaay....â€)  The rest of the ronin succeeded in killing all but a handful of the remaining samurai, who retreated, and the ronin retreated into the forest in turn to regroup (fortunately, Yasu turned back into a human when he lost consciousness).<br/><br/>The final scene of tonight's session was a very, very tense scene that left a lot of things tantalizingly unresolved.  Ichi revived Yoshi enough to question him â€“ why had he killed the forest spirit?  Yoshi said that the forest spirit had killed his daughter and destroyed his family.  Then he reached into his robes and pulled out three bones tied with thread, and mumbled something about O-Yanma promising to return his daughter to him.  At this point, Ichi said that now he agreed with Shitake; the best thing he could do would be to grant Yoshi death and pray for his soul.  Sadako stepped in and said no, saying that they were holding Yoshi to a false morality, a man's morality that destroyed lives.  Ichi and Sadako had an amazingly intense social duel, and Sadako lost.  Unhappy with this result, Sadako lunged for Ichi.  He pinned her, but backed off immediately when the bundle on Sadako's back let out a human squeak [I can't quite remember, but I think this was the result of a Partial Success roll].  At this point, Yasu's unconscious body was animated by his demon [Hannah conferred with me beforehand about this, and I reminded her that everything was restricted to her Fate â€“ she could narrate with the demon, but she couldn't do anything mechanically b/c she was incapacitated].  The demon told Sadako that she and her â€œspawnâ€ were important and said that it was most important that she remain safe.  He also implied that Yasu did not share this goal, and she should be wary of him.  Then the demon retreated, leaving everyone staring at each other in consternation.<br/><br/>I decided at this point to end the chapter, and the session, since everyone was like, â€œHoly crap, that was tiring!â€  The thing about this is that it WILL allow Yoshi a chance to recover from his incapacitation and potentially resist his being sacrificed, which means I'm not being as hardassed as I maybe should be, but on the other hand, I think there's a lot more potential for drama if he lives than if he dies.  Plus, it left everyone panting for the next session. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I did have them make any changes to their Trust points before we broke, though, so that all of the betrayals and alliances would be fresh in their minds.<br/><br/>By and large, gameplay went much more smoothly this time.  I explained how damage vs. narrated success worked, and everyone understood a lot better this time around.  When we got to the big group conflicts in the fights with the samurai, we had to pull out the book and make sure we were doing it right, but other than that it was pretty seamless.  Trust points have been deemed â€œfreaking awesome!â€ by all involved.  Something that very much pleases me is that despite the realization that more trust = winning more conflicts, everyone's decided to ignore this and truly assign trust the way that they feel their characters would, dropping peoples' trust to zero even though it might hamstring them later.<br/><br/>Dark Fates are really coming into play; Shy and Dave are the only ones who haven't brought theirs out (at least not explicitly).  I THINK Shy has â€œgreatest fear,â€ so I should maybe check in and make sure he's not having any trouble with it.  I suspect he's probably just playing things close to the vest.  Knowing Dave, he also probably has something planned that he's just not letting on.  I'm really pleased with how participatory he was today in comparison to the first session.  The decision to try to sacrifice Yoshi was particularly excellent and made everyone really happy.<br/><br/>The level of action has, I think, been really satisfying, and the tension is cranked up almost unbearably at this point.  Almost everyone has taken a turn at framing a scene in terms of their Dark Fate, and Tim/Yoshi, who initially seemed most confused by this device, has taken to it like a fish to water.  I have a feeling, too, that the sustained level of tension and action is going to have a positive effect on our other gaming, actually, since it's gotten people used to deciding to do something and then going for it, rather than waiting.                        </div>
