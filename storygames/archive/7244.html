Up until today, this hasn't been a problem. His character has had an ongoing issue with another PC, which I have considered cool. IE - Interpersonal character drama! Yay! However, today, he seemed to take it personally and shut down. It sucked. It killed the session. <br/><br/>Obviously, I'm going to have to talk to the player who is causing the irritation, see if I can get him to lay off a bit. He is the bipolar guys roommate, and apparently the bipolar guy has been a little extra irritating lately. So, I think he's taking it out on him. This is obviously not cool. <br/><br/>However, aside from that, does anyone have any advice? When he isn't in shutdown mode, he's a good player, and I'd like to keep him in the group, hopefully without any more incidents.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161103/#Comment_161103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T23:50:28+00:00" title="August  6, 2008 11:50PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've recently added a new social contract rule at my table.

Pretty much the best advice I have is to treat him like you would any other gamer in this situation.  Talk to them, see what the issue is, and try to address it as best you can.  Just remember that he is not his diagnosed medical condition.  It can be tempting to blame things on the disorder that have nothing to do with it.<br><br>On the specific instance of shutting down though, ask him what he wants the group to do when that happens.  My wife would occasionally shut down due to a mix of depression or exhaustion.  Sometimes she just needed a short break.  Other times she would bow out for the night and her character got NPCd or sidelined for a bit.  Good luck balancing the needs of your group with the needs of your players.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161141/#Comment_161141" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T08:02:45+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  8:02AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just see a lot of issues all tangled here. <br><br>First, you have this friends who has a diagnosed bipolar disorder, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15707692?dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">one of the most severe and <i>dangerous</i> forms of mental illness</a>. Make sure your friend gets treatment.<br/><br/>Next, there's his behavior in your game. He's still responsible for that. He was fine with the prodding and poking before, and now he's not. As Rich says, he isn't his disease, but his disease isn't a crutch either. I'd talk to him alone and see what's up. It might not even be a bipolar thing. Maybe he just had a headache that day.<br/><br/>Last, how do you want to prioritize this stuff. I am not suggesting there's any one right answer. Do you kick your friend out of the group if he doesn't mesh well? even if it pushes him further downward? even if it loses you a friend? Do you let him stay in the group? even if it makes your games suck occasionally? more than occasionally? even if it drives off other players? even if it destroys this game for you? Where do you draw the line?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161145/#Comment_161145" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T08:07:26+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  8:07AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2008 8:08AM by Thunder_God.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is another obvious possible solution, tell people to cut it out with inter-party strife.<br/><br/>I was in a group that totally nearly disintegrated over this, over the course of two days.

And you mention that you felt that BPG's flatmate might have been going at it kind of hard to make up for stuff going on outside the game, yeh? And that BPG hasn't been his usual self recently away from the table either? This sounds to me like a totally out of game problem. Which means I wouldn't try to tackle it with in game solutions (either of the create an in-game fictional element variety, or of the guys knock it off at the table rule variety), I think these guys need to be spoken with away from the table, in an honest, intimate fashion. <br/><br/>Now, I don't know them or your group, it might mean speaking with them separately, separately first and then together, or together right off the bat, or whatever, but since what you're seeing involves both of them, I strongly suggest speaking with both of them. <br/><br/>I do know that mental illness is something that's not accepted in western society and that people living with mental illness often get their diseases treated lightly (<i>oh, it's not a real disease, it's not even like a broken leg or anything</i>) and is often perceived as a sign of weakness (<i>maybe if you just tried harder</i>), so it's definitely tricky to talk to someone about it because they are often so used to it (and their lives coping with it) being trivialized.<br/><br/>As Adam (and Tony and Richard) pointed out, when talking to BPG, make sure not to commit the fundamental attribution error. He isn't his disease, his behaviour that day may have to do with external issues as much as it may have to do with internal issues (i.e. his shutting down could have been for any number of reasons). Same goes for BPG's flatmate, I notice that you figure his actions may have been prompted from the external reason of BPG's recent behaviour, but it's possible that the reason for him could have been something completely different as well.<br/><br/>And finally, after all is said and done, I also recommend talking to everyone else about it. Depending on how BPG and his flatmate feel about it (key key key), this can either be done with them there, without them there, individually, or as a group. See what they think, but I think it might be a little odd if everyone felt uncomfortable about what happened, and then the next time you all get together everyone does their best to pretend nothing happened.<br/><br/>EDIT: I also realize that what I'm suggesting is really hard to do. Honest intimate conversation is not easy, it's much harder than any in-game solution ever would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue" title="Metal Fatigue"><img alt="Metal Fatigue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://msen.com/~sethb/xkcd-sqrt-love.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue">Metal Fatigue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161264/#Comment_161264" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T14:39:46+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  2:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking as a bipolar gamer myself, I'd recommend treating this just as if two <i>normal human beings</i> were having interpersonal problems that were interfering with the game.

Not sure how regular he is w/ his meds though. <br/><br/>I especially appreciate the responses recommending that I not treat him as if he is his disease and that the disease is the root cause of all issues. I hadn't really been looking at it like that, partially because both he (and the room mate) is a future psychologist, and so he talks about it a lot, which kind of makes it the go-to reason for things like this. I actually think it was the primary cause here, because of how the shutdown manifested, but I think you're all right that I should treat it just the same as if both parties are 100% healthy.<br/><br/>I'll definitely talk to the non-BPG, but I don't know the BPG well enough to really get into that kind of a heart-to-heart right now. In a group setting, maybe. I may have to at some point. We'll see. I'll probably try some in-game stuff as well, just so that our game doesn't act as a catalyst for their bickering.<br/><br/>Again, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161323/#Comment_161323" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T20:19:01+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  8:19PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is a good thing.

And then there was me, with my comical lack of tact and empathy. Good times (if occasionally a little stressful...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI second the comments people have made about approaching this as you would any problem between two or more people. Ignore the fact that they talk a lot about the psychology of the situation. I imagine the bipolar guy is, to some extent, incorporating the BPD as part of his personal identity and may have a tendency to describe things in terms of that - which is pretty natural. But for your needs it's a red herring, as others have advised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
