<small>Note: This is in the "little ideas" category for a reason. It's just a little idea - not a full-blown game yet. This thread comes out of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1919" rel="nofollow">this previous one about PBEM</a>, but you need not read it if you don't want to.</small><br/><br/>So I had this idea for doing Amber on a Wiki. Not straight from Phage Press's book, but using it for inspiration.  You have the GM write up a few base pages, like Castle Amber's Entry Hall, the Pattern Chamber and other important areas in the castle, Forest Arden, Shadow Earth, maybe the Logrus Chamber. Maybe brief descriptions of some random shadows out there, like the Golden Circle.<br/><br/>Everyone who pays character points for a shadow gets to write a page for it and link it appropriately. It's their shadow; they can write whatever they want<a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/amberlinks/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=campaigns" rel="nofollow">.</a> (GM approval might be good for things like a direct link to Castle Amber...) Those who don't have Advanced Pattern are on their honor not to use the browser's View Source to track down things like hidden links in, e.g. the second period in this paragraph.<br/><br/>Everyone with Pattern can write "open" pages that other folks can screw with. They "travel" by making little pages that link together into a changing string of places until you get to your destination. (This needs guidelines, I feel.)<br/><br/>You are on your honor to only follow links to get from page to page.<br/><br/>When you get Advanced powers you get varying degrees of write access.<br/><br/>If you have a trump deck, it has its own page, which only the GM writes to unless you have Trump.<br/><br/>All conversation happens on the Discussion parts of the pages.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to do conflict resolution yet, or how/whether to handle Logrus, but the basic idea has a little bit of a hold on me.<br/><br/>--Colin                </div>

                            Some Wikis have comment sections below the entry. Could that be used for character interaction? You can basically have mini conversations logged there for you. Also, some Wikis support a chat feature that could be useful for, er, chatting.<br/><br/>As for conflict, doesn't Amber have the "I'm better than you; you lose" rules? Then it would come down to looking at whose Warfare is higher, say, and writing up the "what happens next" accordingly.<br/><br/>Oh, you <i>gotta </i>have Logrus! Maybe, just embed text/images on the Wiki page. They aren't part of the "world" of that page, but have been pulled into it. I forget how you can shadow-walk with Logrus, or can you even?<br/><br/>Totally missed that linked period. Also totally missed how it relates to Advanced Pattern. You'd definitely need a moderately extensive set of pages on how Amber rules translate to the Wiki environment.<br/><br/>Q                        </div>

                            It sounds like you've got a thought-out system for using a Wiki to maintain a catalog of shadows.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds (to me) <i>less</i> like you've thought about what sort of medium would be opened up by putting the narration and such in the same format.<br/>
<br/>
Amber does, indeed, have a fairly straight-forward system, in some ways.  Moreover, it is one of the few systems that I know that <b>actively says</b> that the GM, at least, should be able to change the plans of his characters retroactively, depending on what the players do later.  What if you actively expanded this sort of ability to <i>all players</i>?<br/>
<br/>
Like ... in a given page the players could go back and edit things where they have a clear trait advantage in the relevant category.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Benedict pulls out a knife and starts circling Brand warily.  "It's too late for anything but blood, brother."</div>
</blockquote>
... becomes this when Brand applies superior psyche to edit the conversation, and adds his own narration ...<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Benedict pulls out a knife and starts circling Brand warily.  "It's too late for this to end well, brother."<br/>
<br/>
Brand smirks.  "On the contrary, brother, everything is going <i>quite well</i> for me."  He pulls out a sword and lunges forward.</div>
</blockquote>
... becomes this when Benedict applies superior warfare to edit the tactics, and adds his own narration ...<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Benedict pulls out a gun and stands off, watching Brand warily.  "It's too late for this to end well, brother."<br/>
<br/>
Brand smirks.  "On the contrary, brother, everything is going <i>quite well</i> for me."  He pulls out a sword and lunges forward.<br/>
<br/>
Benedict pulls the trigger.  A sudden poppy-like burst of blood opens on Brand's throat, and the madman falls in a heap.</div>
</blockquote>
Heh.  How wacky would this be?                        </div>

                            Andy &amp; Fred's comments, are dead-on, but character interaction is a problem for <i>all</i> asynchronous games. To me this doesn't seem worse than PBEM for that purpose. Tony's idea of edited conflict sounds like an interesting adjoint to that, though not without potential for abuse.<br><br>For me the biggest thing about Amber's conflict resolution is not that things are diceless, but that there is a lot of information hiding going on - you never know your <i>own</i> attributes, let alone anyone else's! I know there should be a good way to do that, I just don't know if there's an existing system for it or if I'd have to (shudder) try to code something up myself. I suck at coding.<br><br>On a slight aside, shadow-walking with the Logrus has always been iffy at best in my mind.<br><br>Off to bed. More ideas later.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Actually, it sounds like an amusing idea for a Tir-na Nog'th game.  You'd write the events, and then the "players" can embellish or change for, say, a week for a turn, and then you lock the page down.

                            Well, maybe not write the events...<br><br>Perhaps set up the situation?  I hate, as GM, to dictate such things.<br><br/>Meera, if you host, I'd like to moderate.<br/><br/>Here's what I'm thinking:<br/><br/>There wouldn't be "character creation" per se... instead, there'd be "character exploration" scenes... and then "conflict generation" scenes... probably numbering a few less than the number of players... and after that, things should start to flow organically.<br/><br/>Each player would have one character that he's responsible for... but he wouldn't "own" it in the classic sense, not completely.<br/><br/>During the "character exploration" scenes, each player in the scene would be responsible for defining one aspect of each <i>other</i> character in the scene.  Kind of like Corwin's remeniscences with Flora, each player would have his character reveal things about the other characters.  At the end of those scenes, I (as GM) could sit down and "stat up" the characters.  Or we could do it cooperatively.  Or something like that.<br/><br/>During "conflict generation" groups of characters would be thrown together in scenes where their differences are highlighted.  The requirement for each of these scenes is that by the end, the players would be required to either reveal a pre-existing conflict, or create a new one.<br/><br/>After these scenes are played through, players would be able to help set scenes based on their characters abilities and motivations as established early on.<br/><br/>I think Tir-na Nog'th is a perfect place to play this out.  I'll start jotting down some ideas of what Tir-na Nog'th is like from the point of view of the inhabitants, but here are some early ideas:<br/><br/>The pattern, and pattern initiates, are ghostly and insubstantial in Tir-na Nog'th.  They have a disruptive effect on the inhabitants, causing them to conform to whatever twists of fate they bring with them.  Inhabitants of Tir-na Nog'th often retain aspects of personality, or even power, after one of these encounters.  When Corwin goes to Tir-na Nog'th and encounters a ghostly Benedict, he's not actually encountering Benedict, but rather a local whose form and personality have been affected by the Pattern's power.  As in Rebma, inhabitants of Tir-na Nog'th cannot walk the pattern; if they do, they fade away and dissolve into mist.  Amber is seen as a hellish place, dense and earthy and crude.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I can hook you up with a Wiki at SkySeaStone.Net - what's your poison?  I've got PmWiki and DokuWiki already installed.<br/><br/>What I had been thinking was something like this:
<blockquote><br/><strong>GM</strong> <em>"The mists settle.  Corwin thrusts at the crystal chitin of the giant buglike creature.  More of its neighbors seem to be emerging tentatively from the cracks in the ghostly Pattern."</em><br/><br/>Then the next person to log in writes: <em>"Charlotte concentrates on her Logrus, seeing if being near the broken Pattern damages her."</em><br/><br/>The next makes a change and adds her character's contribution.  <em>"Corwin thrusts <strong>and connects</strong> with the crystal<strong>line</strong> chitin of the giant <strong>Insectile</strong>.  Mizuko pulls out her Trump of Benedict."</em><br/><br/>The GM adds in to Charlotte's action, until they determine the "scene" is finished, locking the page and going to the next event.<br/></blockquote>
I like your idea, too, though.  Would there be rules as too how many traits (1 negative or "challenging" and then 2 positive or "assisting") one could add to another character?                        </div>

                            I'm not very much up on the differences.  I haven't used many-- I use Twiki at work.<br/><br/>Ideally, I'd like to see a "discussion" page where OOC issues with a particular scene can be handled, and a "content" page where the actual IC play would happen, kind of the way wikipedia works.  Do either of those systems do that?<br/><br/>on the topic of traits... I don't see them being very broad.  They could be stacked up like cordwood as long as they are fairly evenly distributed.<br/><br/>"Corwin is a better swordsman than Julian."<br/>"Eric is a better swordsman than Corwin."<br/>"Eric has doubts about his ability to beat Corwin."<br/>"Julian has the best horse in Amber."<br/><br/>et multiple cetera.  in fact, I see these things coming out long after the initial scenes have been played.                        </div>

                            I think that you should consider not trying to hide any of the information as Amber says you should. The hidden information is part of what makes the game seem competitive. Why should the players not know things that their characters don't know? Unless it's somehow "unfair?" Open up the player knowledge, and I think it'll work a lot, lot better.<br/>

                            I'd probably set you up on the PmWiki, then - I'll contact you privately about that off-forum.<br><br>The other question I had was tracking posting requirements/restrictions - say I'm very enthused about the project - how often can I contribute something without overrunning players who have less accessibility to the wiki?                        </br></br></div>

                            Well, the "Don't be an ass" rule governs overall, but it seems to me that good guidelines would be:<br/><br/>1&gt; Don't edit a scene more than once a day, unless you're correcting typos.<br/>2&gt; Don't edit a scene a second time unless everyone else signed up for it has had a go since the first time.<br/><br/>As moderator my policy would be to try to keep scenes from including more than three PC's at a time.                        </div>
