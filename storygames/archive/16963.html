Perhaps even avoid words succeeded/failed when describing how tests work (a rose by any other name doesn't smell as sweet if it's all in your imagination). Mouseguard is skewed towards heroes failing often since failures generate more story (and it also encourages self-generated failure through Checks). However, if you look at actual heroic stories, heroes don't fail often; it's just that circumstances change.<br/><br/>So a Mouseguard failed Boatcrafting roll isn't "you built a crap boat and noticed it too late and it sank and you're stranded", it's "you built a strong boat, the best you could make under these circumstances; it's the only thing keeping you alive as the unexpected summer storm hit! Quick, you need to think of something before the waves flip your boat over or you get stranded". Let only self-generated failures be described as character failures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386042/#Comment_386042" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T09:30:42+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  9:30AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2012 9:31AM by J_Walton.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard is great, but not necessarily great as an intro RPG. It's less dense than Burning Wheel, sure, but still way more dense than a lot of things. The level of detail on the character sheet is also pretty intimidating.  I love that game to death, but it's not necessarily what I'd recommend, especially because it's not really meant to be run as a one-on-one game.  I've run it successfully that way, but it mostly worked because both players were pretty familiar with the game and comfortable hacking it to make it work. <br/><br/>The conflict system is built to basically require 3 or more PCs and the characters are intended to be good at some things but not most things. Having certain crucial skills and traits and stats spread around the party is part of the design. You pretty much have to have NPC allies when you run it with a single PC, and that's going to be pretty complicated for someone's first game. Also, the whole idea of failure as a dramatic thing that sets up future play is awesome once you get the hang of it, but -- as the folks above note -- it can be daunting and discouraging for beginning players.<br/><br/>So, all in all, nice idea but I'd advise against it. There are many introductory RPGs out there that are decent as solo games, but I don't think Mouse Guard is really one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386053/#Comment_386053" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T10:49:09+00:00" title="July 31, 2012 10:49AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm..

There's also Michael Wight's <i>World of Warhammer</i> if you want something that feels more like BW-lite (and it's freely available). Seems like that would work fine with 1 PC.<br/><br/>I would even consider something like the D&amp;D boardgames (<i>Castle Ravenloft</i>, etc.), which go a long ways towards teaching a lot of basic RPG ideas and concepts, and would also allow you to play collaboratively together, against the board. They're fun and exciting and let new folks get their toes wet before stepping up into a more involved experience. But if she's attracted to the storytelling as much as the action-adventure, this won't do as much of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386079/#Comment_386079" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T14:44:35+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  2:44PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Run BWG without using the Spokes (for awhile).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386125/#Comment_386125" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T04:59:16+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  4:59AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest also making your wife's choices crystal clear, and why she might want to do either one. At first, hand them to her on a platter. Most people are not used to making a game move forward, steering maybe, but usually board games have two to three choices for the player at any turn and they MUST do one of them. RPGs can be confusing because they can do anything they want. You're used to the freedom, it seems intuitive to you, but if you think way back to your first experience role playing you'll remember how limited your thinking was.<br/><br/>I just recently started RPing with my kids and I let them know what their clear strategies are. I also give them a trail of breadcrumbs. They made their first leap in their third game where the trail ended and they had to figure out where to go. By this time they were ready for it, soon they'll be driving the story but they're not there yet. They still look to me for what's next.

You won't actually get to the player's turn until you've played through some more guided sections and have an idea of how rolls work. Then in the next phase mention you can use alternate abilities to the one given if they make sense.<br/><br/>Also, I don't see why Mouseguard is a bad beginner RPG. Character creation is very logical and helps establish the world and where your mouse fits in with it, and the game itself is actually really smooth and simple when you play it. Most of the heavy lifting of rules is actually on the GM's side of the game.<br/><br/>As a Burning Wheel fan, I would say it's not actually Burning Wheel lite. It's got a lot of similar mechanics but it's very much it's own game, and has a very different feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386176/#Comment_386176" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T20:50:00+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  8:50PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MG's an excellent beginner RPG, but it's not really designed for 1-on-1 play.

Perhaps one might want to see about fixing the amount of times the world escalates.. but.. still a good time to be had!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386872/#Comment_386872" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-11T10:18:45+00:00" title="August 11, 2012 10:18AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone done Lady Blackbird 1 on 1?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386928/#Comment_386928" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-12T16:59:44+00:00" title="August 12, 2012  4:59PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I just feel like soooooo much of MG is about the teamwork.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
