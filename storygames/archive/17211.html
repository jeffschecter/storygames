He was referring at the time to secrets, but I think it can be extended to "internal" conflicts.<br/><br/>I put them in quotes because I think they only really matter/exist/have relevance when they are externalized.<br/><br/>One way to generate "internal" conflicts that are likely to externalize is to ask good leading questions, as a GM. <br/><br/>"What did the Baron do to make you hate him?" implies that there is something internal going on that is likely to spill out when the time is right. Plus, by answering the question, you put it out on the table for the players to know about, so they can be aware of it as existing in the fiction and can appreciate it, even if the character keeps it pretty close to the chest.<br/><br/>In novels, we often see internal conflict working well because the author either give us insight as to what is going on, or gives us carefully worded hints that give the reader insights into things that the characters might be missing.<br/><br/>With roleplay, it can be challenging to externalize the internal, unless the game being played has tools for doing so and those tools are being used.<br/><br/>If you're making up your own tools for adding internal conflict, I'd suggest that it's super important to make sure that those conflicts are externalized, so that they can be experienced by the participants. Otherwise, they don't exist.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know that they exist in the head of a player. And yeah, everyone's experience is somewhat subjective anyway. But my point is that we're trying to create a shared imaginary space, right? So it's best to make sure that things are shared as much as possible, rather than driving toward less sharing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390566/#Comment_390566" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T13:24:08+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  1:24PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For aspirations, my approach has been to ask something along the lines of "what great success or achievement will your character have 10 years from now?"</blockquote>Gotcha, I'll have work on implementing something like that.

I have a few ways I can accomplish that. I think it will take a couple of different approaches but I first have to figure out how to model the conflicts in words and then I can figure out if there's one unified law to it, or if it needs to be approached from a dozen different directions.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390577/#Comment_390577" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T14:00:49+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  2:00PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.
