Sadly I didn't find anything I liked that much, and my interest in a Sci-Fi game waned.<br/><br/>But recently I've gotten back into a sci-fi mood and have been renewing my search for a system.<br/><br/>I just recently came across Ashen Stars, which is a game using the Gumshoe System, now, I am unfamiliar with the system and would like to know more about it before I buy the game. So sell me on it.<br/><br/>Here's a bit of an idea on what I like in a system now... Rules-lightish, a minimum of GM paperwork, smooth fast combat, a focus on actual characters rather than just a bag of stats, skill-based, simple die mechanic<br/><br/>So is Gumshoe what I'm looking for? If you think so please feel free to say Why, and even give me a rundown of how the system works and anything interesting about it. Also, keep this on topic, if you have problems with the system please tell me, but keep it civil.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish" title="CoveredInFish"><img alt="CoveredInFish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/940/nWJ86I3UKR7RA.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish">CoveredInFish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428856/#Comment_428856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T16:22:55+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  4:22PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I quite like Ashen Stars and Gumshoe in general.<br/><br/>It is lightweight, runs smooth and the Ashen Stars universe is (to me) quite inspiring.<br/><br/>Gumshoe IS a specialized tool to tell/play investigative stories. The method it chooses works fine but its the centerpoint of the rules. IMHO the combat rules e.g. are - while being fast - a little bit simple (and I dont need especially complex combat). <br/><br/>IIRC there is no special focus on actual characters (although there are some pointers to it) and you will have a large number of stats (that can be handled easily).<br/><br/>My conclusion - it is the system I would choose if the story I wanna tell is of the investigative type. Detectives in space - cool. Play stories like Firefly or Revelation-Space-Series .. better look for something else.<br/><br/>HTH                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428857/#Comment_428857" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T16:35:24+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  4:35PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2014 4:36PM by John_Powell.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Gumshoe meets all of your criteria.

I find systems where you commit resources to improve your chance of success before the roll to be very frustrating. You can't help either over committing or under committing, and both are a waste. <br/><br/>Next time I run Gumshoe we will spend pool points <b>after</b> the rolls.<br/><br/>Other systems you might consider:<br/><a href="http://galileogames.com/bulldogs-fate/" rel="nofollow">Bulldogs!

Someone had a really powerful insight into why That Which Had Gone Before was totally f-ed up, but then proposed an alternative that just doesn't work in the real world.  GUMSHOE makes great points about the structure of investigative adventures, but the actual rules system behind it isn't robust enough to support play.  If you're in the market for a setting, buy Ashen Stars.  Because despite what I just wrote about how terrible the GUMSHOE system is, I ran a GUMSHOE game for a year and will continue to buy their products--their settings and adventures are that good.  But if you're looking for a system to use for your own setting, look somewhere else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428877/#Comment_428877" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T04:16:51+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  4:16AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Ashen Stars for the first time last week at Dreamation.  I quite enjoyed it!  I think what I liked most was that my passing out of information and clues was not tied to specific rolls of the dice.  This was particularly apparent in conversations with NPCs, because it meant the dialogue did not get interrupted.    Ashen Stars seems to be GM-prep heavy--at least for me it was--the GM has to know what clues are out there in order to pass out the information.  But almost none of the prep was wasted, because I built the prep from the list of character skills.  For example, prep consisted of deciding what information does the skill 'Forensic Accounting' provide about the victim and the murderer, etc.  The adventure became a vehicle for me to pass out the information I had prepared.  Yet I've also ran Night's Black Agents--another Gumshoe game--virtually without prep and it worked fine.  The basic difference in running the two games was that in Ashen Stars, the players used character skills to find clues.  In NBA, the players used those skills to create information.  I imagine you could run Ashen Stars the same way.  Full disclosure--I'm also biased towards Gumshoe because Pelgrane has published some of Bill, my brother's, TOC and Ashen Stars adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428889/#Comment_428889" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T09:54:07+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  9:54AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2014 9:55AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yet I've also ran Night's Black Agents--another Gumshoe game--virtually without prep and it worked fine.

I'm coming at this as someone who has basically never had any play with mystery/investigative elements that go deeper than one layer of clue-finding, and Gumshoe seems very much intended for veteran detectives.<br/><br/>Mind, it might help if I actually finish reading NBA first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01" title="Tensen01"><img alt="Tensen01" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/257/nJB7ZNBC44W33.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01">Tensen01</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428890/#Comment_428890" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T10:02:49+00:00" title="February 27, 2014 10:02AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the feedback.

And in turn, I now try to make all my clues in ToC 0-spend (that is, if you have the knowhow, you get the clue), unless I think up a particularly fragrant detail that's clearly DVD bonus material. <br/>So investigative spends are almost exclusively for when a player says "can I spend a point of Streetwise to do X"?<br/><br/>I am not overly fond of the General Abilities in GUMSHOE.

I think it helps to play GUMSHOE with a bit of an understanding of the metafiction.

It's that they're just not well developed.  D&amp;D takes effort to master, but gives something back for that mastery.  The system for general skills in GUMSHOE, by contrast, provides no benefit to gameplay.  Resource management in D&amp;D feels like you're making important choices within the game.  Resource management in GUMSHOE feels like you're doing work to compensate for problems with the game's design.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is this:  When you pick up the dice in D&amp;D, you're likely to get a feeling of anticipation.

We don't really know what we're up against so we've been careful and have developed some pretty strict tradecraft rules which have stood us in good stead. We run away more than in any game I've played, even though we're pretty badass. In Ashen Stars, we were happier to go full frontal more often. It's a different vibe.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a>, You don't have to allocate all your investigative points at the start, you can keep some back for a floating pool, and as you earn experience, this is also unallocated.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure the Stability below 0 meaning you can't use investigative skills is going to change in the next edition (which has been discussed by I've not heard anything firm on it). We now use it to mean you have to succeed a stability roll to use such skills.<br/><br/>Generally when we play GUMSHOE, the idea behind an investigative spend is that the player gets some spotlight and something exciting happens. That can mean some useful information but quite often our spends are much broader than that, for example spending Intimidate during a fight to stop the enemy hitting you for a round. Asking for spends is a tricky one, and depends a lot on who is playing. In our group almost everyone spends when they come to what seems like a sensible point to do so, much as you would ask the GM if you could make a roll in BRP. But not everyone does this so I'll sometimes ask if an interpersonal spend is going to be forthcoming. I also use a lot of 0-point spends and this are for very small amounts of information and an indication whether any more might be available or not if a spend were to be made.<br/><br/>So, for example, if the group goes into a room covered in a mess of papers, obviously some kind of personal memoire, I'll point to the person with Evidence Collection and say "It looks like there's something interesting here but it may take a while to collate it all", they are then likely to say "I'll spend and speed the process up." They might even say "Some of this paper looks a bit newer than the rest, see less dusty. I'll bet that's where will found out what the creep has been up to most recently, 1 point of Evidence Collection?".<br/><br/>There are many different ways of handling points and it's about finding the best way that works for your players. I think the information on how to play GUMSHOE needs to go beyond the "don't stop the flow" stage to more practical information about handling the game in different groups.<br/><br/>Regarding general skills, well I don't mind the GUMSHOE set-up. Dice feel like a bit of an interruption for me anyway, but I know that's not a very common feeling. Many players identify the d20 directly with their sword, and fair play to them. <br/><br/>I'm not a massive fan of large random variation so I'm happy with a d6 and I quite like the difference between the action scenes which might fail and the information ones which don't. It makes for good fiction. That said, in Fantasy GUMSHOE we've experimented with different ways of handling such things, including requiring rolls for some non-core clue spends.<br/><br/>I'm surprised often about how little players spend on rolls. I usually try to make sure, or do it another way. I blow through a ton of points in most games and take full advantage of the various refresh rules, some of which are more interesting than others. I used a variety of ways of refreshing Stability in my recent magic revival game and that seemed to work well, especially when tied into sources of Stability.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429231/#Comment_429231" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T18:27:44+00:00" title="March  7, 2014  6:27PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">@GB_Steve</a> , the problem isn't with the d6:  it's with the way that general pool spends work.  the GUMSHOE system has created a space where a character with a lot of points in a general skill rarely feels different from a character with a single point in a skill, and where players are never excited about the results of a die roll.<br/><br/>It really feels like the general skill system in esoterrorists was just a late, half baked edition to the cool stuff that was going on with general skills, and that every mechanical improvement since has been adding on to an unsuitable skeleton.
