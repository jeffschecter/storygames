The idea was for the songs to serve the same purposes that illustrations serve.  It worked on at least one person that I've heard from, and that's enough for me to call it a success.<br/><br/>I also plan to do this for GRiM, the game of operatic horror adventure (which is to say, Castlevania: the RPG).  The style is, in true Castlevania form, a smooth blend of Baroque, Roccoco, Romantic, prog, and dance forms.  I've been composing for it for a while now, using a midi sequencer on my computer.  Which turned out to be really appropriate:  the cheesy midi synth sounds really hearken back to the old 16-bit and sometimes even 8-bit days.  I'm planning to just record it straight from the midi sequencer (perhaps using a few tricks I know to get some better timbre out of the drums), because it really just adds to the vibe I'm going for.<br/><br/>At least, I think it does.  It's possible that I am too close to see any problems with it.<br/><br/>So, I'm gonna post a bunch of pieces and get some thoughts on them from you guys.  As you listen to them, here's the questions I'd like you to be thinking of answers for:<br/><br/>If you're familiar with Castlevania, does this music remind you of it?  Does it seem derivative, or does it have enough of an original flair to it?  Does the cheesy synth sound add to the atmosphere, or does it make you want to curse the sky and shake your fist at heaven?<br/><br/>Even if you're not familiar with Castlevania, what kind of moods, feelings, and images does this music invoke?  Does it seem appropriate for a game in which you storm the fortress of a malevolent, supernatural entity, doing battle with his legions of hideous minions in your relentless quest to put the master of the castle to death -- not just to save the world, but for intense, personal, and even melodramatic reasons?<br/><br/>To listen to the midis, you'll need to go to this page <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/sound/grim.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  They are composed using the synth patches of the Microsoft Wavetable Synth, which you have if you're running Windows.  Unless your PC came with a fancy soundcard or are using soundfonts of some sort, it will already be the default midi device.  It's important that you listen to these using the Microsoft Wavetable Synth, because each melody is done with a layer of instrument patches playing the same part, in order to achieve special timbres (not unlike mixing paint to get certain colors).<br/><br/>(If you're a Mac user, or you're running Linux, I don't know what to tell you)<br/><br/>By the way, bonus points to anyone who can identify the first piece used in the Medley.  Because, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is or who composed it.  In the interest of non-plagiarization, let me go ahead and say that the other two pieces used in the Medley are Bach's "Toccata &amp; fugue in D minor" and Beethoven's "Fur elise."  And while any hack could have done said Medley, it's a fun piece, so I don't mind its hackiness.<br/><br/>-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177459/#Comment_177459" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T15:21:08+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  3:21PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You have a Castlevania rpg in the works? Live and learn. Man, if you need somebody to read it, I'm there.<br/><br/>As for the music - I like it, it's reminiscent of '80s game music, such as Castlevania games. Castlevania actually didn't use to have such a strong "creepy horror" musical cliche going on that you have here in places, but I don't know if that's changed since the 8-bit days. You might want to listen to this in light of, I don't know, Addams Family or something like that - in places this sounds like some sort of children's Halloween music, at least a little bit. So more baroque gothic, less quesy creeky, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>For recording the CD, I suspect that doing the whole album in straight midi will get tiresome for the listener's ear, simply because most are not used to listening to the distinctive midi sound for long periods - not a problem if you don't intend the album for continuous play, perhaps. To counteract the effect, I suggest doing some ambient, natural sounds as a change of pace and to vary the soundscape: you could record something with lots of subtones and soft noise, like water or such. Wolf howls are an organic sound that's pretty obvious in the context. Mixing that in between these pieces, or perhaps cleverly using something like that as inventive backgrounds in places, might soften the angularity of the midi sound. Or something, might be writing out of my ass here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177463/#Comment_177463" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T16:29:30+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  4:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2008 4:30PM by Graham.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Even if you're not familiar with Castlevania, what kind of moods, feelings, and images does this music invoke? </blockquote>\nIt makes me think of a computer game, which of course it's meant to, but little beyond that. \n<blockquote>Does it seem appropriate for a game in which you storm the fortress of a malevolent, supernatural entity, doing battle with his legions of hideous minions in your relentless quest to put the master of the castle to death -- not just to save the world, but for intense, personal, and even melodramatic reasons?</blockquote>\nIt's appropriate for storming that fortress in a computer-gamey way.

I demand answers.<br/><br/>Regarding the software: if you're running Windows, and you play the midis in Media Player, it will rout them through the selected midi device (which is selected by going into the Control Panel, then to the sound &amp; something-or-other devices), which will be, by default (unless your PC had a fancy soundcard when you purchased it), the Microsoft Wavetable Synth.  Some programs (like Quicktime Player) have a built-in synth, and will render the midi file through that rather than through your computer's selected midi device.

I also posted this request on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26972.0" rel="nofollow">The Forge</a>.  All in all, the responses have caused me to realize some interesting things.  Before anyone reads on, they should keep that the following is my personal thoughts, without sugar-coating.  As such, they are judgmental, inconsiderate, and unfair.  Don't bother taking offense to any of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's my realizations:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  I am satisfied with the pieces on the level of pure <i>composition</i> to a very strong, perhaps even dangerous degree.  There is nobody around here, either on the Forge or Story Games, whose musical opinion I respect enough for it to prompt me to re-compose even the slightest fragment of the music.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Given that I am entirely satisfied with the composition, the only thing that's up in the air are the matters of production and presentation.  I also realized (or, more aptly, <i>remembered</i>) that, in my view, most peoples' standards of presentation in music are stupid, and that most people merely <i>hear</i> music rather than listen to it, which renders their opinion (as far as I'm concerned) useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I play way more Castlevania than anybody else.  This realization has been prompted by several people telling me that "such-and-such was not very Castlevania," when it seems patently clear to me that it <i>is</i>.  I have <i>Castlevania</i>, <i>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</i>, &amp; <i>Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</i> on NES, <i>Super Castlevania IV</i> and <i>Castlevania: Dracula X</i> on SNES, <i>Castlevania: Bloodlines</i> on Sega Genesis, and <i>Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</i> and <i>Castlevania: Curse of Darkness</i> on PS2.  I play at least one of them almost daily (it's one of my favorite ways to decompress after work).  So, I'm dangerously confident that I know what I'm talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  And this is the big one.  Given the (clearly) low value I place on the opinions of [everyone who isn't me] regarding this issue, why did I <i>ask</i> for said opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, I just wanted to say, "HEY!  EVERYONE!  LOOK AT MEEEE!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a thing to keep in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178473/#Comment_178473" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T04:17:55+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  4:17AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I do it all the time.
