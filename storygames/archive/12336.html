I agree with that, but I've found it hard to point to anything online that properly promotes or explains the events for new folks.  I'm interested in talking about changing that dynamic, and possibly building the brand of these events a bit.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely clear on the history and ownership (such as it is) of IGE and GOD. I know the events have been going on since 2006 or so, and have happened at Gen Con and other cons.  I know that Kat and Michael have taken a strong lead in both, and host the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ige" rel="nofollow">IGE website on Livejournal</a>. The <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/GoD/" rel="nofollow">GOD site</a> is being generously hosted by Tony,  and both events are being organized this year by Scott.  Clearly the intention is that this is a grassroots effort, and lots of other folks have been vocal advocates.  It's even a hit <a href="http://igod.wikidot.com/contact" rel="nofollow">in Australia</a>!<br/><br/>So what else can/should we do?  I'm a web developer, so my first inclination is to put up a site with a stronger presence (its own domain, some "about" content, an archive of previous events, etc.).  Would it be useful to put up an indiegamesexplosion.com domain, backed by Wordpress or something similar, so that we could distribute content management?  Are these events worth promoting and building into a more substantial brand?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276772/#Comment_276772" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T08:39:27+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  8:39AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IGE is usually a separate thing from Games on Demand. Still, domains are cheap and we could grab both and point them to one site. A Wordpress site is easy to set up and would handle our needs pretty nicely.<br/><br/>I am happy to help write up the content for the site.<br/><br/>I think the events are awesome and are definitely worth promoting. I would package them as "this is something that you can do at your own local convention, and here's how." Not "this is something we do at these cons," though that should be part of the site.<br/><br/>If there's a wiki component, it's easy for folks all over the world to add mentions of their own events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276782/#Comment_276782" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T09:44:14+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  9:44AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I assumed that GOD was a part of IGE just because that's the way it looks on the Gen Con schedule.

My low-end goal is really just to score a more convenient location near the convention hall and maybe have the freedom to put up a few signs.  Even if we're only pulling in our own SG tribe, it would be nice if we could easily tell them where to go.<br/><br/> Also, as a publisher, I think that creating space for people to play our games is critical to seeing sales at the booths.
