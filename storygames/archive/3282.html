Other Jason suggested the Big Con as a variant and I sure like the sound of that.  I love confidence games.  I want to write a game based on the Big Con.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Con-Story-Confidence-Man/dp/0385495382" rel="nofollow">Maurer's book</a> is one of my favorites ever.  Let's talk about how to game con games.<br/><br/>It's problematic.  The conflicts are incremental and very subtle.  Failure is often catastrophic.  Any thoughts on how to game this?  If you were charged with turning <i>The Sting</i> into a game, where would you start?  If you were porting it into your D&amp;D game, where would you start?  If you were basing a short campaign around the premise, what rules set would you run to?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74461/#Comment_74461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T11:10:24+00:00" title="June  8, 2007 11:10AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And how would you prevent it from becoming <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120890/" rel="nofollow">"Wild Things"</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

So, as the conmen work through the con their successes and failures impact the confidence score, which can then be narrated appropriately.<br/><br/>And, I would say, failure only <i>seems</i> like it would be catastrophic.

And from there, all myths everywhere about The Trickster).<br/>\n- Episodes of Lost that spotlight Sawyer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what's the pleasure in a Con story?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Asserting mental superiority over the mark.<br/>\n- The basic thrill of high-stakes improv: Con man has to manage unexpected factors and keep the mark in the world of the con.<br/>\n- Pathos! The con man starts to see the mark as a human being, and struggles with the knowledge that finishing the con will ruin the mark.<br/>\n- Status changes: (more improv terms!) Con man is a low status figure who humiliates high status figures and lowers their status. But then the mark turns it around and reveals that he has been conning the con man the whole time! But then the con man reveals that he knew the entire time and...<br/>\n<br/>\nGaming applications<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could use Prime Time Adventures, or maybe any storytelling game, to tell a Con story where you wanted to focus on Pathos, status changes, and character relationships built up around the Con. Everybody at the table probably understands all aspects of the Con, but they'll play their characters appropriately because the Con is really just there so that people have something to do while we watch their relationships change. This is a lot like the Procedural Mysteries JDCorley talks about in the great big Mystery Game thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you play a competitive story game about Cons where the players are actively trying to Con each other while avoiding being Conned? Yeah, probably. You'd want some sort of resolution system to handle what is essentially mental/social combat. Maybe there's an alternate setting for Contenders here?

Even in Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, things only get messed up when people get off track. It's really all about the distractions. With the exception of the sub-genre of the bumbling con comedy, the con men are the "best" or at least very competent, and don't mess up the con by fumbling. They mess up by making the wrong decision somewhere along the way. Like loyalty issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the "sub-game" of finding marks... if this is to emulate the movies, they all start with the mark chosen already. The movie is about the preparation and execution. How fun is playing out the dull job of finding the right person?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua hits on something imporant, too, however. All of these movies, and I mean all of them, have the element that we as audience do not know how the con is going to go down as it executes. One of the bits of suspense is that, though the characters know what they're about, we don't, and we watch waiting to see what the brilliant plan was that they had as it executes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not normally one for secret info, but if ever there was a case for it, here's one. So... how do you prevent the players from knowing how the con works, if their characters know?<br/>\n<br/>\nI propose a bit of post-modern RPG play. The players use a system that empowers them to create elements. NPC members of the con brought in for some small part of the job, for instance. Or strange bits of equipment. Disguises. Whatever. They don't have to explain what these elements are for, however, what the purpose for them is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the preparation phase has two purposes. First, the players establish all of these elements so we wonder, "How are they going to pull this off?" Second, at the same time that they introduce these things, the prep-scenes are really all about introducing potential distractions for each PC. The person who delivers the disguise is the old girlfriend of one PC, and another player establishes that he's had a problematic relationship with her before, and refuses to work with her. That sort of thing. All the while, the cocky cool leader believes that he has everything under control, and nothing can go wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen in the second phase, the execution, play is about linking together the elements from the prep to "discover" how the con works. The system then forces players into more and more convoluted designs, by rejecting easy answers (the player who has his idea rejected, has to come up with a plausible reason why this answer is not possible). So as people have to discard the easy ideas, the plot grows more and more complex. As this happens, the distractions show up in spades, and try to draw off the characters in directions that mess up the plan as it's evolving. The getaway car driver, who hasn't told the rest of the group that he has an APB out for him, sees the cops headed his way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that all of these movies are only about the con in that it's fun to see it evolve. Otherwise it's about the character's issues, and how these threaten to derail the brilliant plan, and what, in the end, is more important to the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample of player failure to set up an easy explanation:<br/>\nOverdub narration: "See, normally at this point we would just have clubbed the guy at the back door, and left him to be found by the marks after it was all over. But it turned out that this was no normal doorman, but Otto "Bruiser" Steadman. Marco had once hit him in the head with a lead pipe from behind without him knowing it was coming, and it only made him angry. No, we were going to need a little something more for Bruiser." Cue scene of Bruiser walking out from the door to pick up a hundred dollar bill, looking up, being hit by a '72 Buick Centurion convertible, flipping unconscious into the back seat, and then being driven off.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

What I'm talking about avoiding is "wandering monster" style mark choice. The marks in question are all selected by the author, at least, for the drama that they provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody is going to have to provide the mark in play, that's sure. What I'm advocating is some sort of mark creation process whereby the "discovered" mark (whether discovered in media res, or in the early scenes), is one that the players are interested in conning. It should be a deliberate process that the players care about, much like how the players have to create the Master in the game My Life With Master.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I, at least, would not be interested in is like the old Theives World game where you have a city laid out, and you go through the NPCs that exist in that city, trying to find somebody to rip off who seems likely. I'd much rather that the system allow the players to invent this character as they need the character to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this is, surprise, the very narrativism take on this. If one is looking for the player challenge to do the planning and such, and pull off a con, that's an entirely different sort of game than what I'm envisioning personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut where we're completely agreed is that the element of interaction with the mark has to be carefully built up. I'm seeing that as part of the prep phase, but that's semantic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

And other players can interject things in a Baron Munchausen-esque way, or can add in further complications on their own turn.  So the players themselves aren't sure that the big plan is and who may be setting up a double-cross, but these things emerge nicely as all the pieces come together.  In the couple of sessions I played there was a lot of players setting up obstacles/complications that other folks had to deal with.<br><br>Then in the second phase of the game everybody is bidding points they earned in the first phase to see who gets the "last word". This is where the potential to double cross the group and walk away with the briefcase full of cash comes in. The whole game walks the line between cooperative and competitive nicely, depending on what your group wants to do. <br><br><a href="http://head58.livejournal.com/233435.html" rel="nofollow">Here's another Actual Play: The Namibian Job</a>.

John (editswithlonghair) is too modest to say it, and too much of a hermit to give his ingenious game all the internet promotion it so richly deserves, but <i>Caper</i> is almost exactly what Mike just described above. Group-created mark, plan created on the fly, preparation done retroactively using resource management, no danger of whiffing but plenty danger of double-cross from your fellows. And highly recommended. It's cool that everyone's imaginations are whirring, but really, the game you are all talking about has pretty much been written. Please do check it out.<br><br>To spare this from just being a "me three!" post, I just saw the latest <i>Ocean's</i>... movie, and was struck by how the first half of the movie, ostensibly the part where our heroes prepare for a job, is actually just a series of scenes in which people describe how hard the job is going to be. I think you could model this in a heist game (Caper or whatever else you cook up) where you have a series of early scenes establishing <i>conditions</i> ("The Bellagio vault? Nothing short of a nuclear warhead could crack that door open..." "And it would take all the NSA's supercomputers seventy years to crack that security system..." "The troll guarding the treasure hoard is seventeen feet tall and never sleeps...") that the later improvised heist in action scenes would then have to take into account.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83266/#Comment_83266" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T12:12:03+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 12:12PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob - you could put the conditions on index cards and throw them into the middle of the table.
