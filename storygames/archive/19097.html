If there already is a cyberpunk game you like, tell us why it works for you. I've probably talked about this stuff before, but screw it, I still want to yak about my favorite flavor of sci-fi.<br/><br/>It seems there are roughly two types of cyberpunk games on the market: one type is about tactical cyber-dungeons (the trad games), the other type about noirish character relationships (Remember Tomorrow, Technoir). The tactical type appeals to me in its first-person immersionism and slow tempo: you are actually there in the graffiti-covered tube station, holding that smartlinked MGX laser-spammer in your chromed hand. But then we'll get to the boring stuff: where are you actually standing, by the trashcan or next to the rails? Is your smartlink +1 or +2? What is your rate of fire? <br/><br/>The noirish type, especially Remember Tomorrow, appeals to me in its lightness and freedom, but is more about who's screwing who than sights and sounds, time and place. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426302/#Comment_426302" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T09:04:56+00:00" title="December 27, 2013  9:04AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm intrigiued.

So basically the same as the literary genre.<br/><br/>From my viewpoint the urban warfare stuff and the unique snowflake superpowers that cyberpunk games are filled with are ultimately irrelevant noise caused by the cultural context of traditional roleplaying; when all you can do is adventure games, your cyberpunk game is an adventure game as well. It's the same treatment rpgs give to all literary genres, they're reduced to little more than sets of interchangeable props.<br/><br/>Although there is no specific game that focuses on this thing I want, in practice this isn't much of a hurdle for me; we played a cyberpunk campaign with the <i>Solar System</i> last year, for example, and it worked just fine in exploring this type of fiction. I am not currently sufficiently obsessed to push for a genre-specific game, a suitable generic system does the job just fine.<br/><br/>Also, this last summer we played a lengthy playtest campaign of Tuomas Kortelainen's new game "Subsection M3", which is basically Bladerunner without the trademark; I found it very satisfying as a cyberpunk game because of how the game is structured to take GM-provided future shock insanity and turn it into an organic experience of a futuristic megalopolis. We had a magnificent time as I ripped off one Philip K. Dick novel after another for content. It's the closest that a rpg has ever gotten to feeling like Transmetropolitan comics, which is already a pretty remarkable thing. Even there, though, the magic is in the players (the GM particularly) more than in the game: I'm just a cyberpunk person, so give me an opportunity to barf forth about postmodern feudal wage-slavery, and off we go. Not that Subsection isn't an excellent game - I fully expect it to be the greatest Finnish rpg ever, should Tuomas get off his ass and publish already.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426305/#Comment_426305" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T09:33:21+00:00" title="December 27, 2013  9:33AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2013 9:35AM by Upstart.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm intrigiued.

It's the ultimate urban survivor fantasy, where you have to nagivate in different circles of society to earn your living. On the whole, I don't think the aesthetic appeal of genres in general is necessarily tied to any obvious elements, people enjoy the rich and varied tradition in them. In that sense, cyberpunk's age only adds to its appeal: now there's nostalgy for 80s and 90s cyberpunk.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Cyberpunk 2020 is its own beast, even if it has been influential. I don't feel it is representative of the genre in a way Blade Runner and Neuromancer are: it's pretty much a cybered-up D&amp;D with some broader cultural elements that don't quite seem to gel in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426310/#Comment_426310" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T11:27:58+00:00" title="December 27, 2013 11:27AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/261959" rel="nofollow"> this ole thread</a>:<br/><br/><i>"I wanted a game about the ambulance teams, fuck everything else.

I'm cool with the adventure game but only without the 90s obsession of crap, and with more storygamey cleverness.

That being said, the enemies are definitely not without teeth and there's enough detail given on them and their plans that you can really get into the gritty tactical stuff if that's what you like, without getting to the point where you need grids and minis to keep track of it all.<br/><br/>The plot as written is a one-and-done, but without any singificant additions to what was in the GM PDF, one group I ran it for got 50 hours of play out of it and will be continuing in a sequel. I've also rather inelegantly condensed it down to a 3 hour oneshot, which might have gone better if I hadn't expected it to be a 4 hour timeslot. One thing to flag though, the game does require a fair bit of GM prep which is proportionate to a longer game but probably out of whack if you're just looking for a 4 hour convention game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426357/#Comment_426357" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-29T12:24:38+00:00" title="December 29, 2013 12:24PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love literary cyberpunk.

The settings are close enough to classic adventure cyberpunk and the rules seem to be ok, there are just far too many of them.<br/><br/>Also, I read a bit of this old Cyberpunk 2020 GM bible Listen Up You Primitive Screwheads. The writers have beautiful visions about different cyberpunk campaigns, and they criticize very sharply the amoral killers armed to teeth -style of playing that apparently dominated 2020 campaigns of the time. However, they don't seem to draw the conclusion that the system itself in its focus on combat, tech and increasing challenge level naturally pushed the game to that direction. Young male players were probably also a big factor, but still. It's easy to see in hindsight that these writers were very ambitious with their gaming and hungry for story stuff that just wasn't supported by the game very well.<br/><br/>Direct quotes: "Romance is important in Cinema Verite (sic) only as it relates to a story. Romance here is not as much a necessity as a luxury. We're not talking about idealistic romance either, this is reality."<br/><br/>"A single light bulb hanging on bare wire, over a desk that has grooves for the tired detective's shoes. The single chair screams like a lost child, and he waits."<br/><br/>"These campaigns resolve their conflicts in other ways, with betrayal, humiliation, battles of will and complex schemes taking the place of headshots and hand grenades."\n<blockquote>My ideal cyberpunk game would be about existential uncertainty in a world riven of the comforting lies of modernity. So basically the same as the literary genre.<br/><br/>From my viewpoint the urban warfare stuff and the unique snowflake superpowers that cyberpunk games are filled with are ultimately irrelevant noise caused by the cultural context of traditional roleplaying; when all you can do is adventure games, your cyberpunk game is an adventure game as well. It's the same treatment rpgs give to all literary genres, they're reduced to little more than sets of interchangeable props.</blockquote>\nI guess I'm shallow, but I'm actually fine with the adventure game concept. I mean, the dirty urban tech-adventure thing is what got me interested in the genre originally, Neuromancer was practically a thriller with out-there elements. I'm fine with deeper readings, but I still want my adventure stuff.<br/><br/>I don't need the detailed urban warfare or other bookkeeping-intensive trad trappings, though.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426606/#Comment_426606" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T14:49:35+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  2:49PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not about shallow or deep at all - and I'm merely countering on this point because this seems to be a sad yet wide-spread impression, that thematic drama games are somehow "deeper" than adventure games. Utterly untrue, at least in the sense I'd understand these adjectives.<br/><br/>I do admit that I tend towards "deep" games (it's a natural consequence of being heavy into this hobby), but the reason for why I'd right now opt for a thematic Cyberpunk game over a tactical adventure game isn't that the former is necessarily deeper; rather, it's because I cannot currently imagine how an interesting and deep adventure game in the futuristic urban milieu would go. I can imagine this for other settings; for example, I've been rocking the D&amp;D "start poor and work your way into high nobility" setting lately, and it suits well for adventure play.<br/><br/>I guess the key issue for me is ultimately that I don't find the sociology of urban warfare in the cyberpunk setting entirely convincing when combined with D&amp;D-like snowflake adventurer troupes. It's just too tidy and pat in e.g. Shadowrun that it just so happens that all things that are worthwhile to do in the city have apparently for some reason been subcontracted to utterly unreliable, inconsistently trained crews of PC-like fuckwits; it's a setting where for some unexplained reason the central tenets of modernity no longer hold, and the day is <i>not</i> won by discipline, bureaucracy, consistently replaceable professionals, and indifferent corporate morality. (I understand that Shadowrun is <i>supposed</i> to be a genre-mixing exercise, so this isn't so much a criticism of its approach as an example of how insipid this stuff is when you take away the romantic fantasy context - other cyberpunk games don't have this excuse.) This lack of credibility makes it difficult for me to take the adventure cyberpunk entirely seriously, it starts looking like it's just a superhero fantasy with quirky color. This is what I meant when I said that adventure cyberpunk tends to treat the entire genre as little except a bunch of props; the actual activity could be exactly the same in any other setting, nothing would change. Basically, this sort of game wants to be D&amp;D, and at least in the case of Cyberpunk 2020 this is pretty clearly due to lack of imagination; they're doing D&amp;D in there because they don't dare or can't imagine how to set up the game otherwise.<br/><br/>I suppose that I could see a worthwhile cyberpunk (or urban dystopian scifi, to be less specific) adventure game if one were to build it from the ground up, without reference to the traditional structure of adventuring parties, niche specialization, GM-provided missions, and all that other jazz. For example, something like <i>Mobsters</i> would retain the essential creative agenda while breaking out of the adventuring party sociology sufficiently to help me retain my suspension of disbelief. It'd be easy to step out of the "adventure game" box altogether by attempting something like this, of course.<br/><br/>All this reminds me of a cyberpunk game well worthy of name-dropping in this conversation: <i>MSG</i> is one of the best cyberpunk roleplaying games that I've ever seen, on par with e.g. Remember Tomorrow. Unfortunately difficult to get your hands on it, though. It's technically an adventure game in the sense that there is a party and missions, but it dodges the happy-go-lucky street warrior troupe meme by having all the PCs be suits in the service of a megacorp, which does a lot to ground the adventuring socially.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426608/#Comment_426608" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T15:27:04+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  3:27PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I guess the key issue for me is ultimately that I don't find the sociology of urban warfare in the cyberpunk setting entirely convincing when combined with D&amp;D-like snowflake adventurer troupes.

For me the impressive part of cyberpunk has always been the <i>punk</i> (although there was a time when the cyber thing was also revelatory, a long time ago as it was), meaning the social consciousness. Admittedly it makes just as much sense to read the entire thing from the viewpoint of "survivalist carneval", which seems like it's behind the most common rpg treatment of the genre. I remember vividly how Cyberpunk 2020, for example, contorts itself carefully setting-wise to provide justifications for this conveniently lawless survival playground in Night City. It's a justification for gunplay and adventure to run wild, far beyond the confines of civilized behavior. I think it's totally fair to say that this, too, is cyberpunk.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426611/#Comment_426611" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T17:12:25+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  5:12PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm getting ready to start a cyberpunk2020 Campaign for 2014.  I think cyberpunk should have something to do with what it means to be human and how technology is changing that. I also like to include a little hard boiled detective noir.   Relationships should be important, because that is part of what makes us human. I prefer my cyberpunk to be just a few years into the future or transhumance like eclipse phase.  My campaign tend to include a health dose of action as that is what my player enjoy.<br/><br/>Here was my initial setting idea that I gave my players:<br/>The game will have slightly advanced tech level, something along the lines of "Total Recall", "Minority Report" or "When Gravity Falls".  American has become controlled by Corporations, and has huge difference between rich and poor maybe as in "Gattaca" or "In Time". Europe has become an Islamic Caliph a setting like in "When Gravity Falls".  There will be no full cyborg conversions. The world will have some simple cybernetics limb or eye replacements.  "Total recall" like memory modification, Skill and Personality Mod chips will be available. Memory play back and recording devices like in "Strange Days" or "BrainStorm" will be a common form of entertainment. There will be drugs that can effects your performance, memory, or personality like in "Limitless" or "A Scanner Darkly".  Some of the themes will have to do with memory and identity.  <br/><br/>We will be pushing a few years into the future, and take the cool things scientist and engineers are working on make them real production. Continue the political and economic slide making things dirtier and more divide among rich and poor.  These elements and more are in my thoughts: high-speed tube transport, phones and computers in your body, Online digital presence (how all legitimate money is now handled), holograms disguises, full body scanner, memory modification, performance drugs, gene doping, improved medical tech, 3D printing manufacturing, fletch guns, Small nano blades (no swords), functioning cyber limbs (but not better than well trained athlete), Cybernetic eye and ear enhancement, Heads up displays, self driving cars, elevated highways, memory recording and playback, slums like those in Munbui and Brazil. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426614/#Comment_426614" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T18:09:33+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  6:09PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2014 6:09PM by Upstart.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The majority of <i>Neuromancer</i> deals with the social logistics of adventure getting to occur in the first place, doesn't it?

I think this snippet from a goodreads review sums it up:\n<blockquote>"It's got a hard, tough edge, depicting gritty street life with plenty of action and violence. And that's the main disconnect for me. I've never liked action-oriented stories. I've read many a compelling narrative ruined by the seemingly obligatory big action scene in the final act. Yawn. I find reading descriptions of fights the absolute opposite of exciting. To me, it's boring. And that's the problem here. Too much action.<br/><br/>(To be clear, it's not that I'm squeamish, nor is the violence here extreme or gory.)<br/><br/>That's not to say it's brainless. To the contrary, there are some interesting ideas here. That's the "cyber" part, which looks at the interconnectedness of our modern systems and imagines how they might progress and what might go wrong. Considering it was published in 1980, before most folks knew anything about the internet, it's prescient stuff.

Dick adaptations (Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Terminator, A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Total Recall, etc.)<br/>* The Matrix and sequels<br/>* Equilibrium<br/>* Aeon Flux<br/><br/><br/>I personally love the following themes/tropes:<br/><br/>* mind as software<br/>* evil corporations replacing government<br/>* ubiquitous interconnected meganetworks<br/>* blurring of religion with technology, marketing<br/>* bricolage / postmodernism / "the street has its own uses for things"<br/><br/>The question is, how much of that is color and how much should a game design systematize? I can play a game of <i>Misspent Youth</i> and touch on all of those themes I listed, if I'm diligent about it. There's just no mechanical support for any of it. If I play CP2020 instead, I get some mechanical support for networks, and a tease of mind-as-software. The rest is left to color. If I play Shadowrun, with its piles of splatbooks, those offer mechanical support (or at least setting grist) for tons of stuff.<br/><br/>If I want a real "mind as software" game, though, so I can play <i>Altered Carbon</i> with my friends, I'm gonna have to write it. It'll have to address how a person adapts his mind to a new body, backups, time dilation in virtual realities, skills to detect when you're in virtual and not the real world, and so on.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426851/#Comment_426851" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T10:32:28+00:00" title="January  8, 2014 10:32AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2014 10:33AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want a cyberpunk game that is about urban survival/rebellion -- carving out alternate communities/social groups in the scaffolding of dominant corporate mega-culture.

Sitting in a virtual tavern waiting for a corporate avatar to offer your 'crew' a 'job' feels like such a waste of the genre, honestly.<br/><br/>There's this thing in noir where the aloof protagonist gets mixed up in other people's troubles -- where they might get invested, against their better sense, but ultimately they stand apart (and above) and pass moral judgement and then it's over and they return to their passive existence. That has never seemed like a very good match with cyberpunk to me, or at least not cyberpunk roleplaying; I'd much rather see those troubles from the inside, from the point of view of the people who are having them, and who are making them for other people and themselves because there's nowhere for them to fit.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426853/#Comment_426853" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T10:43:05+00:00" title="January  8, 2014 10:43AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Daniel!

CP2020 brings a sort of hierarchy of evil, with Mega-Corps at the top. Sure, there is government, gangs, military, mad scientist, organized crime, anarchists. But none of them hold a candle to the mega-corps.<br/>  So, it creates a sort of pointless existence for average citizens. There is no way to get out from under the oppression, so why bother? Then there are the punks, they are rebelling against the norm. And that's a good thing.<br/>  To me, cyberpunk is defined by "doing the wrong thing for the right reasons." For instance, some kind of ocean's 11 heist on a mega-corp. Its breaking many laws and its a cyberpunk setting, so someone will get hurt. But, it is for a noble cause (hopefully).<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow is the best game to come out lately, but I am still not satisfied.

The character mechanics let players win losing conflicts by "selling out" traits to their sucky, sell-out, adult versions. You sell out "cool" and become "trendy," for example. <br/><br/>The group creates the setting and characters collaboratively, then players pick actual characters to play and stat them up. It would be a simple matter to create a street gang. You could set up all the "noirish tropes, the isolation, cynicism, and bluesy feeling while not forgetting about the futuristic, dystopic , and punkish color" that your heart desires. The system has prompts to help create these things and it works very well in practice.<br/><br/>The GM structure is set mechanically and it provides a sort of narrative arc and common story structure with rising tension and denouement and such. The GM never rolls dice. You can play through a fairly epic story in 4-6 hours, if you're shooting for a one-shot, or stretch it out for a more episodic thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426945/#Comment_426945" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T07:03:10+00:00" title="January 10, 2014  7:03AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked Verge, but the music terminology threw me off.

I can't say anything much about its system, but the world-building it did for the sort of micro-cultures adopted by those who have opted out - willingly or otherwise - from orthodox society is absolutely fantastic.  There are 51 gangs in the city, each articulated as a sort of "urban tribe" for what of a better description, each using or not using technology as they feel fits their way of staying alive and getting on.

Can you blame them? Action sells games. Action can sell stories, too, but not every story needs action. So why not a game (not for market) that focuses on the rest of life?

Even using only part of the setting, creating enough stuff to play it and keep the challenges interesting requires a knoledgement of the crunch/fluff/setting and source material I don't feel able to attain quickly right now. I know my group of players will like to play with all the options available so, honestly, I wouldn't be able to offer them that as it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427349/#Comment_427349" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T15:39:00+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  3:39PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlUtYO2wL9E" rel="nofollow">this</a> I'd kind of like to see a faithful Blade Runner RPG.

Given that Cyberpunk as a literary genre is nearly thirty years old and that some of the movie versions of it (Johnnie Mnemonic comes to mind) are hillariously wrong, what is the modern appeal of this?<br/><br/>When I first played Cyberpunk, twenty years or so ago, <b>the players seemed to be getting into the angst of a dystopian world</b>. The trouble was that all they horrible future stuff didn't hold a candle to what was going on in real life back then. I worked in mental health back then and heard a saw real meanness. I like the idea of tech but can't make myself believe the dystopian part. So I know the genre isn't for me. Heck! My party chucked me out of the helicopter for being too inhuman and I didn't have any tech gear at all - I was just corporate, real corporate.<br/><br/>Shadowrun remains a very popular game so I know something is going on here. As an outsider who doesn't get it, what is the aesthetic appear. Is it similar to the Apocalypse World setting appeal?<br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/><br/> </blockquote>\nDone in one, due to the bolded part.<br/><br/>One of the most important things to be aware of (in any aspect of anything really) is the fundamental importance of connotation/denotation. People will toss about 'cyberpunk' based on one or the other, and then get boggled when the subsequent discussion fails to gatekeep this vital difference.<br/><br/>Are we talking about 'strict' cyberpunk, and if so by what definition? Or are we talking about amorphous connotations of cyberpunk?<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>By the definitions available 'cyberpunk' may, or may not, include inherent dystopia. Most seem to believe it does but many feel that any radical social change, not merely towards a subjective negative, is enough to qualify. Can we therefore imagine a utopian, instead of dystopian cyberpunk? What's more, is this change required globally, or only from a subjective biased viewpoint? If middle-class Americans read a story about an impoverished Indian as an outcast in his future society, it may <i>feel</i> dystopian to them, whereas someone currently living in such a state may see it as continuation of the status quo. Under which views does it qualify as 'dystopian' and therefore cyberpunk?<br/><br/>Many appear to equate cyberpunk specifically with computers, hacking, AI, etc, while others expand it to a broader spectrum of science fiction technology. Likewise it frequently utilizes film-noir, or detective fiction stylizations, but is this an essential element?<br/><br/>We get to the point where we have to talk about branches, offshoots, trunks, and umbrellas to have a meaningful discussion. Most don't do this, and so you end up with a situation where any story set in the near future that includes some not yet invented technology in the hands of a poor person or outcast is lumped into 'cyberpunk'. These words (dystopia and cyberpunk) end up as technically descriptive as the Doctor explaining temporal science as 'wibbly-wobbley, timey-wimey...stuff'. There may, or may not, be anything wrong with this, depending on one's warrants and views. <br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>To address your parting question, it depends. For some it's a tradition thing, or an initial exposure thing. Name another game widely available in 1989 which covered as much (and arguable as well) as Shadowrun did? It was roleplaying that wasn't D&amp;D (or even a d20 game). For those of us who were in on the cutting edge, there's a lot of memory and comfort there. <br/><br/>For others it's an 'other side of the tracks' immersion. Your average middle class, white male American (the historic target of these products) doesn't experience poverty-driven criminal intent, or racially motivated disenfranchisement. For them, this is as much cultural exposure as one could find in a social inequality integrated studies course in college. <br/><br/>There are also very real elements of social awareness and engineering to be looked at. As you point out, there is violence and negative elements in our current situation...many would say true evil. There are ineffective, inefficient, inequitable systems that seem to continue unchanged for centuries. Many of us are subtly aware of these aspects, even when we don't consciously focus on them. Games like these may provide a tunnel into the places of our hearts and minds where we dare not look. They provide a means of pseudo-agency. We get to feel justified for disliking the government, or corporations, and take action against them without having to give up our flat-screens, atms or face jail time for doing so.<br/><br/>Then there's the idea of dark-side emergence. Would you kill a man for money? Now, have you ever wished maybe you would/could do such a thing, or just wondered about those who can/do? There is attraction to exploration of fetish and anti-social or immoral behavior. This is why we can play KOTOR on the dark side as well as the light.<br/><br/>I think some combination of the above is likely the bulk of the answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19097/what-kind-of-cyberpunk-game-would-you-like-to-play" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19097/what-kind-of-cyberpunk-game-would-you-like-to-play" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19097/what-kind-of-cyberpunk-game-would-you-like-to-play/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19097%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19097%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
