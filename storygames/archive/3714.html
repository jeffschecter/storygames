We stretched it to 1.5 hours too, although that includes food getting, so it's really 1 hour of play.  But so far, it's just been character making and 1 hour was enough time to get through the first pass of the full method (character back stories and picking aspects).  Skills and stunts remain, although I think that will take less than an hour, I don't think it will be low enough to actually start.<br/><br/>It's partially an experiement though, since none of us have ever played (and one is a RPG newbie).  I'm hoping to end up with a lot of serial style cliff hangers resulting from the "frequent" session breaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83396/#Comment_83396" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T22:50:17+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:50PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Judd,<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote The Zombie Plan specifically to play during lunch hours.

"Your dad, I think... wants you to take him with you on the Beast Hunt."  etc.<br/><br/>But then, somewhere after those two encounters, I got into the flow and the narration got much smoother.  I was stymied a couple times on narration, but my attention was fully on the game and I was able to get un-stymied without too much stress.<br/><br/>So I think there's a couple things to getting spun up: first, getting my attention fully on the game so I'm not thinking about work, lunch, the security guard who's eyeing us -- and then also getting into the state of creative flow where I can generate raw ideas and shape them into useful narration.<br/><br/>This might be useful: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_</a>(psychology)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83537/#Comment_83537" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T15:50:11+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  3:50PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2007 3:51PM by rafial.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...the security guard who's eyeing us...</blockquote>\nDang, my ploy failed.

It would be great to leave it on a cliffhanger each time. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97628/#Comment_97628" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T15:55:11+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  3:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, since this has been bumped, I might as well report.<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century has been going great.  Although, we fully need the hour, and in three sessions (plus nearly two full lunch hours to make characters) we've gone over the hour mark by up to 15 minutes or so.  We've also taken into bringing in lunch or grabbing something from the kitchen (or the option of getting it before hand) instead of going out as a group to pick up food - just too much time for some of us.<br/><br/>Anyway, the big focus so far has been action packed: fight/rescue and two chases, each element taking up most of the session.  The fight had to be cut a little short, so we didn't get to wrap it up until the second session.  It was a little odd in the second session to pick up the momentum, but since the bad guys were more or less clearly defeated, it was a mop up anyway.  The chases worked beautifully.  The first one I used the multiple chase rules, and picked my chase budget (which, for those not familiar, is how many points I, as the GM, have to spend on adding additional chasers to cause problems), and never having used these rules before, I picked 10 hoping that was right, and it was perfect.  The chase ended at a perfect spot for a cliff hanger.  Having that time limit really helps keep things on track, and wrapping things up instead of bogging it down.<br/><br/>One blessing, and a little bit of a curse, is that the hour chops up these events really nicely, and so far I've been doing a cliffhanger after each one.  And mostly, that's been great.  Although, the last session was a bit hasty based on one potential idea I had, and I went with it, but I'm not sure if I should have, so I'll see if I can get myself out of a pickle.<br/><br/>I feel it should be noted, this was my first time running SotC too.  The rules were easy enough, and play quick enough, that even the first session was pretty snappy, and I never felt, though the fight wasn't as short as I hoped, that fumbling over the rules was a problem.  Part was, especially all four of us never having played it before, but most of it was me not knowing how much could be accomplished in an hour.<br/><br/>Oh, and the other great advantage, is when things go a little off track and I have to wing it, I've got a free week-long break every hour to introduce new twists and plot elements to follow up from whatever unexpected event.<br/><br/>BTW, the cliff hangers were: A burning building collapsing with one player inside; the bad guys with the stolen Mint plates getting onto a boat after the car chase (the player with the car had a modification that it can turn into a boat, but only he knew this until the next session); and now, after running down the bad guys boat and finally catching them, "something" massive is rising up from the depths in San Francisco Bay, right underneath them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
