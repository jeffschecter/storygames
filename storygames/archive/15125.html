Nobilis is close, as is Magical Burst, so I am going to be throwing both of those at a wall and seeing what sticks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I want to run a game about growing up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut its about growing up into something thats not really human.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a game of Magical Girls as Trans-humanists, and as desperate guards of humanity, or its worse nightmares.<br/>\nThe normal world is understandable, in the normal world humans rule the cities, and cities cover the earth. Humans rule, with stolen or granted dominion of the earth.<br/>\nPeople believe in magic..in superstition, and technobable, but its safe, comforting, they believe in guardian angels and gods in their image, in Progress, or the Old Ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic is not safe, it is not comforting, it claws at the world, changing, transforming.  Giving people what they fear, what they want, and sometimes, sometimes what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrainstorming from on rpg.net<br/>\n----<br/>\nMe:<br/>\nI want magic to be trans-formative, a metaphor both for growing up, and social/technological change.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic lets people grow up when they need it.<br/>\nMagic makes people have responsibility before there ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic makes people into what they wish to be, it makes people into what they fight.<br/>\nMagic gives hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisually/naratively PMMM type powers are perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic at least starts off hidden..but that might change as the game goes on. <br/>\n----------------<br/>\nMunicipal:<br/>\nMagic is literally the energy of growing up, which is why it's stronger in young people. (Possibly add some kind of hand-wave about how it's easier to tap in girls if you want an IC explanation for a gender imbalance.) After signing on as a magic girl, all the energy that a girl's body would expend toward growth instead goes toward magic instead, effectively locking her into whatever age she was when she started. Due to its transformative nature, though, it reflects its user's nature, and its user grows to reflect the nature of her magic: A girl who calls on healing magic will find herself growing more gentle, while a ruthless girl might find her powers growing more and more offensively-oriented, maybe even to the point of growing claws or something.<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\nParaphrazed: There are monsters that prey on humanity, and monsters that merely co-exist.  Many Magical Girls simply destroy those who seem obviously non human, feeding on them for power. Others try and cower or impress them, retrain them into a form that can live with humanity or even protect them the other Magical Girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet for all the monsters that are destroyed, there still seem to be monsters to fight, where are the new monsters coming from?<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah..I want about the grimness of new Nobilis, (i.e. a dangerous but also beautiful world, there is hope and wonder among all the nightmares)<br/>\n<br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay rules wise..I like what I have seen of Magical burst, but I want to grant witch/youma like powers to the girls also, and I like how Nobilis can really force examinations of concepts..<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also weary of how fights feel under Magical burst..I haven't played it yet..but it feels rough, not well anime like enough.  I honestly feel like Nobilis combat might be closer to what will work, and the relationship testing thing in MB feels a bit forced..Nobilis style bond breaking might cover that..<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm I might jettison a lot of the Magical Burst rules..but maybe I am just giving to much credit to the game I know better? What do you think? I want commits and criticism, tell me if this just seems like a crazy idea, I wont be hurt (and it might tell me that it is a good idea if the right people hate it..:P)<br/>\n__                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343808/#Comment_343808" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T21:52:02+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  9:52PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool, but I know jack about Nobilis.

I would focus on using the new mortal rules, with the tweak that a character can pick one "mundane" passion or skill and use it for magic. Cool and shine already ooze the source material - after all the example for cool is actually a bishounen. The difficulties chart for mortal actions is really interesting and may very well work for you without modification.  After all you may have defeated the monster ( been effective ) but if you couldn't afford to be productive (i.e. to make your life better) that gives you explicit room for fall out.<br/><br/>As for miraculous magic, I would focus on bonds and afflictions, which can then grant you miracle points. Changing affliction and bond levels may give you what you want in terms of linking personal and magical growth, especially if you associate the miracle points with the bond or affliction they came from. <br/><br/>I suggest that initially you don't want to start with attributes above 0, and even not all the attributes. Treasure 0 seems to be ideal (what is a magical girl without some anchor for her power), and either Domain or Persona 0, but even Aspect 0 doesn't seem to fit things all that well. And, attributes can always be unlocked or raised through the project rules. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HWSoD" title="HWSoD"><img alt="HWSoD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HWSoD">HWSoD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343826/#Comment_343826" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T07:23:48+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  7:23AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

They have a Wish which is how they want to change the world, an Ideal which is their idea of what a magical girl does. (Maybe a Fear or Curse or something?) And an Element(elements) that are a theam that shows in their magic, eventually becoming their familiars.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as they grow the the wish and Ideal warp as they question them selves, and as they apply more magic to them selves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso as they grow, the Wish Ideal and Element start warping the world around them, producing something sort of like a PMMM Witch's [oh god what is it called? Realm] and affecting the people around them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are right about not having Aspect..though more powerful girls end up anchoring their bodies, or abanding their mortal bodies for an anchor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HWSoD" title="HWSoD"><img alt="HWSoD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HWSoD">HWSoD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344429/#Comment_344429" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T13:02:35+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  1:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Character Creation Draft 0:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor both the Ideal and the Wish of those I want to write 3 phrases in order of importance that give nuance to the idea, in order of importance. (that's 3 for the Ideal, and three other ones for the wish).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow chose three mundane skills. (like "looking cute", "Studying", "Being Obnoxious", "Social Bullying", "Sucking Up", "Chess", "Computers") and list them in order of importance to your character. (You can list more then three, but only the first three will count mechanically.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen three 'Tresures' (manifestations of your magic i.e ) (these can be just a finishing attack, or something like a time-stop). You should have one Very-Powerful (That you might not be able to use at chargen with our consuming your self), one Powerful, and and one Simple, and your transformed body. (By default your transformed body makes you mildly super human at combat and athletics. And you gain the ability to directly interact with the magical world. You *do not* though have the ability to create a sanctum/magical area by default.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen describe what you can do with your element, though unlike Special-Powers you can make up new uses for these one the spot.
