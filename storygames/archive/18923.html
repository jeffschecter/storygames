We had decided to start the next arc with these characters in Ammeni to explore political intrigue and social skills. That's what I had to work with when I sat down last night to prep.<br/><br/>Previously when it came time to prep, I would look at the PCs sheets and riff off their Keys and such. "The goblin and the elf both want to learn magic, so let's put a wizard in there. Rose wants to save people so let's give the wizard some helpless followers - I'll make it a ratkin tribe, with a ratkin wizard leader..." That worked ok, but I wanted to try something different.<br/><br/>This time I started by asking what I wanted to see. What would interest me? I read up on Ammeni and immediately thought of a House war. Two Houses in a trade war (like in Star Wars Episode 1) with subterfuge, negotiation, and occasional violence. But I wanted more sides, to get less black-and-white, so I decided the Zaru slaves of the Houses were a third group, wanting freedom for themselves. And then I decided it would be even crazier if the Zaru had a traitor in their midst, but I hadn't decided yet how she would betray them. Ok!<br/><br/>Then I tied them all in to the PCs. Rose the Ammeni thief was returning to free slaves. Well, we already had slaves (who wanted to be freed no less), and I decided that the new leader of one of the Houses was her cousin. So Rose would arrive in town, look up her cousin, and find out she was a slave-owner. Bam! Armitage the elf is Zaru, so the slaves would look to him as a savior/ally, and he wanted to proselytize his new religion to them. And the Zaru traitor would try to steal Armitage's Zu from him, so she would be better equipped to free the slaves on her own. Finally, the new character was a Khalean bard who had moon-metal infused in his body. He would be approached by the other House, because they wanted him to act as a go-between with his homeland and show them how to get moon-metal. Since he's a bard, they could also use his storytelling to smear the name of their opponent, Rose's cousin.<br/><br/>I knew I had a good thing going when I realized I had six (6!) Key Scenes -meeting the cousin, meeting the opposing House, meeting the slaves... I was ready to go.<br/><br/>I was doing the same thing as with my previous prep work: creating situations and tying them into the PCs. All I did was change the order, creating the situation first and then connecting the PCs rather than the other way around. That made all the difference because I was focused only on myself. I created what I wanted, without thinking about the other players, and I would only concern myself with them later. Here's the thing: That's exactly what the other players do. They choose their Keys etc, based on what is interesting to them and them alone. Then and only then do they try to integrate that in with the other people at the table. If I want to see ninjas through the skylight, then that's what happens, and I'll decide later how those ninjas relate to anything.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423196/#Comment_423196" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-19T17:56:01+00:00" title="October 19, 2013  5:56PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's perfectly sensible, and should probably be in some game text somewhere.

I love using the Key framework to develop connections between characters and fictional material. The most fun part is when it develops into a back-and-forth (I sometimes even randomize this part of the process!).<br/><br/>I've usually played the game by coming up with the situation (or at least some of it) first, and then asking the players how they want their characters to be tied into it. Your situation is, "Two Ammeni Houses in trade war; Zaru slaves harbour a traitor [etc, more detail." I pitch something like that to the players, and then they make characters based on that, and choose Keys accordingly: "My character is a freedom fighter, she wants to free the slaves [with appropriately-selected Keys]", and maybe another, "My character is a merchant looking to get rich from this conflict, with no scruples [again, appropriate Keys go here]". <br/><br/>But if I have someone write up a character with a Key that seems unconnected to anything, I ask them to create something connected to that Key. Ok, you've got the Key of the Coward. So what are most scared of? Maybe they say it's a legendary serial killer. If they don't have any idea ready to go, I ask leading questions until I get something: "So, you've chosen the Key of Glittering Gold. What is the most valuable and desirable treasure your character knows about, and how did they learn about it?"<br/><br/>However, once I get those things coming at me, I connect them back to the existing situation, like you're describing. That secret treasure... belongs to the slaves, who carry it as some kind of ancient inheritance. That serial killer... has just been brought back to (un)life by one of the Ammeni Houses -- in secret, of course -- and they're left evidence to make it look like the other House is behind it.<br/><br/>By this point I've got more than enough material, and all of it somehow connected from both ends: on one side, to something cool and exciting I want to bring into the game as the SG, and from the other side to something the player finds interesting and the character is passionately pursuing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/r_donato" title="r_donato"><img alt="r_donato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/539/nGJ3PVU7WMVLV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/r_donato">r_donato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423254/#Comment_423254" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T09:26:38+00:00" title="October 21, 2013  9:26AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome, Paul.

I think of my prep and the players' prep/ideas having "connection points", and then randomize where those connection points come into contact. I combine them as logically as possible (usually by making them one and the same thing).<br/><br/>Here's an example of a favourite technique of mine:<br/><br/>1. Have each player create two really important NPCs (for his character), in vague terms. Let's say the player tells me that NPC 1 is an old mentor/father-figure who is now his nemesis (and picks a relevant key). NPC 2 is someone the character is in love with (Key of Unrequited Love), and would do anything to protect.<br/><br/>The player will probably give me a tiny bit more detail, like a short description of personality trait. Cool. Now, in the meantime, I've been busy too:<br/><br/>2. I create some NPCs who are tied in to my situation. Let's NPC 1 is the legendary serial killer, and NPC 2 is the Zaru slave who is a traitor/spy.<br/><br/>Now I roll some dice, and it tells me to match up player's NPC 1 with my NPC 2, and the player's NPC 2 with my NPC 1. Bringing those connection points together means that:<br/><br/>The first NPC is the PC's old mentor/father-figure (now a nemesis), who, unbeknownst to everyone (we'll reveal this in play) is pretending to be a Zaru slave, but is actually being paid off by the Ammeni. That sounds interesting!<br/><br/>The second NPC is the PC's unrequited love, and someone they'd do anything to protect... but, as it turns out, is now possessed by the spirit of the legendary serial killer.<br/><br/>But imagine doing that with several players, and more NPCs (or objects, or places, or whatever)!<br/><br/>Maybe your second player wrote up an NPC who is a local merchant, someone he depends on for his drug supply. Rolling the dice, we find out that this is... the first character's old mentor, posing as a Zaru slave.<br/><br/>As you can see, once you do this (it's an easy and fun process!), you have more than enough material for a killer game.<br/><br/>If the connections seem forced or too unlikely, you can "soften" them: e.g. instead of the mentor and the spy being one and the same person, maybe they're just working together, or brothers. The point is that they create a point of contact for the characters' Keys - what Apocalypse World calls a PC-NPC-PC triangle.<br/><br/>I've used this a lot now (it's really fun to do with Dogs towns!), and I can't even begin to describe how easy and incredibly fun it is: instant drama with instant buy-in, and it doesn't even feel like you had to do anything as the SG.<br/><br/>Does that help? It's just an example, but I hope it illustrates the general principle. (I also randomize Key combinations to create Key Scenes in a similar way - ask and I can explain if that doesn't make sense.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423293/#Comment_423293" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T08:55:10+00:00" title="October 22, 2013  8:55AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff! I've planned something similar for my Anima/Tenra hack, in the form of 6 sets of open ended questions which could either be positive or negative at random. On each set, the next question is addresed to another player chosen by the the player who answered the previous question, and their answers get translated into aspects for the character (more or less like keys for this case). In the end players get aspects that entwine their stories together and with the NPCs, even creating important past events in the setting.<br/><br/>I like how this builds the whole relationship tree, though I'm keeping in mind that this works better for a game where everyone could be at each other throats, which is what I meant for this hack. I'm relieved to know someone else is using something like this and that it actually works, now I'm more excited to see how mine works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/r_donato" title="r_donato"><img alt="r_donato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/539/nGJ3PVU7WMVLV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/r_donato">r_donato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423311/#Comment_423311" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-23T07:40:36+00:00" title="October 23, 2013  7:40AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, that's a great write-up.

It works like a charm - it's so easy and so effective (and fun to do!) that I use some variation on this every time I play TSoY or a similar game.<br/><br/>Thinking on it further, what it creates is situations and focal NPCs/locations/items which have at least two different character Keys aimed at them. It's like an AW PC-NPC-PC triangle, but with Keys connecting the points. They'll often clash or contradict each other, and create interesting and provocative situations. I once ran a game where PC 1 was in love with the young daughter of the local ruler, and PC 2 had some kind of Key of Fraternity with a sidekick character who was his protege and the most important thing to him in the world. The random process I used told me to combine the sidekick and the young girl. It didn't feel right to make them the same character, so instead I made them lovers. <br/><br/>On top of that, my own write-up of the ruler's daughter provided some reasons why she was in danger (she was promised for marriage to a sadistic and bloodthirsty tyrant who was taking over the region), and anyone getting involved with her would be in even more serious danger.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, this was endlessly interesting in play. It provided me with an instant Key Scene and difficult choices for all the players. The first character is chasing after this girl... who is, in the meantime, shacking up with the other PC's protege. Everyone has a very different take on the situation. Lovesick PC 1 needs to save her, and has a rivalry with the sidekick. The sidekick, meanwhile, is being reckless and getting himself in trouble, drawing in the mentor PC, who needs to extricate him somehow before the tyrant finds out and has him drawn and quartered.<br/><br/>One such situation is probably enough; with, say, two Keys per PC, you'll have three or four to choose from, and plenty of material for several sessions.<br/><br/>I love that I can get this kind of thing just by writing down to barebone NPC ideas I think would be interesting, and then rolling a die. It's so easy, and a fun creative prompt.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, care to share some more details on your approach? It sounds really cool.
