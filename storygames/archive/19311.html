I'd just like to ask quickly what the best way of sharing a design-blog would be and if there's any general wisdom on how to attract interesting opinions? <br/><br/>I guess, content wise, I really want to share my thoughts on art, aesthetics and anthropology in gaming and at the table. Use my degree a bit, yo.<br/><br/>Is there some kind of master directory going on? Feels like everyone here's got a little blog squirreled away somewhere.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430068/#Comment_430068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T06:08:58+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  6:08AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2014 1:58PM by catty_big.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike. <br/><br/>Good to have you here! You're right, most game designers have a blog and/or a G+ page/community. They often also have publicly accessible files on their games-in-progress on either Dropbox or Google Drive. I'd recommend in addition talking about your ideas, even  if its just a mechanic for healing, or a rule about turn order or whatever, on the G+ ReForged community. <br/><br/>There's a forum here called Play Advice; if folks are particularly interested in that sort of thing they'll check in there from time to time- there may even be a way of receiving alerts when people post in it- <a href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">@James_Stuart</a>? Alternatively yu could do what Asif is doing <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development#Item_35" rel="nofollow"> here</a>. <br/><br/>Look forward to hearing your cool game ideas dude <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430079/#Comment_430079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T07:21:22+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  7:21AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I guess I am doing what Asif is doing there, but it seems a little obtrusive if you had, say, more than one subject. <br/><br/>Keeping a play advice "Potemkin" topic I can update and edit would probably work - link to drive files/blog-posts for the interested. No experience with G+, how is it?<br/><br/>My game ideas are sweet. Damn skippy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
