It seems to me that many people say that this inherently puts the <b>story</b> in the GM's hands.  I find this very confusing, because from my point of view, the personalities, dialogue, and actions of the main characters are usually where the meat of the story is.  In semi-Aristotilean terms, for me the core of story is generally in the views of the protagonists, and how they change over the course of the plot.  <br/><br/>So what I'd like to hash out is sources for this disconnect.  <br/><br/>For example, one disagreement might be over what story is.  Someone might think that story is primarily about the external action, like who wins in protagonist-versus-antagonist.  In this case, the GM does really have the lion's share of control, and the views and dialogue of the main characters aren't central.  That would explain things, but I'm not sure who (if anyone) believes this as opposed to something else.  <br/><br/>So what's your view on where main character personality, dialogue, and attempted action falls into for stories?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417178/#Comment_417178" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T18:23:46+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  6:23PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the consequences for character action and decision are the other half of story in the normal sense.

In that way characters can be driven by multiple conflicting motivations, like we are in real life.

Say you have a traditional D&amp;D campaign and over the course of the campaign your chaotic good warrior sees so much horror and so many villains get away with what they do that he becomes jaded and finally corrupted by evil. Cool! Now however the Dungeon Master prepared another innocent village to go to and save, and he's prepared let's say a dungeon under a nearby castle that they would get access to after saving the village. Now our Warrior doesn't want to save the village anymore; he wants to burn it down, take their stuff, and move on. This becomes a problem to the DM who spent his whole weekend preparing the dungeon under the castle. What do?<br/><br/>(There ARE solutions here, but none of them feel very good. "Do not prepare story" is still my preferred solution.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417194/#Comment_417194" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T04:02:49+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  4:02AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2013 4:11AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, back in my very early days of GMing, the player characters were <i>not</i> the main characters of the story.  My NPCs were the main characters, and the PCs were the tools for my audience (the other players) to respond to my story.  As much as the PCs got screen time and die rolls and sheets of stats, none of that had any bearing on the story.  It just gave the players something else to do, as a sort of intermission.  <i>Tired of listening to Dave talk?  Roll to slaughter some orcs!  Describe how badass you are!  Okay, the orcs are all dead, now back to the story.</i><br/><br/>In my early years of roleplaying, this seemed quite common.  Maybe it still is common in RIFTS and GURPS, I don't know.  I think it makes some sense given how many roles were officially and unofficially slotted into "the GM".  <i>If I'm the evening's entertainment, then hell yeah I'm telling the story I want to tell.  Your characters are just there to care and give good reactions and maybe inspire me.</i><br/><br/>If you ask my high school friends about the "story" of those games, the first things they'll recount will be the rare moments where they did something cool that made a big difference.  Maybe about once very few sessions.  The second thing they'll recount will be my NPC-centric plot, which was the bulk of every session.  So, y'know, call that story collaboration if you like, but the ratio is pretty extreme.<br/><br/>I do like your point about views, though.  What did the PCs think of all this?  If you think that's an important part of the "story", then I don't know if I can really disagree.  Most of my efforts at making the players care were aimed at getting the PCs to hate some NPCs and love others.  It basically worked, so I still feel like the script was mine, but the players did flesh it out with some witty lines or other unique responses.  When actors get to improv a lot of lines in a play, does that make it "their story"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417195/#Comment_417195" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T05:39:08+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  5:39AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm reminded of the old discussions of narrativist games on the Forge.

The GM set up situations/challenges and provided the consequences from the  player actions but did not have to pre-plan. In this case the PC dialogs were very important to the story because the story was feeling the tension of deep moral issues and dealing with the messiness of them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417200/#Comment_417200" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T08:42:42+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  8:42AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my first campaign I made finger puppets of the player characters to remind myself who they were.

However, this is not the same thing as control over story.  Many uses of the term "de-protagonized" often shows a horrendous misunderstanding of story, in my opinion.  Consider the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.  If played out as a game, many would say that it is railroaded and the main characters were horrendously "de-protagonized".  They have no control over their lives, and they are forced into the plot of Hamlet to their deaths.  However, they are most certainly the protagonists of the play, and their lack of control in no way makes them into non-protagonists.  <br/><br/>As a similar illustration of railroading, consider the film Escape From New York.  I could create a remake where the hero is an undercover cop committed to saving the world.  This might have the same action and locations, but it would be a vastly different story than the one with Snake Pliskin, in my opinion.  This was generally my experience of railroading GMs.  They could mostly direct the external action to where they wanted, but this wasn't the same thing as absolute control over story.  So in an old Call of Cthulhu campaign, when my PC Benjamin Grimmond started taking investigation in the wrong way, my GM had him kidnapped and tortured to be rescued by the other PCs - which I certainly thought of as railroading and resented at the time.  However, this was a vastly different story than if Grimmond had willingly followed the expected line of action.  <br/><br/>That said, it certainly is possible for the GM to have control over story - especially if the majority of play session time is the GM speaking, which I have seen in some cases.  Even if they don't do this, a GM could take the lead in characters and conflict, and the players could act in supporting roles to what the GM creates, rather than taking the lead in their own material.  However, the point is that players can take the lead in creating material by what their PCs do and say.  It does not necessitate control of external events.  <br/><br/>Indeed, you don't even <i>need</i> external events, since two characters interacting can be a story in itself.  This is something that I see as becoming more prominent as American indie designers interact more with Nordic larp, and vice-versa.  Many larp stories take place with nothing outside of the PCs interacting with each other.  I'm curious to see more fruits of this.  <br/>\n<blockquote>I do like your point about views, though.

A character can improv lines that create their own story, or they could improv lines that simply support the existing story.  <br/><br/>In my experience of tabletop play, I and other players often had strong and interesting characters - and I considered their character development to be an important element of story.  I know that not all games were like this - but this part depended on the players, not the cooperation of the GM.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417211/#Comment_417211" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T10:46:54+00:00" title="June 26, 2013 10:46AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>When we started out back in AD&amp;D days you created a character and the DM created the world.

So if you can't dictate what the <i>players'</i> characters will do, you look elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417234/#Comment_417234" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T16:01:40+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  4:01PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's certainly a common problem with a lot of published campaigns I've come across, where the story centres around a bunch of conflicting NPCs and the PCs are relegated to supporting cast or, at best, antagonists.<br/><br/>Indeed, this is one of the things I found most disheartening before I discovered indie games. I didn't feel I had the time (or ability) to create my own adventures, but most of the published scenarios I found were incredibly railroadery and metaplotty. If only I'd realised quite how unnecessary all that was at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417236/#Comment_417236" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T16:20:31+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  4:20PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When we started out back in AD&amp;D days you created a character and the DM created the world.  You made up name,  rolled 6 stats, your hit points and your starting gold and you were off.  No creating any back story, no friends, no family, no job nothing.  You didnt need that for a typical dungeon crawl but when we tried to get more story oriented play it was a difficult path to negotiate.  Heck as a gm it was hard to figure out what else you needed so I'd often come up with a plotline/story that interested me and just expected the players to get into it.  I found that often failed, wasnt very compelling for them and things would fall back to more hack and slashy fantasy fighting or superhero battles with little on the line but who won the fight.</blockquote>\nSure, there is hack-and-slash gaming where neither player nor GM invest much in story, which is a subset of traditional RPGs (and even some non-traditional ones).  Are you implying that you think this is inherent in the traditional setup of GM and players?  Or is it just one data point in the spectrum of different kinds of traditional RPG play?                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417239/#Comment_417239" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T17:25:40+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  5:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the game writer is the author of the story. The author of the rulebook, after all, by creating the setting and mechanics has the ability to privilege one sort of narrative over another. Story is more than just what happens in the game -- which the game master sets up -- it's also about the themes, moods and emotions explored, and game writers have a lot of control over that.<br/><br/>Give them sword mechanics and monsters to fight and they shall slay dragons! Give them strings on one another and make them teenagers, and they shall dick over their fellow characters! Give them build-able pools of dice and adjective tags, and they shall find lots of reasons to say those words!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
