I haven't decided not to run or play it because it's set during specific events in Poland, but there haven't been that many games going on around me that I've had the opportunity to join in on, probably because there's something that distances players from feeling like its super accessible.

Whether I actually would or not depends on how firm a grasp of the time and events in question the material can grant me and the quality of the guidelines and rules for playing the game.<br/><br/>There's this thing with historical games where it always feels like I know too little to portray things properly, but I also know too much for just hand waving the rest to sit right. If that makes any sense. I suppose if the game could instill a sufficient familiarity of the core situation (including people/places/things) of play, then I would be more inclined to do whatever other research I feel is necessary to round out my knowledge of the setting.<br/><br/>As for the science fiction version, I might write it off as yet another generic sounding sci-fi game.

The biggest reason is the image of farmboys following their fathers into the city to get factory jobs, having lost their ancestral land a century ago and now forced off the landlords' land and into the mills. <br/>Farm foreclosures, people forced to get dangerous and low-paying jobs, rich oligarchs grabbing up all the land... there's a great many parallels, rough or otherwise, to our own times. <br/>Slavery is also an interesting theme, something legal in Britain for another 22 years (1833). Historically (at least in the US), white wage employees were often told they could be replaced with slaves (or free blacks, after 1865), putting them at odds with people in a situation very similar to their own. <br/>Capturing that sense of dispossession will be critical, I think, to conveying just how terrifying and unbalancing powerful new technologies were - small-time weavers and textile artisans were put out of business in the thousands by more powerful, productive firms that had hundreds of employees working side-by-side.This plays into the theme of overcrowding and the growth of mass society, soon former artisans (a sizeable, if poor, middle class in Britain in the 1700s) were forced into similar states of mass labor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322168/#Comment_322168" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T04:23:22+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  4:23AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Luddites represent a pivotal moment in Western civilisation (and from there, world development).

This mental exercise is really predicated on my experience with <i>Grey Ranks</i>, a game that is well regarded and rarely played. So as my thoughts drift to another fascinating and tragic moment in history, I wonder how to shape that into a game that will be well regarded and played a lot.<br/><br/>I definitely see the "common language" all around me - almost anyone (non gamers included) can effortlessly slot into fantasy or sci-fi tropes at the table, but history panic (excellent term, thanks Rob) is sort of universal (non gamers, interestingly, excluded).<br/><br/>I suspect the "common language" level of engagement with sci-fi is just a convenient gloss rather than a thoughtful use of what the form has to offer, as Ben suggests.

The first is the historical anxiety that everyone's been talking about. Your invocation of Grey Ranks is insightful: I own it but have never managed to get enough people interested to play. I suspect you might encounter a similar problem here, with the mix of very specific historical context and the foregone conclusion that the Luddites utterly failed in whatever they thought their mission actually was.<br/><br/>An alternate/SF setting does a couple of things: it gives players the possibility of exploring different outcomes that would feel much more organic than twisting our actual history into knots, and it also provides the players the possibility of much greater identification. I suspect it would suck to lose your factory job and be unable to try and get another because of illiteracy and the inability to move freely, but those are conditions I am not familiar with, nor, I suspect, are most of your literate, white, White Collar audience. An SF-ish setting can take those historical conditions and transpose them over an information economy that the players are probably much more familiar with from their own lives. Any game dealing with manufacturing would essentially qualify as fantasy to any of the Story Gamer types I know, they all have information economy and service economy jobs.<br/><br/>I do approve of your continued fascination with lost causes either way, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322184/#Comment_322184" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T06:25:59+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  6:25AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might be a bit off-track, but is there a way to combine the two, not in a "hey, look at us time travelling" kind of way, but in a sort of "what has happened will happen again" kind of way? <br/>\n<br/>\nAssume four players, with two players are playing in some historical known past setting, and two players are playing in a future setting.

First, I think the "Seznam rebellion on Jorca-12" sounds fake.  It's *totally* something I would make up off the cuff for a game and it would bother me for the length of the game because it sounds silly.  Second, I actually think it's important that people know about the particular historical issues this game could deal with.  The Luddites are mocked as an icon by a vast  swath of people know next to nothing about what they were experiencing.  Being afraid of watching your children starve is way more sensible than being afraid of abstract technology.  So, while your game might explore exactly the same human issues in either setting, it seems like it could do more good by keeping it real.  (But I guess the trade-off of not reaching as many consumers is a valid concern.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322192/#Comment_322192" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T07:35:20+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  7:35AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You weren't on Jorca-12, dude.

It depends on what this person's goal is:  do they want people to play a historical game, or do they want people to play a game which explores these historical concepts?  How important is it that the players learn about London in 1811?  Is it more important than the players roleplaying what it's like to be left holding the short end of the industrialization stick?<br/><br/>If it's all about Learning Y'all Some History, then yeah: an appendix that says "Okay, fuck learning some history, here's how you can make it a science fiction game with the same premise" is going to dilute the original intent.  But if it's more about having the experience and less about learning the specific historical trappings of it all, then why not avoid History Panic and having to figure out a way to quickly teach newbies all about 1811 London?<br/><br/>In fact, in that case it might make MORE sense to use some fantasy or science fiction setting and stick in an appendix or some sidebars to reveal that it's actually the same setup as a game about the Luddites and all this Regency stuff: that's fun stuff, and says to the reader, "these historical facts are a creative resource for you: you don't <i>need</i> to know them or use them when you play, but they're so cool that you'll probably <i>want</i> to."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322194/#Comment_322194" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T07:45:31+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  7:45AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried answering this three different times, and deleted all of them before posting.

Seriously. This is on topic with like, every piece of media I consumed yesterday.<br/><br/>I was just reading <a href="http://io9.com/#!5796519/if-kurt-vonneguts-slaughterhouse+five-had-come-out-a-few-years-later-we-might-never-have-heard-of-it" rel="nofollow">this article</a> yesterday on the guy who wrote Kurt Vonnegut's biography. The gist was that Kurt was working on this war tale for 20 years, and he didn't think it would be really all that relevant to the audience that far removed from the war. But...<br/><br/><i>Then two weeks before Slaughterhouse-Five arrived in bookstores in early March 1969, the North Vietnamese attacked Saigon and more than one hundred South Vietnamese towns and military targets, killing approximately one hundred Americans in the first fifteen hours. During the first week of March, 453 Americans died, the highest losses in nearly a year. All 10,000 copies of the first edition of Slaughterhouse-Five sold out almost immediately, and the novel that Vonnegut had complained, "reads like a telegram" reached number one on the New York Times Best Seller list.</i><br/><br/>This seems totally related to your question. You're worried about writing something historical that people might not play, and you might fall back on sci-fi to make it more accessible. I have a few thoughts.<br/><br/>1 - combine the two Vonnegut style<br/>2 - make it impactful and relevant to current events, Battlestar galactica style, if you go with the sci-fi version (sci-fi commentary on historical tragedies seems more impactful to me if it becomes tied to a place in the present as well, since its already tied to a place in the past)<br/>3 - make the Regency setting equally as accessible by tying it to current events/feelings as well!<br/><br/>I'm torn on which I like better. The Regency setting sounds just as awesome and alien as Jorca-12. Historical settings and sci-fi settings are so similar in my RPG mind. Part of me wants to tell you to do sci-fi though, because we need more quality sci-fi. And I watched this William Gibson interview movie (No Maps for These Territories) last night that's got me rollin on ideas with cyborgs again. But that's just my biased opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322227/#Comment_322227" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T09:08:56+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  9:08AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note that Dogs in the Vineyard gets a lot more play than Jedi in the Vineyard.

We cut most of them out of the final draft, our reasoning being that it felt wishy-washy, like we couldn't decide what rules we actually wanted to use. I think it would have weakened the core game, but now that the rules are well established, it's nice to see some of that variation coming out in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322245/#Comment_322245" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T10:11:03+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 10:11AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would choose the Luddite option, assuming the following conditions:<br/><br/>1.

Setting it in actual history feels too restrictive and scary to me, because I'm the sort of person who wouldn't feel qualified to do that without four years of research into the time period. Alternatively, sci-fi is nice, but we have plenty of sci-fi already. What DitV did that is unique, in my opinion, is distill the essential aspects of a historical time period in such a coherent way that it's incredibly easy to incorporate "actual" history, without the danger of history panic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322254/#Comment_322254" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T11:00:50+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 11:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2011 11:07AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite>I would strongly vote for some sort of alternate history game, along the lines of Dogs in the Vineyard.</blockquote>\nThe other game in all this takes place during the British Revolution.
