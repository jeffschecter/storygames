                    I got to the FLGS for their Minicon this weekend, and had a chance to play a demo of Cold City. I had a pretty good time, soaked up a lot of atmosphere ( I guess that's what I do instead of character immersion), and generally enjoyed myself.<br/><br/>Now, I also bought Cold City, but didn't have a chance to look through it before the game ( I actually avoided  doing so in case the demo was in the book). When I got home and read it, I realized that mostly the sitaution and setting were used by the GM, with only bits of system. On the pure enjoyment level, the game was a hit for me, but I was sort of weirded out by the way the game I played in and the sorts of games the rules seemed to imply were somewhat at odds.<br/><br/>Looking through the rules, though, I did notice a lack of GM advice for engaging the system. Except for our character sheets, we players didn't have a whole lot of "what do we do in this game" info, either. So, basically, we went into CoC mode. It worked out but we seemed to miss some key stuff the game designer seemed to care a lot about.<br/><br/>For discussion:<br/>You've designed a game. Great. Now it's time to design an intro for the game, meant to be played by folks who really don't know your system. No, you aren't going to be the one demoing it. You have to build something that another GM can run, pretty much from just that packet/adventure and _maybe_ a general reading of the rulebook. Also, assume the players have at most heard very vague stuff about the game.<br/><br/>What goes into that packet? For the players, for the GM, whatever. How do you insure those nifty mechanics you took all that time to develop get used to their full potential.<br/><br/>( Elliot-if you're reading this thread feel free to pop in, since you played that game too).                </div>

                            Hi,<br/><br/>So, could I ask for more detail about the demo? Particularly wondering about the length of demo (15 minute thing or a longer game [from your description, it seems like alonger game]) and what elements of the mechanics were left out/left in. <br/><br/>Certainly, with my own 15 minute demos, I've deliberately structured them to show players key mechanical aspects (Hidden Agendas, Trust, how the basics work) and give a basic flavour of the setting. And I'm fairly sure the demo is runnable by others who are familiar with the game, although I lack any empirical evidence for this!<br/><br/>In the context of the game, what ywould you look for as "GM advice for engaging the system"? It's probably difficult for me to make any kind of balanced judgement about the advice offered within the game, so your opinion would be valuable. Obviously, I do see worthwhile GM advice contained within the text that highlights and reinforces the importance of mechanical elements such as Hidden Agendas and so on, but as I said, I could be biased here!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>

                            Details:<br/>It was four hour game with five folks who basically just met. Sometimes play was bit difficult due to the fact that the folks behind us were playing a much rowdier game of something ( Mountain Witch, maybe?). None of us except the GM had seen the rulebook ( to my knowledge), although we had a basic idea about the setting and situation. We were using the characters from the book, plus a German officer from perhaps a download?<br/><br/>The thing is, mostly we just dealt with system in terms of the main dice rolling system. We never engaged in combat, and we never really dealt with Consequences, which after having read the rules I realized was a Very Big Deal.<br/><br/>Also,Trust really didn't come up much. Partly, I suspect, because we didn't use the second Trust column. Am I right in assuming that you are supposed to know what the other characters' trust in your character is? Or is that supposed to be secret from you?<br/><br/>We also didn't get into the reasons for Trust scores. Reading the book, my impression is that the initial Trust score should be based on a "Thing" ( personal quality, past event) on a One for One basis. For beginners, with pregens, it would have been cool to know why Danvers Trusted Walters specifically, but Chergenevsky very little ( beyond the Cold War stereotyping).<br/><br/>Note, we were definitely more in Monster Hunter mode than Backstabby Cold Warriors mode, so that might be part of it. <br/><br/>Some General things:<br/>We really didn't have much engagement with our hidden agendas. For GM advice, I'd probably emphasize that somewhere, maybe suggesting always having something like a Bang around that ties to those agendas.<br/><br/>The other thing was Party Splitting. It did come up once or twice, but it seems like something that is  capital "I" Important. Without Party Splitting, it's a lot harder to engage Hidden Agendas and mess with Trust.<br/><br/>I'd maybe also put something in there about _always_ making sure to deal with Consequences and Trust changes at the end of a scene, and perhaps have some advice on bringing the other players into those decisions, especially if a scene has also combined with a Party Splitting.<br/><br/>For Emphasis: I really did have a good time at the game itself. It was only after coming home and checking out the rulebook that I got this weird bunch of questions stuck in my head.<br/><br/>Also for emphasis:<br/>Although my questions are using my Cold City game as an example, the core design questions really are about games more generally regarding a demo/first game for folks first encountering your system.                        </div>

                            I have a <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/roach/demo/revised_demo_script.pdf" rel="nofollow">demo script for The Roach</a> that is the result of seven jillion Gen Con pitches.  It is fifteen minutes long and offers the essence of the game while selectively choosing which system bits to share.                        </div>
