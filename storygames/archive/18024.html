The mechanics of what I did are on the thread Paul_T kindly linked to. My own observation, from having done this precisely once, is that it worked really well, despite the actual Fiasco game maybe not being as good as Fiasco usually gets. (This may be because I truncated the second act to save time.)<br/><br/>If you're going to do more than just use the setup, my advice would be to modify the Tilt &amp; Aftermath to make them more amenable to starting a new game. My Fiasco characters tend to end up dead, in jail, or broken wrecks of humanity (the system works!), but that's not going to help you kick off another game immediately after. (Unless of course the game is about dead people, prisoners, or broken wrecks of humanity. Hrm. That's three good ideas for a Fiasco playset right there...) This will go double if you, as I was, are planning to run something longer than a session or two.<br/><br/>Other than that, I say go for it! I think the fact that a Fiasco playset channels your choices made it work better than, say, Minimus might--although not everyone will be as enthralled with the loss of total control over their PC. (One of my players found the Fiasco portion of the session wasn't really in keeping with his character conception, although in the end I think he was very satisfied with how it all came together.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407497/#Comment_407497" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T10:16:20+00:00" title="February 27, 2013 10:16AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, there's a lot of interesting moving parts in Fiasco, you could pretty readily adapt the mechanics...<br/><br/>You've got a resolution mechanic whereby all scenes tend towards one of two outcomes. In Fiasco, it's positive vs. negative, but it could just as easily be two diametrically-opposed alternatives which are strongly tied into the themes of the game. For instance, a film noir variant might simply cop to moral vs. immoral, because of how the genre explores the tendency of characters to get muddied up. The color of the die would determine the methods that the character uses to achieve their aim...or even fail to achieve it. (Though keep in mind how players are asked to give up control if they want to control the setup of the scene. Actually, if you wanted to, you could have the Setup of a scene roll in success/failure. In our film noir case, it would be something like "I want to set up a scene where I dish out a beating on the thugs." or "I want to set up a scene where the femme fatale snookers me.")<br/><br/>That resolution mechanic then keys into the game at two key junctures, and you could probably insert more (although that would make the Tilt/Aftermath-style rolling less standout). These are the points where fortunes change, where the situation develops in an unexpected way, where your choices so far directly impact your standing in the world.<br/><br/>Naturally, there's also the setup. But that's easily ported. What's important to note is how the setup generates a tension of antagonism between the players. It's a case of "not enough to go around", of conflicting desires. You could play with it to generate something totally different, such as "everyone has something precious that someone else needs", which could create a game about people learning to build their lives back together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407955/#Comment_407955" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T07:52:49+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  7:52AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My Fiasco characters tend to end up dead, in jail, or broken wrecks of humanity (the system works!), but that's not going to help you kick off another game immediately after.</blockquote>\nI think one way to approach this is that the characters and events in your Fiasco pre-game become the NPCs and back-story for your following game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407959/#Comment_407959" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T08:03:09+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  8:03AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be fun to play a game of Fiasco dealing with powerful people (in charge of corporations/nations/businesses/the court), and then create characters who are the underlings for those people, or the ones who now need to step up and take responsibility.
