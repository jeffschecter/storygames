You can't dis-empower the dominant culture by reducing it to stereotypes, no matter how inaccurate. You can have all the schoolmarms you want, it doesn't matter that 25% of teachers were men. Schoolmarm is a much different stereotype (white, frontier school teaching women, of the dominant Anglo-Saxon American cultural background) than Brave (dozens, if not hundreds of wildly different races and cultures being lumped into a single warrior icon).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I know the best approach would be to use specific tribal research (so as not to lump in a bunch of distinct cultures into one fake culture) but maybe 1/15th of the cards would be depicting native peoples, so there's like 0 space for depth.</blockquote>\nSounds like you have 6% room for depth. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Sure you have no room for any explanation of the historical and cultural accuracies that you've researched, but it will show to those who care.  You asked, so clearly you are concerned about minimizing offense.  My guess is that the representation would mostly be art in a game like this, so that might not even come into play for this challenge.  But minimal visibility means you don't need to do a whole lot of research. It would still be good to do some.<br/><br/>My suggestion would be to focus on a specific tribe. And then from there, figure out the voice of the game. While Indian is no longer a widely accepted term, it's more ignorant than directly racist or offensive (and even has some proponents among native peoples). So you could use it, along with things like schoolmarm, because the voice of the game is 19th century vocabulary. On the other hand, pioneers were not idiots, and they quickly learned the names of the different tribes and cultures around them. You could certainly use tribal names on your cards. I would avoid reinforcing native stereotypes, however. For example, don't make all the Apache cards as hostile to fight, while all the Hopi cards are willing to talk and trade. You might not have enough cards to really go that route. In that case, I would focus on fewer tribes (or one) and presenting them as a variety, over presenting the variety of possible tribes.<br/><br/>Deciding on a specific culture should also establish the setting of your game, too. Is it gold rush west coast (probably not), the silver miners of the Rockies or the southern deserts, or the homesteaders of frontier plains?<br/><br/>The Lakota are possibly the most iconic of native cultures of what became the USA, particularly as gets applied broadly to a picture of "Indians." They were also involved in some of the longest running hostilities between European Americans and Native Americans since the days of the New England colonies, lasting for most of the 19th century, so having them appear as possible antagonists in addition to people to negotiate with is fitting.  That puts you concretely into the high plains, however. If you're going for something specific, like Tombstone style gunfights and desert towns, you could style them after the Apache instead. They also were at the center of a lot of heated hostilities.<br/><br/>Both of these tribes were known by their neighbors as hostile and warlike - certainly a stereotype exaggerated by cross-cultural prejudice trying to sway an apparently neutral party (white men) - but not entirely uncalled for. Americans arrived onto the scene shortly after some serious population migrations and wars of conquest that had occurred after the introduction of the horse.<br/><br/>An additional idea to try and paint a broader picture is to include events that show hostilities perpetrated by invading Americans. Things like broken treaties, illegal settlement, illegal prospecting, organized extinction and genocide, casual murder, kidnapping, rape and other violence free from legal repercussion (if not state sanctioned). The main problem with the depiction of violent Indians isn't that it's untrue, it's that romantic depictions of the west portrayed violence from Native Americans as unwarranted attacks on an innocent people just trying to make a new life on the frontier. That was never the case in the eyes of the various tribes.  Simply using your small set of cards to depict both sides of the story would go a long way towards avoiding offense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360914/#Comment_360914" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T17:02:19+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  5:02PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Pulp Poet<br/>Thanks for the thoughtful response.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I'll leave native peoples out for now and if there's ever anything like a future expansion give them a whole set of 72 cards to call their own. Even though the game's depiction of the west is purposefully stereotypical, I don't feel like I can do any justice in a few fringe cards without falling too heavily on troupes that I know would be too simplistic just for the reasons that you  indicate (that its very different to use stereotypes from a minority culture that is often relegated to stereotypes). For what its worth there are no cards depicting black slaves or former slaves, Chinese workers, Mexicans or Americans with a Latin heritage or other non-majority peoples who played a prominent role in the settlement of the American west. While hopefully this isn't whitewashing by exclusion, I don't think I can give a broad enough representations of different peoples to include them in a game that is essentially about killing people and taking their stuff, a la D&amp;D and that consists of a single deck of cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360920/#Comment_360920" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T17:24:05+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  5:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>@ Hans c-o<br/><br/>Well, I mean, Marshals and Gunfighters are also Adversaries and Schoolmarms and Bartenders are Encounters.

I don't think you're choice is between absolute accuracy through depiction of common racial roles or 1930's films pretending it was all white people and savage Indians.<br/><br/>If you were getting art done (or picking copyright free stuff), you could un-whitewash it that way. There's no need to speak for the non-majority experience. Having a black schoolmarm or a Chinese cowboy is certainly unusual, but not impossible. Have some non-white characters depicted without any textual or mechanical difference, and you can aim for inclusion without attempting social commentary (which it sounds like isn't the purpose anyway, so having ex-slaves would work against your purposes).<br/><br/>And if you're not doing character art (or something like monochrome silhouettes), then there's no need to call attention to the race of any figures, and sometimes even gender. You can leave it as nebulous as possible and players will fill in their own blanks.<br/><br/>Inclusion can be hard, but it doesn't need to be THAT hard. The thoughtfulness and sensitivity to the issue you clearly have is a great sign. You'll never be able to please everyone. Just think of who your audience is and what they'll appreciate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360945/#Comment_360945" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T19:18:36+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  7:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=360928" id="CommentID_360928" rel="nofollow" title="Double click to copy as current format (Html)"></a>Take into account that the western settlement is the most efficient and effective genocide in modern history.<br/><br/>In that light: would you write it about Jews, in WW2?
