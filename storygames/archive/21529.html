As a general rule, I would never activate a PC's Darkest Self - let the other rules make that happen when it does, because doing so has such immense impact on the player's experience of their character.<br/><br/>As (I seem to remember) Avery says in the book, that should be a rare occurence... but there may be a moment in play where it's just clear to *everyone* that the Darkest Self should happen, and that's when you may consider doing so as the MC.<br/><br/>I think that, personally, even under those circumstances I would prefer to frame it as a choice. "The only way out of this mess is to give in to the monster within you. Do you want to do that, embrace that dark aspect of your self? Or will you hold on to your humanity and take the blow that's coming?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
