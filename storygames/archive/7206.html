The system is so open that this can lead to paralysis. It'd be better to do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guided</span> creation, where the choices go into slots or you have lists or something (eg see QMR Character Assistant).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161033/#Comment_161033" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T13:54:04+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  1:54PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Tim: Though I haven't played ZoZ, I've played Fudge-based games, and one shots of Dead Inside and the like (same system).  In those, for a one shot it's always easier to make characters in advance than to have the players come up with them.  The paralysis thing is very real.  Also, with that hour of chargen you could have been playing like 45 minutes of it.<br/><br/>When I have players make their characters together at a one-shot game, it means that either we're playing "Dread: The First Book of Panedmonium", or we're playing anything else, and I'm stalling for time and ideas, willingly sacrificing 1 hour plus to give me some time to come up with an adventure. Sweating, perhaps.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
