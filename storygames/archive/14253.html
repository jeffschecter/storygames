I am perfectly willing to hack something together, but I'm not even sure what base system to use. I would like your suggestions/advice. Here are the things I would want from the game:<br/><br/>- Reasonably rules-light. It doesn't have to be stripped down to 20 pages, but I REALLY don't want to play the <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> RPG which has 18 different stats. That's just stupid.<br/>- Built for diplomacy/scheming/social duelling.<br/>- Latitude for both personal and potentially large-scale (state-level or national) interplay and relationships.<br/>- Cool stuff with interpersonal relationships (like Hx in <i>Apocalypse World</i> or the Attribute Auction in <i>Amber Diceless</i>, which pits players against each other right from the character creation process) would be cool.<br/><br/><i>Burning Wheel</i> seems to lean toward what I imagine everyone would suggest, but even that might be a little too rules-heavy for the group I'm thinking of. I'm not discounting it, but I'd like to see what ideas anyone else has.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323488/#Comment_323488" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-08T18:10:12+00:00" title="May  8, 2011  6:10PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The books read to me like a straight up fantasy hack of <i>Apocalypse World</i>.

I finally decide that one of the versions of <i>Hero Wars/HeroQuest</i> rules would work best for how the fun I see in the setting:<br/><br/>* Stats are what the players define them to be: "Cunning" "Loyal," "Swordsman," "Tomboy," "Mother," "Herbalist" whatever... <br/><br/>* Extended Contests can scale from a one-on-one duel to a war between nations<br/><br/>* You can also make Stat connected to other Characters ("Hates King Robert," "Loves His Wife Fiercely," "Never Trusts a Lanister," and so on), which Players can call upon to "Augment" actions involving those other characters or relationships<br/><br/>* Hero Points can be used to cement objects or items or relationships with people, institutions or communities with for Player Characters. This allows events that occur during a session to really matter because the Player says, "This thing that happened here really matters," marking shifts in alliances and relationships and alliances.<br/><br/>* When playing in Glorantha, Characters get a bunch of Stats by virtue of selecting Homeland, Occupation, and Magic -- which also nail down loyalty and future conflicts for Characters with opposing views of the world based on those selections. For Game of Thrones (and forgive me, I only know the television series) I'd go with Homeland, Occupation and Family.<br/><br/>I think <i>Hero Wars</i>/<i>HeroQuest</i> would give you the flexibility you seek while still remaining an simple and elegant engine. (And note, you could simply strip out any concerns of magic from the Glorantha based rules. This would make yanking out the core engine very simple.)<br/><br/>Here's a <a href="http://www.glorantha.com/support/GameAidsBooklet.pdf" rel="nofollow">HeroQuest PDF cheat sheet</a> (it folds into a booklet) that you could use to get a glimpse of how the rules work and the game is set up.

It isn't used in <i>In A Wicked Age...</i> because the fiction the game is going after, especially Tanith Lee's work, doesn't really have Shame as a punishment for characters. But Shame is a big deal in <i>Game of Thrones</i>.<br/><br/>I'd have all the players (Game Master and Players) all hammer out evocative imagery from the setting and nail them down as the Oracle. I'd focus less on specific names or families, and make them "empty sets" waiting to be filled by a player, "A brother watches his sibling with anger in his heart" and things along those lines.<br/><br/>Rather than have the "whole world" in motion, a session, just like any session using the Anthology Engine, would revolve around the machinations of Best Interests between characters in conflict. We'd find out how <i>this</i> story of <i>these</i> characters in conflict came to a conclusion.<br/><br/>But that's also why I sort of backed away. It feels like <i>Game of Thrones</i> wants a system that can feel expansive about the world -- like a novel or long form cable series, while Anthology Engine seems amazing in delivering compact short stories or novellas one after another on a book shelf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323500/#Comment_323500" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-08T19:07:23+00:00" title="May  8, 2011  7:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2011 7:25PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>That's really interesting.

(In my view, the rhythms of the story will be defined by the results of the rolls, thank you very much. Let's roll and find and then we'll know if things are going well or badly for our heroes.)<br/><br/>I just want you to know that if you read 2nd, that's a new thing and if you like it, awesome, and if you don't, rip it out. Not a deal breaker. But it's not one of the features I was thinking about when I recommended the game.<br/><br/><br/>Also,<i> Hero Wars</i> (and its <i>HeroQuest</i> children) was designed specifically for a big, sprawling setting (Glorantha) at war, with people tied deeply to conflicting communities and faiths. The fact that Greg Stafford wanted a game to handle a situation in Glorantha (families at war, tribes at war, nations at war, faiths at war) seemed a natural fit for the core situation in <i>Game of Thrones</i> This is another reason I'm recommending 1st edition <i>HeroQuest</i>. You'll be able to see how the Glorantha conflict color text maps clearly onto the narrative possibilities of <i>Game of Thrones</i> play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323502/#Comment_323502" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-08T19:25:09+00:00" title="May  8, 2011  7:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite><i>Burning Wheel</i>seems to lean toward what I imagine everyone would suggest, but even that might be a little too rules-heavy for the group I'm thinking of.

It's kind of a sequel to a previous similar game we played in high school, except back then we used D&amp;D with only the NPC classes from the DMG.<br/><br/>Once I decided I wanted to resurrect/continue that old game I hit a similar conundrum: what system to use? Ultimately I realized what we really needed to kick off was a freeform structure, to which we would add mechanics as needed as we go along. What we have now is really just a bundle of principles and guidelines that are sort of like a hack of Montsegur 1244, Archipelago II and Trollbabe, except completely without any mechanical bits. GM-less, scene framing, character polygamy, "stakes" questions driving/aiming play.<br/><br/>The next step is to introduce some hard rules and crunch.

(In my view, the rhythms of the story will be defined by the results of the rolls, thank you very much. Let's roll and find and then we'll know if things are going well or badly for our heroes.).</blockquote>\nVery briefly, Moon Design/Issaries made HeroQuest (first edition) available as a PDF, but I don't think it is any more.<br/><br/>HeroQuest v2 strips down the core of the rules, and the core rulebook is more like Fudge (a toolkit) than a full-on game. Although, like Fudge, it's probably quite straightforward to play with just that book if you're willing to put in some time and thought.<br/><br/>I was part of the playtest group for the second edition of HQ, and to me the "dramatic difficulty setting" works quite well to let the referee easily set difficulties within the context of having play sessions that "feel like TV shows or movies". The burden on the referee for prep is lightened considerably.<br/><br/>HQ v1 is rather intimately tied to Gloranthan gaming in one sense: the rules for magic come pretty strongly from the Gloranthan worldview on magic. Since GoT inhabits a magic-quite-low world, you're probably quite happy not to need this, and so HQv2's stripped down approach is a benefit. (If you wanted to use HQv2 for playing in Glorantha, then you pretty much need to the core books, plus the first massive campaign tome, because it contains all the updated rules for how magic works in that setting.)<br/><br/>HQ's big drawback to me for the GoT setting is that it's just not really "gritty" enough: you can play it that way, sure, through "description" and such, but it's really meant to show large-scale action hero action. GoT's lethality doesn't map well to this, I think.<br/><br/>The games that leap out at me: Burning Wheel, Riddle of Steel, HarnMaster.<br/><br/>These are arranged on a scale from "more narrative to less narrative".<br/><br/>I rather suspect that Riddle of Steel is an excellent fit, and, really, the rules are not all that complex (especially if you dispense with magic entirely).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323541/#Comment_323541" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T07:03:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  7:03AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see using John Wick's Blood and Honor if you wanted to do something like a Stark Family where there is plenty of intrigue but whatever you do blows back on the whole family (via the shared honor pool).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323628/#Comment_323628" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:27:54+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:27PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite><i>Burning Wheel</i>seems to lean toward what I imagine everyone would suggest, but even that might be a little too rules-heavy for the group I'm thinking of.

I bought it a year or so ago and then took a look at the character cration process, shuddered and put it on the shelf, more or less not to be touched since. Giving it a thorough perusal, though, I've found two things that I like about the game. One is the chapter on building a House. There's a lot of steps to it, and might take a couple of hours, but when you're done there's going to be no question about where your clan is located, who they pledge fealty to, their history, strengths, weaknesses and any other details that need detailing. And it can be pretty much lifted wholesale out of the book without any major modifications needed. Transplant anywhere. <br/><br/>The other thing I like is that, while there are templates, there are no definitive character classes. Your characters can be anyone you want them to be--just build them to be that person. That's one of the major stumbling blocks I see in adapting GoT to, say, Apocalypse World. AW encourages your characters to slide between playbooks, whereas in Westeros it's mostly inconceivable that a Maester would become the Lord of a Keep. So why not just use the SoIaF rules, then? Because they read like an accounting text book. *shudder*<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Burning_Kingdoms" rel="nofollow">I have the cure for what ails you.</a>Something a friend and I hacked together a few years ago.

It looks great, but there's just no way I'd want to run this with any of my current groups. Kudos, though.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>I could see using John Wick's Blood and Honor if you wanted to do something like a Stark Family where there is plenty of intrigue but whatever you do blows back on the whole family (via the shared honor pool).</blockquote>\nThis sounds more like what I'm looking for. I did some cursory research on the game and it seems like more or less what I'm looking for, but also seems like it will take a fair amount of effort to reskin it from Japanese to Western tropes. It might just be worth it, though. It appears to emphasize the same things I would consider important in a GoT campaign (especially one set in a single household, struggling against their obligations and outside world, which is how I'd want to play it).<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>I rather suspect that Riddle of Steel is an excellent fit, and, really, the rules are not all that complex (especially if you dispense with magic entirely).</blockquote>\nCan you tell me a bit more? I've never read Riddle of Steel and I don't know anything about it. What sets it apart from other gritty fantasy games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323750/#Comment_323750" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T10:27:18+00:00" title="May 10, 2011 10:27AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's based around very personal internal conflicts, but inevitably escalates to nation-changing events.
