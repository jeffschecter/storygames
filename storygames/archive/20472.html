Basically, after players pick their characters but before they assign their skills, state as a requisite that every character should have a clear role in the group recognized by all the PCs, one that is crucial in any battle. Then decide how their usual battle plan would go and the order in which they will take their actions, foregoing rolling initiative order except to decide if the players or the antagonist go first.<br/><br/>Let's try with D&amp;D. Players decide their battle plan would go as this: the ranger goes first drawing the enemy's attention. Fighter goes second charging to meet the enemy and preventing them to reach the back ranks. Then goes the paladin either protecting the casters, helping the fighter or buffing up to for a big hit the next round. Wizard's turn then to figure out any weakness of the opponent if the ranger hasn't found any, and then apply the proper buff to the right party member for the job.<br/><br/>So basically players can develop any battle plan, the GM uses this forced initiative order to help them stick to it; but yet anyone can easily see how there will still be many variations on this, how opportunities can change it slightly and bad rolls can wreck it (though you can give one re-roll or advantage to a single roll in the encounter or turn, that any player can use. Of course, that applies only each time the party goes for a battle plan they have practiced enough and are all familiar with)<br/><br/>Going against many opponents with different initiatives? assign a fixed turn interval between each player. Say, PC with highest initiative rolls a 16. We arbitrarily make the interval to be 4. That means the next player acts in initiative count 12, the next at 8 and the last at 4. You roll for the NPCs and assign them to the right initiative count. You can find a more fair interval by comparing the PCs with the highest and lowest Dex and dividing the difference by the number of players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109" title="icemaster109"><img alt="icemaster109" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109">icemaster109</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449997/#Comment_449997" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T19:41:40+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  7:41PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So my game Utpost (freely availible but only in Swedish) is about an isolated group of people on an outpost in space.

Specifically, the Night side of the Night/Day divide in that game has one player assign everyone into roles for a bombing run. One character must navigate to the site, another must lead the attack run, and others are assigned as wing women who can essentially intercept consequences. Everyone can pull from a pool of bonuses that are accumulated though actions during the Daytime part of the game, which represents a sort of "team spirit."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450258/#Comment_450258" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-01T14:30:28+00:00" title="January  1, 2016  2:30PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, people working as a team to murder a huge creature (aka the "dragon fight"): why <i>not</i> some iteration of D&amp;D, specifically? Answering this may help you pick from the many suggestions you got already.<br/>Additionally, one more game which focuses very much on this, and I can't see mentioned in this thread, is <i>Mythender</i>.<br/><br/>Second, trust between team-members as an issue: most AW-derivatives have mechanics for this, owing to Hx rules in AW, which in turn are based on <i>The Mountain Witch</i>. Malcolm Craig's games (<i>Cold City</i> and <i>Hot War</i>) are also descended from TMW.<br/>Ultimately, before you choose or design your own system for this, you need to decide how much the issue of trust and betrayal is genuine, central and plot-driving: in TMW it's definitely the core everything else revolves around, and in AW it's pretty close to it, whereas for example in Dungeon World it's reduced to more of a characterization thing \u2014 with friendly banter and a pretense of rivalry being standard, but actual betrayal being off the table.\n<blockquote>Definitely take a look at Anima Prime : <a href="http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/</a><br/></blockquote>\nI'd definitely second that if the OP's looking for something on the "DW" end of the trust-and-betrayal spectrum. AP has it built in for the main characters to bicker mid-battle for re-rolls and mechanical goodies (see Traits), but definitely cannot deal with actual sabotage or betrayal except by "splitting the party" or retiring a character. I suggest, though, that AP battles against one powerful individual aren't as interesting as battles against one powerful individual with adequate minions: for a dragon/whale scenario I recommend going with the (by the book) suggestion of statting the monster up as multiple individuals, like your average computer game boss monster of the bitmap era.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paulie" title="Paulie"><img alt="Paulie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paulie">Paulie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450293/#Comment_450293" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T08:08:34+00:00" title="January  4, 2016  8:08AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do not have the books at hand but mouseguard would seem to be a good fit.

Are we building a whale-hunting <i>game</i>, or just some whale-hunting systems for a game that includes other already-established things?  If the latter, please tell me the already-established things, so we can both avoid contravening them!<br/><br/>After that, I'd start from "what makes a fun whale-hunt", but we could also start from "what makes fun whale-hunter characters" if your inspirations run more in that direction.</blockquote>\nI know nothing about fun whale-hunts, but I can make some guesses based on fictional fights with dragons.  <br/><br/><b>Necessary conditions:</b><br/>- Whale exposed.  Where it normally resides, it's hard to get at.  Force/bait/enrage it into coming to where we can get at it.<br/>- Whale depleted.  Normally, this creature moves quickly and powerfully, and it's tough to do <i>anything</i> against it with any sort of precision.  Before we can hope to get in a kill shot, we need to weaken it and slow it down.  We could go for exhaustion, poison, blood loss, or something else.<br/>- Whale in vulnerable momentary position.  Sometimes you've got to shoot a big ol' creature in just the right spot, and you can't do that unless the right spot is facing you.  Unlike the two previous conditions, which will usually persist for a good chunk of time once achieved, this one could possibly be fleeting.<br/>- Clear!  Anyone who's obstructing the kill shot needs to get out of the way!<br/>- Steady!  The shooter's perch can't be shaking around enough to throw off the shot.<br/><br/>Those are the first 5 things which come to mind, and I think they imply several potential character skill sets.<br/><br/><b>Character skill sets:</b><br/>- monster behaviorist/psychologist<br/>- prey/bait -- run away from monster and tire it out without getting themselves caught and killed in the process<br/>- damage-dealers -- snipers, slashers, poisoners, etc.<br/>- rope expert to catch hold of the monster<br/>- strong people to yank the caught monster into the right position<br/>- master of pyrotechnics or other distractions/attention-getters<br/>- kill-shooter<br/>- fast or steady transportation for anyone else<br/>- danger-spotter and bailout for everyone else<br/>- first-aid for everyone else<br/><br/><b>Useful specific skills:</b><br/>- perceptive, insightful, knowledgable re: monster<br/>- fast, agile, deceptive<br/>- fearless<br/>- dexterous, perfect timing<br/>- strong<br/>- alert, great reflexes<br/>- weapon-trained, rope-trained, vehicle-trained, medic-trained, pyro(etc.)-trained                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450317/#Comment_450317" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T21:04:35+00:00" title="January  4, 2016  9:04PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome list!
