It's basically another type of threading, rather than regular threaded posts or chronologically linear posts. It could be handy for different things, but I'm thinking that that in itself would be the best moderator. I like how Andy doesn't have any explicit rules, just not messing with the zen. It works quite well, and I'm thinking Stack Exchange could have some potential for RPGs if run in the same fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326873/#Comment_326873" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-30T03:36:11+00:00" title="May 30, 2011  3:36AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's rather ironic that the mods seem to worry about the preponderance of 4e questions, while at the same time tending to mod the site so that it's much easier to ask a question that's useful for 4e than for many other games, although it is partly because of the SE ethos they've inherited.

That's about the right level of question for RPG Stack Exchange.<br/><br/>There's quite a lot of noise. The mods are odd, too: on a site that's ostensibly user-driven, they seem to think of themselves as hardline <i>moderators</i>. It's off-putting.<br/><br/>It's a shame. There is the potential for this site to be useful: really, there's nothing about the structure that makes it unsuited to indie games. And there's a tag system, so that you can ignore the D&amp;D stuff.<br/><br/>If the moderating team were better, I'd suggest colonising it and making it useful.

That's incidentally what sparked me to think about how exactly the site is run, and that it might actually be the mods contributing to the narrow focus rather than the users. If the users as a majority are mainly interested in d20 and 4e questions, not much you can do about it, but if the mods are driving away people with other types of questions and the userbase would actually like to ask them, then maybe things could change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326888/#Comment_326888" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-30T08:51:03+00:00" title="May 30, 2011  8:51AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was involved for about a week and then quickly lost interest.

In practice, once the D&amp;D edition wars took root, the atmosphere was going to be too toxic for the site to do well. There was this huge concern with having too many 4e questions on the site, but when you're trying to launch a new community, you need to be scrupulously careful about implying that some people aren't wanted. SE already has a strike against it insofar as it's not a discussion site and there's zero cultural context for an RPG-oriented site that's not about discussions. So you're going to piss off a certain amount of people that way no matter what you do. <br/><br/>So: it's totally reasonable to want more OSR questions or more storygame questions. But the thing that gets you more users is encouraging people to ask the kinds of questions you want asked, because that's additive. Once you phrase the problem as "we have too many questions about X," you're screwed. C'est la vie.<br/><br/>I am not entirely sure that it's practically possible to run an SE site about RPGs, though, because the discussion/question thing is a pretty huge cultural barrier.

When building an audience for your game, and when finding out what people do with your game, discussion is really really vital. <br/><br/>There's also a whole conversation to be had about whether or not the new SE model for creating new SE sites fundamentally works. The community chose moderators way before the community had any real idea how the SE paradigm might apply to RPGs. Also, given that SE has a small fetish about not communicating outside the boundaries of the SE framework, it's really hard for the community to reach consensus. SE worked because it was moderated, early on, by the people who built it and who had a strong social structure among themselves. Me and myx and Rob and C. Ross didn't have any real social fabric. (Which is why I quit moderating -- I was pretty sure that independent of my personal preferences, those three could form a consensus better than the three of them plus me could.)

I tried asking a few questions there, simply to support the site, but I know for sure that if I'd asked them at some more targeted forums I'd have had much more in depth answers much more quickly.

The problem is the diversity: the various sorts of gamers don't connect. Having D&amp;D gamers, Cthulhu gamers and indie gamers on the same site doesn't really work.<br/><br/>For example, look at the question <a href="http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/8170/how-do-you-keep-players-involved-between-their-turns" rel="nofollow">How do you keep players involved in between their turns?</a>. Note how the answers, which are geared towards 4E, wouldn't work in indie games at all. (I'm not complaining. There's no reason why they should: it's a D&amp;D question. But it's a good illustration of how different questions matter for different games.)<br/><br/>It works sometimes.

The meritocracy is interesting and a little weird to navigate (I didn't have enough reputation to make my own tags!), but For this sorta site I rather like it. Everything's filtered by how useful it as to the most people, and everything's pretty on point toward concrete answers, though the comments feature muddies things a bit.<br/><br/>Overall I feel like this could be useful, like Christopher said, for building up a database of answered questions, not to mention for raising awareness for games we like. The neat thing is that we have to (more or less, there are potential exploits, sure) raise awareness honestly, by answering or asking real concrete questions, not just posting about games in general to generate buzz. I intend to try it out for at least a while. The site will be what we make it, I think.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327199/#Comment_327199" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T23:40:46+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 11:40PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Can I suggest the<a href="http://www.quora.com/Roleplaying" rel="nofollow">Quora Roleplaying topic</a>?

I didn't realize the site is still in beta. My first few minutes were spent in meta, where I got a bit of petty pleasure up-voting comments and such that were in direct opposition to mod actions and opinions. After I got that out of my system (I ran out of votes) I went looking for some rpg questions to answer. The pickings were super slim for newer questions once I set my ignored tags on hide. I did up-vote a few good questions and answers and added an answer to one question. I'll probably go back through some of the older questions soon and see if I have any answers to add.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, I'm having a hard time seeing the value of the site when answers to such questions are a Google search away. At worst a post on one of the usual forums will get me answers, and a discussion of those answers if I want it. The primary value may be as just a reservoir of random rpg related stuff to read, sort of like mini blog posts. As a place where you go to ask or search for answers to specific questions, not so much.<br/><br/>The question asking aspect is mostly wasted on me, as my inclination is to first search to see if what I'm looking for has been answered elsewhere. It usually has been, repeatedly. That leaves me with asking questions to which I more or less know the answer already. Which is fine for building the database, possibly even necessary, but feels sort of counter to the spirit of the reputation system and all the little badges and such the site uses to try and reinforce certain behaviors.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm not quite sure if I'm not the intended audience by design or by popular vote.

The reputation system matters only so much as you can stand negativity. There was a level of meanness there (and maybe people thought I was mean, too; I'm not saying otherwise) that basically ensured that only people who could tolerate negativity stuck around for any length of time. Bickering, regardless of who is right or wrong, is generally not fun and who is gonna dedicate a ton of time to a site that isn't fun? The programming-related SE sites work because there's a certain professionalism inherent in the fact that people who post there mostly do so to support their living. (I spend a little time on SE programming sites, but not much, so maybe I'm totally wrong.)<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that as much as I cared about the site, I cared less and less as time went on because of the constant bickering. I realized that I was contributing to that bickering, if only for having a dissenting opinion, and it just wasn't worth a battle to me -- especially if RPGSE never manages to escape its perpetual Beta status. I'm pretty happy with my contributions to the site and I occasionally poke around still, but I don't consider myself an active member anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327432/#Comment_327432" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T20:35:45+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  8:35PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, we had no head bumping, but I have read some of the head bumping you're referring to and I thought it was a perfect highlighting of what is probably the sites biggest issue. Tell me if I'm off base here, I have no experience with the other stack exchange sites beyond what others have mentioned, but it looks to me like there is a culture clash between those espousing the existing culture/methodology of the core stack exchange programming sites and those who believe the site needs to expand beyond that to have more than marginal use. Beyond anything other than objectively measurable and answerable rules questions, anyway.<br/><br/>If that is what the site is actually intended to be, that's fine, but its not clear that is the case. With rpg play being closer to an art form than a science, not allowing for an expanded range of not only subjective questions but of questions that may even seem tangential at first glance is going to cut the site off at the legs. At least it looks that way to me. Maybe it could become the go-to site for D&amp;D rules stuff, but then its billing should really be much more narrow.<br/><br/>As others have said, the traditional stack exchange culture may just be a poor fit for a widely applicable rpg question and answer site.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327452/#Comment_327452" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T23:17:49+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 11:17PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think something else may be at play, and Ron Edwards' Fantasy Heart Breakers article applies. A lot of people only know D&amp;D, and maybe a few games around that. They've got a very narrow experience with what RPGs are, and questions applicable to different systems just don't seem to fit within that D&amp;D paradigm. Especially since 3e, and with the d20 boom, the game has been going the direction of something that a computer can handle, (which is appropriate for a programming focused site), but that rather excludes the much wider scope of RPGs that has developed since. If you've got Diamond Mods who don't know what they don't know, it's gonna be tough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327718/#Comment_327718" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T18:45:32+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  6:45PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were numerous issues that people bicker about there. If I wanted to bicker with people all the time, I could go read rpg.net or RPG Pundit, where many of the same arguments occur perennially. It just turns me off. <br/><br/>At the exact same time, the site requires its citizens to fight constantly for what they think is right and wrong, via the voting and reputation system. The problem is, there are a handful of sides to these ancient arguments, and reputation doesn't resolve it. There is enough voting on both sides to push up any issue's score. Nothing gets resolved.<br/><br/>Creating moderators and high-reputation users with special powers actually makes the situation worse, not better. Now you have seemingly "blessed" people with more power than others throwing their opinions around with more weight. I did it because, before I really thought about it, I thought that my reputation meant I had the will of the people. I just had the will of some of the people who agreed with me. <br/><br/>In the end, combining status and power games with my hobby, which is already prone to some ugly status games, just made it uglier. So I backed way the fuck off RPG SE and spent more time playing games on the tabletop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327719/#Comment_327719" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T18:49:04+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  6:49PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, vote ups count for more than vote downs.

Yeah, that should make me some kind of an authority...<br/><br/>I don't know if I should say this or not, but the anointed mods didn't get a lot of guidance from the guys running the site, either. On the other hand, we had this vague "be like a SE site should be" mandate hanging over our heads, and I think most of us felt like the success or the failure of the site was being determined by metrics we didn't fully understand. Chris mentions the tension between people who wanted the site to be more SE-like, and people who wanted to experiment. It was entirely unclear to me, as a moderator, whether or not the people paying for the site would continue to do so if we diverged too far from their desired model. And they aren't gamers of any pen and paper stripe, so it was difficult for them to really get the culture/context and make intelligent comments to us. Plus their mantra was self-organization; they didn't want to give us feedback. Which still perplexes me.<br/><br/>Probably the win would have been either the moderators saying "yeah, screw it, let's go rogue and see what happens."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
