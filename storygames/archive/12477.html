Thus, it's essentially a popularity contest. There's no committee of judges, no reviews, no criticisms or analyses, just votes.<br/><br/>ENnies are awarded annually. Only games published in the previous calendar (maybe +/- a few months) are eligible. <br/><br/>Thus they seemingly measure the groundswell of popularity over the last year.<br/><br/>But look at the "Best Game" category this year:<br/>Dragon Age:\u2008Set 1 (Green Ronin)<br/>Hero 6th Edition (Hero Games)<br/>Pathfinder (Paizo Publishing)<br/>Shadowrun \u2013 20th Anniversary Ed. (Catalyst Game Labs)<br/>Wild Talents 2nd Edition (Cubicle 7)<br/><br/>Only Dragon Age and Pathfinder* are actually new games. The other three are simply new editions. Shadowrun was published in 1989. Hero System was also first published in 1989. Wild Talents was published in 2006.<br/><br/>Allowing 20-year-old properties to participate in an annual award, puts newcomers at a huge disadvantage. Unless your game has a massive installed user base, you can't compete. <br/><br/>I like awards, but I think combining the popularity contest aspect with games that have been around for 20 or more years renders these awards irrelevant. We're not even looking at the most popular new game. We're looking at the most popular new edition. Have tabletop RPGs become so ossified that we just eagerly await retreads? NO! You're all well aware that there's a thriving community/industry/hobby all producing interesting material. The ENnnies structure sides with the big guys, the old guard, and lets them step in as they please to squat a fart on the efforts of other publishers. <br/><br/>I think some simple, common-sense rules for eligibility could render the awards incredibly relevant. But I doubt we'll see any change. It's fun to give Warhammer, Shadowrun and D&amp;D awards every year! Okay, that's not fair. There have been years when Green Ronin has deservedly swept the awards. But they weren't up against some of the biggest audiences in the hobby during those years. <br/><br/>Not that you asked, but thems are my thoughts.<br/><br/>-L<br/><br/>*And yes, even though Pathfinder is a retread of 3.5, I think it qualifies as a new system.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMcS" title="DanMcS"><img alt="DanMcS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMcS">DanMcS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280133/#Comment_280133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T13:07:06+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:07PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you complain last year when Mouse Guard got several awards, despite being a new version of your Burning games, and having your established fan base voting for it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280140/#Comment_280140" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T13:24:30+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:24PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2010 1:24PM by sage.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, worst case I think you could say BW is to Mouse Guard as 3.5 is to Pathfinder. Which Luke specifically calls out as being 'different enough.' I'd actually say Mouse Guard is even more different than that, but whatever.<br/><br/>Contrast that with, say, Shadowrun 20th Anniversary, which from what I can tell is a reprint (maybe with errata and some new art?) of a 4th edition which came out in 2005.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Luke, I'm with you, but I also kind of respect the Ennies for rewarding products that consumers like. A lot of consumers do just want a slight update of an existing game. As a community based award, I can see a lot of resistance to tightening the constraints on what's eligible. I bet a lot of people are excited to vote for their favorite game again. It's almost like the game designers have mind-controlled them, or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280145/#Comment_280145" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T13:39:30+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:39PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanMcS</cite>Did you complain last year when Mouse Guard got several awards, despite being a new version of your Burning games, and having your established fan base voting for it?</blockquote>\nDan, I didn't win any awards last year.

I've never played Hero, but I bet it's awesome, and I'm sure you put a lot of work into it. It does sound like a cool new edition, but at least one of the Best Game nominees appears to be an errata'ed reprinting of a 4 year-old edition of a 20 year old game (please correct me if I'm wrong on this). Given the precise 20 year number, I'd guess was picking on Shadowrun 20th Anniversary Edition too.<br/><br/>Especially when it comes to awards, I think it's easy for the indie community to come off as a little bitter. A lot of people here are sure that their stuff has been produced with just as much care as yours, but Hero 6 has the huge advantage of the Hero name. Ideally, everyone would have the time and money to play all the cool stuff that comes out each year, and it'd be an even playing field. Hopefully a little bit of discussion on the slant of the current playing field won't dissuade you from sticking around.<br/><br/><b>Luke</b>, I think for a lot of people those are, legitimately, what they think are the 'Best' games.

It's one of the reasons White Wolf remains a viable game company, because each new edition carefully protects the very-good-core of each of their games. When Vampire went from Revised Edition (third, really) to the "new" Vampire: the Requiem, they managed to keep what made Vampire good (and what made it Vampire), and that's an accomplishment worth recognizing.

("Hey, it was up for an ENnie."  "Did it win?"  "What, are you high?  It never had a chance.  But its description sounded pretty cool, and it was only like $10 on DriveThruRPG, so I got it.")<br/><br/>Like Luke Wheel points out, the way the ENnies are set up (judges pick nominees, the nominees are then put up to a public vote), newcomers and games with small audiences are pretty much never going to win.  I'm not sure that this is necessarily a bad thing, except in the sense that it may not be an award that should matter to people who are mostly interested in newcomers and games with small audiences; basically, if you need to see those games win something, you shouldn't be looking at any awards handed out on the basis of general voting.<br/><br/><br/>Really, it's like complaining about the Grammys.  You can say that a Grammy is meaningless and irrelevant (lord knows I say it, a lot), but what it really boils down to is this:  it is simply not the award I want it to be.  And that's not the same as being broken, although I'm happy to say that it is whenever I'm in a bad mood.  But more realistically, the Grammy Awards just are what they are, which is an award handed out to artists on major recording labels (who typically get radio play and get their sales logged in SoundScan); if the artists I like never even get nominated (the ones who aren't on labels and don't get on ClearChannel stations and who sell mp3s through their own website), that's just how the Grammy nomination process works.  It is not going to recognize the people I want to recognize, and as long as I don't confuse it with an award that <i>could</i> recognize the people I want to recognize, I don't feel any need to be upset by it.  There are a couple of local awards in my town that can go to a few of the musicians I want to see winning things, so I make do with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280171/#Comment_280171" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T14:43:16+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  2:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe just add a category to the voting, "Best New Game"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280178/#Comment_280178" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T14:56:38+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  2:56PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, so, yeah, making a new edition that doesn't screw up what the last edition did is something, sure.

Personally and professionally, I'd probably root harder for Psychic Muffin (or, in my actual case, Lucha Libre Hero, a real labor of love that sold about as well as you might expect a game about crazy Mexican wrestlers fighting zombies to sell even if it was a Hero product and is nominated for Best Supplement.) The actual awards are, as pointed out above, basically popularity contests, so I don't actually expect to win any of them, but I'd say 6th would have a better shot just because it sold better. If Psychic Muffin actually did win, it'd mean more people knew about it than I thought. Winning an Ennie once you've made it to the nomination is, in fact, mostly about existing popularity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe *nominations*, which come from a panel of judges I actually do respect, are a bigger deal to me creatively, so I'd be equally delighted that any of my "kids" got one of those. Which I guess was why I was testy about questioning our nomination- in theory, at least, that was based on quality, not sales, and the judges had equal access to everybody who sent in submissions. Several good small products did get noms- I'm particularly happy about How We Came To Live Here and Kerberos Club, myself, as I very much liked both books. Now, if a publisher/creator really couldn't hack even getting the submission in, well, IPR or somebody like that can help there. And maybe you can say that a complete unknown game faces an uphill battle even if it gets in front of the judges (maybe because actual playtesting time is limited, for example), but I know at least a few of them personally or by reputation, and I think they'd feel that any suggestion they didn't treat every submission equally would be unfair. dw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280202/#Comment_280202" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T16:56:06+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  4:56PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke, I think Darren's actually right about the nominations being more important than winning, as in the Diana Jones Awards, though the DJA are more important to me, personally, because I think they consistently point out some of the best stuff that's happening.

Walton has the right of it.  The best way to get the representation you feel is important is to support the judge that matches up best with your tastes.  It's not a guarantee that the products you want will get nominated (because the judges never know what they are going to see) but it's a good way to make sure your opinions are reflected.  Read over the judge's pages and pick whichever one you match up best with.  I've said it before on other forums but I think voting for the right candidate is far more important than convincing you to vote for me.  I'm sorry that there is some heartburn over the selections we made this year, but every product we nominated has a reason for being on that list.  Hero, Earthdawn, Shadowrun, BASH UE.. there are a list of games that are revisions or remakes, but we look at the product in its newest incarnation and decide, for better or worse, where that product stands.<br/><br/>To address another comment: Yes, innovation matters but just because something is unique and innovative does not make it good.  It does bump it to the top of my "read now!" list though <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Brand new mechanics and structures are taken into account, and if they work out well in play then they might earn the product some bonus points with a lot of us over a product that simply refines an existing mechanic.  Really that is up to the individual, how much they let innovation affect their judgment, but that's why selecting the right people to make those calls is important.<br/><br/>I'm sorry there is some heartburn over the nominations this year but I stand behind every product that received a nomination.  There are reasons for everything on that list to be there, even if those reasons are not readily apparent, and the decision making came down to a razor thin line between what was nominated and what wasn't in nearly every case.  If you disagree with those choices, please read over the judges' pages for the 2011 ENnies and vote for one of us that you think will handle the product the way you want to see it handled.  All of the judges from this year are running again so the 2010 nominations can be used to weigh us against all the other candidates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280214/#Comment_280214" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T17:36:28+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  5:36PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>mass-market retread games</blockquote>\nSomeone's advocating for Monopoly?

To force the two to compete does a disservice to RPG fandom all around.<br/><br/>I think that RPG fans are smart enough to distinguish between "Holy Hannah, an awesome new edition!" and "Sweet Jesu, where did this new cool thing come from!" I think rejiggering the categories to represent Best New Edition, Best New Game would enhance the credibility and integrity of the awards. Obviously, new editions are part of RPG life. They're not going to stop coming any time soon. Neither are new games.

Faery's Tale, despite being an innovative game and beautiful book, simply could not hold its own when faced with the publishing big boys. It was nominated, but didn't even get 2nd place in either of the categories it was nominated in. But you know what? Even being nominated was a "win." That's the way I see it.<br/><br/>The only bad publicity is no publicity at all. Working in the game industry and baving no one give a rat's ass about your work equals being a true loser. Be happy with whatever you can get of the market and fans, and try to grow on that. In a decade or two, your next edition might be the one that everyone is trying to beat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280250/#Comment_280250" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T22:28:15+00:00" title="July 12, 2010 10:28PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a Best New Edition category could be very robust.

It's a function of our industry and the nature of RPGs, where you can have a game engine and then build different games around it.  If Smallville gets nominated next year, is that simply a new version of the Cortex system, or a new game?<br/><br/>I'd say the inclusion of BASH UE is a pretty major victory for small press games.  That game is about as independent as you can get.  In general, small press games have been getting a better and better representation at the Indies.  A real effort is being made to reach out beyond the confines of ENWorld and it has paid off.  But change like this takes time.  Compare the nominees this year and last to even 3 years ago.<br/><br/>There is some serious entitlement going on here that is kind of unpleasant.

Nothing skews a statistic like giving the voting power to a mass of people who don't have the opportunity to at least read every entry.<br/><br/>I think there should be a limit on how old a game can be before it's disallowed, but it should be longer than a year. It takes even the best games some time to build up a real following, so I don't see why games up to three or five years old shouldn't be allowed. If you're going to let the public vote for a winner, they should have a reasonable chance of having seen a copy, right? And naturally, new editions of old games ought to be entered. Preferably they should be significantly different from previous editions, but what can you do?<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280281/#Comment_280281" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T07:06:23+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  7:06AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

But Paizo's Advanced Players Guide Playtest somehow made it on the list. <br/><br/>I love Paizo. Many of my friends work for them. I just bought their Gamemastery book.

The Academy Awards don't allow the new Bluray version of Wizard of Oz in the Best Picture category. <br/><br/>The fact that Shadowrun is on there is a travesty. Maybe they should add it for every print run? I mean, the copyright year is probably changing, right? That's a new product.<br/><br/>That said, with judges come judging bias. See: "The Dark Knight". I don't want to see all hippie indie games because they're "important", even if that's what I personally like.<br/><br/>If we do a "Best New Game", what's going in Best Game? First edition redbox? I mean, once you pick "Best Game" once, you'll sort of be forced to pick it every year until something better comes along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

A game can be far more than rules. It can include setting, fiction and art, to name three others. Yes, you can make a game that is pretty much just rules and no, there's nothing wrong with that. However, this is one category in the Ennies that I do like because it emphasises the importance of the mechanics over other possible issues. For example, Doctor Who. I'm not criticising it, it's a great game and deserves to be considered for Best Product, but the rules could have had a bit more kick to them. They serve their purpose, and the order of combat initiative favouring people talking their way out of problems is a definite plus, but they're not especially exciting or innovative either. Compare to Diaspora, which has no media connections, little official setting, but some really excellent use of elegant mechanics. Definately a contender for a rules-related award, I think.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher" title="Christopher"><img alt="Christopher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher">Christopher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280325/#Comment_280325" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T08:47:15+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  8:47AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I agree with Ash.

The existence of one does not negate the other.  Also, I was not directing my complaint at you specifically but to a general tone among several posters here (and really, there are a ton of thoughtful non-whiny posts as well, so I was being a bit emotional myself in my post).  But to be specific here, is what bothers me about some of the posts in this thread that take them beyond simply being constructive criticism and into the realm of whininess and entitlement:<br/><br/>1) An ignorance, deliberate or not, of history: you have to take into account where the ENnies came from and how they have evolved and are still evolving.  Threads like these are part of that evolutionary process, but they will be much more effective if they take into account the bigger picture.<br/><br/>2) An ignorance, deliberate or not, that the judges are real people and gamers who have worked really hard in a valid process to come to their conclusions.  I'm not saying this to elicit sympathy, but to point out that criticism is often erroneous if you don't know the people and the process.  It's the same for you designers when a gamer complains about this rule or that rule, thinking you deliberately fucked them when you actually playtested the crap out of that rule and deliberated for hours about whether to keep it or not.  Over at the Haven, for instance, one user was quite unhappy about the exclusion of Chronica Feudalis and saw it as a gross oversight.  Turns out the judge's looked really closely at that game and there was one rule in there that didn't quite work for them and because of that it didn't quite make the cut.

Regardless, I think the ENnies -- especially in light of their current status as the Gen Con awards ceremony -- are borkened. And I think they can be easily fixed by better recognizing how RPGs are actually designed and published.<br/><br/>Adjust the categories to separate out new editions.<br/>And if the judges' approval is so valuable, make a Judges' Circle. Let the judges nominate and AWARD a set of awards separate from the other categories. Balancing popular vote against critical acclaim can only be a good thing.<br/><br/>EDIT: They essentially did this for Dread. The judges loved the game, but they knew it wasn't going to win in the popular vote, so they created a special category and gave it an award for Innovation. They did it for Goodman games that year, too.

They are really redundant categories. Maybe "Best Rules" really means "The game with the most innovative rules, but not necessarily the best game overall"? But they (ENnies judges) don't say that, and I don't think that's what they mean.

As an example, let's say you have Best Free Product and Best Web Enhancement.  You get lots of Free Products (say 15, well over the 10 or so that you need to properly fill the category), but you only get 3 Web Enhancements.  Do you throw out the Web Enancements you did get, thus not allowing them to compete, or do you find another similar category (like Free Product) to place them in?  The Web Enhancements are free afterall.  Also, don't forget that the publishers that entered Web Enhancements entered them (read: paid the entry fee) with the expectation that they'd compete with similar products (keeping the disclaimer about how categories can be shifted around as needed).  <br/><br/>This is one way the number of entries can have an impact on categories.

Put another way, I think the nominations are more complimentary than who wins, at the ENnies, if only because it is easier to tell what a nomination is trying to say about the nominees. <i>Why</i> a vote is cast for a particular product can be vexing to contemplate.

How do you measure fun? What are rules for, exactly?<br/><br/>First:  I've no affiliation with these, or any awards.  This was just my attempt to interpret the difference between Best Rules and Best Game.<br/><br/>Second:  Fun is entirely subjective, yes.  But then again, so are these awards, as far as I can tell.  They're not awarding most sales, or anything like that.  In my mind, as a consumer, a good game is fun.  So I chose to interpret "Best Game" as the game that's the most fun, in the opinion of the award's voters.  How would you measure "Best Game" ?<br/><br/>Third:  I think that the rules of a game, and the presentation of said rules, are two different things.  I can see a "Best Rules" award recognizing a game whose rules clearly, unambiguously, and enthusiastically explain how to play a game.  That doesn't mean that the game being explained is any good.  On the other hand, a game with rules that are ambiguous, or just dry and boring, may yet turn out to be great fun to play once you figure out what the rules are trying to say.  <br/><br/>So yeah, I can see a reasonable (in my view) explanation for having the two different awards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280532/#Comment_280532" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T21:59:03+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  9:59PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2010 10:00PM by Hans_c-o.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: daw65</cite><br/>Third:  I think that the rules of a game, and the presentation of said rules, are two different things.

You either involve the community that is passionate about the product under consideration or you don't. Some people have talked earlier in the thread about music awards, while I usually make the comparison to non-gamers of the ENnies being "like the Oscars... only the judges are elected by the gaming community, they prepare the nominations list but then the community gets to vote on it." I often wonder, like every year, who'd win the Oscars if movie-goers had any input whatsoever.<br/><br/>Given both the talent and the tools available to those who do not have game production as their 'day-job' I prefer to look at TYPE of product rather than who produced it. <br/><br/>The comments about 'rules' versus 'games' are of particular interest. Are the rule mechanics the sum total of what makes a game? Or are they just the means for ensuring orderly task resolution in the background while the gaming group develops its shared story in their alternate reality? I think that's why it is valid to have both 'Best Rules' and 'Best Game' categories. Rules are, she says with her mathematician head on, modelling. You use them to abstract and model what is happening - even if it only ever happens in your imagination, in an alternate reality not in the 'real world.' Take, say, picking a lock. Lots of people actually are capable of accomplishing that task. Not all of those who want their character in a game to do so can actually pick a lock themselves, so you need a way to model that within the game - hence rules. Now that's a small and mechanical part serving as illustration, and it becomes harder when you are modelling something that doesn't happen in real life - try as I might I don't levitate, but some of my mage characters are quite proficient in the art! But compare different rulesets: some empower gritty realism while others enable epic and cinematic styles. Both - and more - have their place, depending on what you are trying to do with that particular game. The ruleset, however, is a tool provided by the game's authors to make that game function, there is more to a game than that.<br/><br/>Hey, this thread's making me think. I like that.

You don't either involve the commuinity or divorce yourself from them, there are many ways in which the community can be involved and it's important to distinguish which ways are valid and which may introduce unfair bias. Taking just the Ennies as an example, one method of inclusion is in the election of suitable judges, another is in the actual voting process. In my view, the former is valid and the latter is somewhat biased by the availability and existing fanbases attached to certain games. It becomes not a question of how good a game is, but of how many people have played it which is not necessarily the same thing. Judges are obliged to at least read and consider all of the options. Voters are under no such obligation.<br/><br/>It's one thing to say 'Look, do you want to be involved or not?' and another completely different thing to say 'HOW do you want to be involved?'<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280563/#Comment_280563" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T04:47:03+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  4:47AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2010 4:53AM by Graham.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Megan</cite>Fascinating discussion... especially once you start sifting out the good ideas for how the ENnies could be improved (i.e. constructive criticism) from the ranting, whining and "I just don't like the ENnies" bits <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nMegan, please don't be rude. One difficulty, with the Ennies, is that it's hard to have a discussion: if you complain, you're dismissed as whining; if you're friendly, nobody listens to your criticism.<br/><br/>Luke's point about an Internet popularity contest is a good one. Both the judges and the entry rules, I think, have parts to play in making things better.<br/><br/>The judges could be <i>very</i> selective about the nominations in one category. It probably wouldn't be Best Game: that, probably, will <i>always</i> be the category that rewards Shadowrun and Dragon Age. I can live with that. It's the Everyone Loves This award.<br/><br/>But Best Rules, say, could be used to spotlight innovative new games. So <i>don't</i> put Hero Games 6th edition in there, but <i>do</i> put Kagematsu and Montsegur 1244. You've started to do this already, I think, by putting Diaspora in there (that's a strange edge case, because it's FATE, which is an older rules system, but it's great).<br/><br/>But you can do more. Make sure games are up against games of a similar type. For example, <i>don't</i> put Lady Blackbird up against Paizo's Advanced Players Guide Playtest. I mean, seriously, guys. <br/><br/>I can't vote for a judge I want: anyone I'd vote for is banned from standing. But I do think the judges have a role to play in structuring the categories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C" title="Tom C"><img alt="Tom C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C">Tom C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280564/#Comment_280564" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T05:05:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  5:05AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2010 5:07AM by Tom C.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><cite>Posted By: Tom C</cite>In addition to the "second place=first loser" ENnie awards Mouse Guard received, it also won Best RPG 2009 at Origins,</blockquote>\nFeel free to start a thread about the Origins Awards, The Diana Jones Awards or the Indie RPG awards. I'd be happy to read your thoughts. This thread is about discussing the ENnies, though.<br/>Sure. My larger point (which I think is relevant but am happy to carry to a different thread) was that maybe the question isn't whether or not the ENnies or any other awards program is broken, but whether there's a need or purpose in having an awards/recognition process at all (a sentiment echoed by others in here as well). Sure, I've been pleased to see games that I like or have even worked on nominated, and even moreso to see them win. But at the same time, I'm cognizant of the fact (as I'm sure we all are or should be) that whether a particular game is nominated or not, or whether it wins or not, doesn't really diminish the game as game/creation/work of art/whatever in question, particularly when the process is so incredibly subjective, from the election/selection of the judges to their deliberations to the voting process itself. When the smoke and hype clears, the games remain, and those that win might see some buzz generated or a bump in sales -- certainly Dread did. <br/><br/>But if Dread wasn't nominated, or didn't win anything, it would still remain, hands-down, one of the best fucking games to ever be published.

It's about awards ceremonies judging on the content of the game <i>regardless </i>of how popular they are. It's about equality, not privilege.

It\u2019s exciting, and reinforces En World\u2019s positive qualities. But if the popularity contest aspect becomes a concern, there are existing models that address this without removing the people\u2019s voice. Several reality TV shows for example simply give 50% of the vote to the community and 50% of the vote to the judges. It would be fairly trivial to work out the logistics and it doesn\u2019t have to be a 50/50 split. It could be anything that the people in charge of the ENnies feel comfortable with. I\u2019m not saying this is the way to go or is even a major problem but if it is a concern there are easy answers which would maintain the spirit of the ENnies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280597/#Comment_280597" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T08:20:09+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  8:20AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2010 8:24AM by jenskot.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Skeld</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I've been reading the ENnies website and I think my expectations of the Free Product category were incorrect, rules as written. ...</blockquote>\nAnd some of that depends on the number of entries.  As an example, let's say you have Best Free Product and Best Web Enhancement.  You get lots of Free Products (say 15, well over the 10 or so that you need to properly fill the category), but you only get 3 Web Enhancements.  Do you throw out the Web Enancements you did get, thus not allowing them to compete, or do you find another similar category (like Free Product) to place them in?  The Web Enhancements are free afterall.  Also, don't forget that the publishers that entered Web Enhancements entered them (read: paid the entry fee) with the expectation that they'd compete with similar products (keeping the disclaimer about how categories can be shifted around as needed).<br/><br/>Thanks for replying Mark! And these are great questions. I don\u2019t have the answers but they are certainly worth discussing. <br/><br/>What do you do if you don\u2019t get enough entries for a category? <br/><br/>What negative impact, if any, does merging categories cause?<br/><br/>Why weren\u2019t more entries for a category submitted? <br/><br/>Are there any underlining causes?<br/><br/>It looks like Best Free Product started as its own category in 2001. Then became a dual category\u2026 Best Free Product or Web Enhancements. Then in 2006-2010 became just Best Free Product again but occasionally included web enhancements. Under the description a website can be included under Best Free Products. But Best Website is also its own category. <br/><br/>There is a huge list of Web Enhancements out there from design journals, accessories, maps, downloads, serialized content, and more. The content exists but isn\u2019t being submitted for some reason. The creators might just not know about it. Or the long history of merging Web Enhancements with Free Products may be confusing (although done for understandable reasons). I don\u2019t profess to know. And it just might be so low on the list of priorities it\u2019s not worth someone\u2019s time to investigate. It ultimately depends on the ENnies goals.<br/><br/>But Paizo\u2019s (again, a company I love) alpha playtest is not a Free Product nor is it a Web Enhancement. I don\u2019t know the history behind this but maybe it didn\u2019t fit anywhere else or Paizo paid to submit it so no one wanted to reject it. I have no idea. Normally it\u2019s not a big deal but given the nature of the voting system this one entry will likely win the category it doesn\u2019t actually fit in. That feels like a disservice to the other nominations. How do you have John Haper\u2019s labor of love and excellent free game that he essentially donated to the community and actually fits in the category go against something that doesn\u2019t fit in the category but has the strength of over 50,000 fans behind it in a popularity vote? <br/><br/>That said, it\u2019s easy for me to point to problems not being involved in the process. I know this isn\u2019t people\u2019s full time job and they have limited time and energy to work all these details out. I would rather have an imperfect ENnies (which can never please everyone nor should it) than have no ENnies at all. I appreciate everyone\u2019s work and I don\u2019t want my feelings above to confuse that. But my hope is that by discussing these details it will help improve the ENnies in the future. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280604/#Comment_280604" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T08:42:49+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  8:42AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite><br/>(Sigh) I don't think it's ever been about making awards ceremonies<i>favour</i>less popular games. It's about awards ceremonies judging on the content of the game<i>regardless</i>of how popular they are. It's about equality, not privilege.</blockquote>\nAnd that's exactly what happened this year.  Look, I've been one of the loudest people online screaming about the need for diversity in gaming and taking a shitload of heat for it in site's where that kind of talk is not welcome.  I've also been extremely critical of the ENnies on this issue for the past.  But I have seen significant improvement in the last two years, both in the way the program is managed and in the judges themselves.  I think the nominees this year reflect honest deliberation by the judges and not any extant bias or preference or general tendency towards better-known games.  I don't see how anyone can factually or logically argue otherwise beyond "why wasn't X nominated".  And in every case where that question has been posed, a judge has answered with both specific knowledge and experience (and often respect) for the game as well as a concrete reason why it didn't make the cut.<br/><br/>For the actual winners of each category, that part is largely a function of popularity (though again, not always) and that's the part that I accept as it is a fundamental part of the way the awards are structured.  I also see that part getting better as well, as our hobby moves slowly away from the single-producer market dominance situation (that last may be a bit of optimism on my part <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280606/#Comment_280606" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T08:45:05+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  8:45AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Well what if there were a special Design Prize, which was manned by a special group of published industry designers</blockquote>\nYou mean the Diana Jones Awards?<br/><br/>No, I don't.

All judges must:<br/><br/>    * be at least 18 years of age as of August 6th, 2010 and able to enter into a legal contract;<br/>    * not have any professional relationship with any RPG publisher during the period from <b>January 1st, 2009 to August 1st, 2011</b>. Such relationships include unpaid work and work on free products;<br/>    * declare any relationship with any publisher (including EN Publishing, except for the Ceramic DM line) in which they receive money, product, or special consideration in exchange for their services;<br/>    * be able to read English and communicate clearly therein.<br/><br/>If you have a relationship with a publisher, even as a playtester, it is important that you notify the ENnies board of this so that they may determine whether you are eligible to seek a judge position.  In  cases of rule violation, conflict of interest, misrepresentation, or other factor(s) detrimental to the awards, the Board of Directors retains the right to alter the composition of the judging panel at any time.<br/><br/>What that is saying is that if you have publishing experience, and there is one candidate who does have it, then you are not automatically ruled out.  This is similar to the confusion in another thread where people thought all playtesters were automatically disqualified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280630/#Comment_280630" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T10:03:57+00:00" title="July 14, 2010 10:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kinetic</cite>* not have any professional relationship with any RPG publisher during the period from<b>January 1st, 2009 to August 1st, 2011</b>.

The Ennies say: we must be independent of publishers! The Indie Games crowd say: anyone can be a publisher!<br/><br/>There's no way to square that circle.\n<blockquote>I understand the difficulty for people coming from such an active community, but at the same time there is a real reason for this rule that is the obvious potential for conflict of interest.

One of the reasons we were given was that people didn't want to go back and vote for judges a week after voting for product. This year, after voting for product, a person will then be given the option of immediately voting for judges. Hopefully, that will encourage more participation in voting for judges. Of course, even if they don't choose to vote at that time, they can always come back and vote for judges later.<br/><br/>As for the number of votes, there is no set number. The five judge nominees who receive the most votes will be judges for the next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280647/#Comment_280647" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T11:14:31+00:00" title="July 14, 2010 11:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tony.

Take miniatures for example: if there aren't enough miniature products submitted, there probably won't be a Best miniature Product category and what miniature products are submitted would likely get moved to Best Aid/Accessory.  Something like that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite> What negative impact, if any, does merging categories cause? </blockquote>\nThe main potential problem I could see is if products from the collapsed category don't have a good place to go.  That could lead to a category having two sets of disparate products.  Like with the above example, it would be harder to compare/contrast the qualities of two different GM screens than a GM screen and a miniature.  They're both aids/accesories, but there serve two very different functions.  It would just result in a complicating factor.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite> Why weren\u2019t more entries for a category submitted? </blockquote>\nI think you mean this is more of a rhetorical question.  Each year I've followed the ENnies prior to becoming officially involved, the submissions seem to have shifted around from year-to-year.  This is probably do to intra-market trends and/or feedback from new/existing products (for example, the launch of a major product like D&amp;D 4e).  unfortunately, we (the judges) don't really have any control over what gets submitted; that's strictly up to the publishers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite> Are there any underlining causes?</blockquote>\nThat's a great question (again, I assume you're being rhetorical here) to which I have no real answer.  I'm sure there are plenty of opinions though.  My guess is that there are publishers that don't think they'll see any return (recognition) on their investment (shipping 6 copies of product to the ENnies/judge, or paying the e-submission fee).  <br/><br/>Thanks for asking.  hope that helps.<br/><br/>-Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skeld" title="Skeld"><img alt="Skeld" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skeld">Skeld</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280763/#Comment_280763" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T21:51:21+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  9:51PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>I haven't given up.

Of course, it would be a function of next year's submissions, and business side of the ENnies would also have to agree (keep in mind that a new category means new medals/trophies/doo-dads or whatever they hand out, but not necessarily more money since the number of submissions probably won't increase accordingly).

Like, first you click all the ones you've ever played. Then it asks you to rate them in several dimensions. Answers are weighted nonlinearly by popularity, and the dimensions determine what category it wins.<br/><br/>[Edit: ... weighted nonlinearly but <em>inversely</em>. That is, if you're one of a million people saying, "I like D&amp;D", then that has less of an impact than if you're one in a hundred saying, "I like Fiasco". If you're one of three, say, your vote is downweighted just like if you're one of a thousand, and if you're the only guy, then you're like one guy in 10,000.]<br/><br/>I kinda doubt the ENnies folks want that, though.

I was confused that I apparently don't play small press games, despite playing and reviewing them for years...<br/><br/>Christopher my apologies, I didn't mean to insinuate anything about the games you've played. I simply went through the Judge Applications and listed judges who answered...<br/><br/>"7. What games have you played in the past year? List up to 10 RPGs you have played the most."<br/><br/>...with indy games I'm familiar with. That's all. <br/><br/>With a few exceptions, I'm not familiar with the games you've reviewed. I would have had no idea that you reviewed all the games walkerp listed above from simply reading the application. And with 20+ possible judges to vote for, there isn't a lot of time to do research on every one. <br/><br/>That said, I voted for you just because of your excellent answer to... "6.

(either legitimately through fan votes, or just a higher population of people IP-spamming the vote box).<br/><b>Premise, Cont A:</b> "Changing some of the categories/adding a category or two would totally correct the problems I see with the awards."<br/><b>Premise, Cont B:</b> "The votes are a popularity contest."<br/><br/>(note, on the side: "*": It's not that "Game X 3RD Edition" has a better chance of winning against "Our" (Indie/Story-focused/Hippie/Hyperfocused/whatever) games, but against All New Games, regardless of where it came from)<br/><br/><b>Response, Focusing on Premise Cont B:</b> "Instead of requesting the awards get fixed, look at the judging process: The method in which judges are chosen is fair**. The method in which the judges choose the games is fair**. The popularity contest that ensues is largely based on the decisions of those judges, which again is a fair process.**"<br/>(note: "**": I believe that the judging process IS fair)<br/><br/><b>Rescponse, Conclusion:</b> <b>Therefore, we should focus on staying within the (imo broken) system, spam-voting for the judges that are halfway in our pockets and will pick indie games!!</b><br/><br/><b><i>That's just disturbing.</i></b> (IMO)<br/><br/>I'm all for making use of an irrevocably broken system, "playing the game" when there are no alternatives and no hope of changing the system. This is much the same way in which I address and play (successfully!) the NY stock market, for example.<br/><br/><b>Andy's Conclusion:</b> But these are the ennie awards, not say "a government" or "a company". Can we not presume that if we find whomever is responsible for the system, that we could perhaps suggest to them that next year  they think about some categories that are fair to all new games: "Best New Game", "Best New Edition" (incidentally JD totally sold me on that idea, I think it's great)). Things like "Best New Game" and "Best New Edition" would bring ALL games, not just "indie" games, to a platform where they can more evenly compete with games that have been around in some form for 5, 10, 20 years. The "popularity contest" will continue, but I think more people (Luke included) would find it a "more fair" or at the very least "more interesting" popularity contest.<br/><br/>For an enterprise as small and perceptibly changeable as the Ennie Awards, I am far more in favor of:<br/><b><span style="color: #0066FF;">1* Shouting loud enough to get heard on the issue of New Game vs New Edition, until "an internal vote" (or whatever the process the Ennies need to add/change awards) is called.</span></b><br/>than<br/><b><span style="color: #0066FF;">2* Stuffing the ballot box of judges who like My Life With Master, who will vote for "us"/vote for "our games", instead of looking to fix the actual problem we perceive.</span></b><br/>The former fixes the awards in general, and would prop up more awesome new games outside of this little community that we would never otherwise have heard of. The latter just props up the paragons within our little community for yet another Nomination.<br/><br/>In the end, if "1" is an impossibility, I'd rather simply ignore the judging/voting process than engage in 2, which feels unclean and ultimately futile. I'd rather sit on my fucking hands than use them to stuff ballot boxes with "insiders".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281292/#Comment_281292" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T12:13:51+00:00" title="July 17, 2010 12:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I don't think the judges have ever really been the problem.

Each judge chose one single game that they liked, but felt was underrepresented among the other nominations.  It is my belief that they will become a regular part of the awards again, but you'd have to ask Tony, the new manager to be sure.

People look at Best Rules, or Best Game and there's no way to tell from just those name exactly what the judges mean or how they differentiate between them.  To get that you have to dig around on the ENnies page or search for threads like this one where the judges have a better ability to explain their decisions.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't know that there's an easy fix to this.  You can't exactly go around calling each award by names like 'Best Individual Rule or System that Provides Consistent and Clear Direction for Play, and/or Adds an Innovative or New Approach to Play'.  If they were all that long we'd have to sit through another hour of that damned ceremony.<br/><br/>The judges have clear direction on what belongs in each category, rules to follow for what to select, but also have a lot of room available for personal interpretation.  Perhaps the biggest failure isn't in the categories themselves, but in the difficulty for people on the outside to see what those guidelines are.  In future years it also might make for a good series of questions to ask the candidates that pop up everywhere: What do you think  Best [insert favorite category here] means, and how would you judge it?<br/><br/>I don't see what Luke is saying here as sour grapes - Mouse Guard wasn't the first game he entered or had nominated, we nominated Burning Empires the first year I was a judge - I think it's a suggestion coming from someone who's trying to provide some context as to where he's coming from.<br/><br/>The awards aren't perfect, but I think they try hard every year to fix the problems people have, and I think that a lot of what are seen as problems are really from a lack of understanding (that, of itself, IS a problem).   If people don't complain then no one knows what needs to change.  Similar complaints have lead to the creation and rearranging of categories a lot in the last few years, and asking for what you want is really the only good way to get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281418/#Comment_281418" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T07:53:48+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  7:53AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Master of the Game</cite>The judges have clear direction on what belongs in each category, rules to follow for what to select,</blockquote>\nIs that public information?

Sadly a lot of this comes from guidance from management along the way, so there's no one single place to get to it, but I'd be glad to post my thoughts when I get a bit more time, and I think it's definitely something that could be brought to Tony's attention as a goal for the coming year.<br/><br/>There's some information about this on my <a href="http://enniejudge.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, but I'm not going to ask for anyone to go back and search through three years of posts looking for it.  I'll post something more comprehensive later tonight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281421/#Comment_281421" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T08:14:38+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  8:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The ENnies website has improved a lot, but it still needs a total navigation overhaul.

The judges (as evinced by Jeremy's blog and the many judges responding here) are really trying hard to improve transparency, with the blessing of the ENnies organization, which is a big, positive change from years past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281423/#Comment_281423" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T08:23:20+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  8:23AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

However, many Indie game writers know very well if they're going to be submitted or not because the authors are the only people who are going to make such a submission. I mean, I publish all of my stuff through Lulu, they aren't going to send out free copies to the judges and I don't think there's any way a product can be considered without it being sent in by somebody. barring some weird mysterious benefactor, there's no way my stuff is going to get nominated for anything.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281528/#Comment_281528" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T19:52:39+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  7:52PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.
