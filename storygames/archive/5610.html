Newman's blog, he writes:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>I showed up at the Forge booth in 2004 with Under the Bed. There were, if I recall, 31 other games for sale there. I sold 40-some copies of UtB, a quirky little game about toys and children that had a funny way of making adults cry. That\u2019s the year The Mountain Witch came out. It sold 92 copies. Last year, the Forge/IPR booth had over 100 games for sale. I believe the top seller sold 40-some copies. I don\u2019t remember who that was or what their game was, but I have no doubt that it sold a lot because it was good. I\u2019ll say that louder: The best-marketed, best-designed, best-sold game sold fewer than half as many copies as the top sellers in the two previous years.</blockquote>\nInteresting! So this makes me wonder. I'm going to GenCon for the first time this August, and I'm looking to be part of the Forge Booth. Thing. Area.<br/><br/>And my question is, if my game's going to be a year old by the time GenCon's rolled around, and it's sold maybe a hundred copies already, and it's not exactly an indie-indie-hippie-indie-kinda game, and it's not exactly d20 either, what am I looking at? Ten, fifteen copies? Twenty? I know for a fact that my game isn't the "best-marketed, best-designed, best-sold game". My game's claim to fame is that it employs profanity the likes of which I have never seen in any other RPG. That's what I have going for me. I use the f-word as punctuation. That's a bullet point in my marketing copy. <br/><br/>So, seriously, is it a waste of time to bring more than a couple dozen copies?<br/><br/>Are there any other data points to be aware of? Sales figures on the rise, or the decline? Issues with getting your games to the convention area? Issues with getting leftover copies back home?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125591/#Comment_125591" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T13:59:36+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  1:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In 2006, when Cold City was just out, I sold 53 copies on the Forge/IPR booth.

In 2007 I sold, like, 10 copies total, or something like that.  If you haven't been at GenCon before or if your game hasn't gotten a lot of exposure, 50 copies is not uncommon.  And if your game is either 1) really grabby, which I think yours is, or 2) backed by a lot of buzz or a well-known game designer, or 3) demos really well, you could potentially sell a bunch more... like Mountain Witch (grabby, unknown, demos well) or Burning Empires (grabby, buzz, demo'd like crazy) or Hero's Banner (not that grabby, unknown, but demo'd like crazy by Tim Koppang).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125758/#Comment_125758" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T09:14:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  9:14AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A strong 15-minute demo sells games.
