For clarity, I have highlighted in blue one of the voices. I have added her name, at her request.</span><br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2018....What\u2019s the best way to go about making sure that everyone\u2019s being heard and respected and that there there aren\u2019t triggers going on when you\u2019re gaming in a mixed group?\u2019<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">ELIZABETH SHOEMAKER SAMPAT: \u201cI was in a really offensive game of Fiasco, the Dreamation before last, and honestly, what I ended up doing was, after character, I mean, this was before, this was after, I think, the first two scenes, it was already really, really offensive. Somebody made this horrible stereotype of a mail-order Chinese bride in the western playset and was literally just babbling fake Chinese.\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u2018ugh.\u2019<br/>\u2018ugh.\u2019<br/>\u2018yuck.\u2019<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cIt was so incredibly cringeworthy. And, I just ended up leaving because everybody else seemed like they were really into this, and it was a convention and honestly at conventions there\u2019s more than one game you can play.\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u2018Right.\u2019<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cAnd I always thought, you know, if this ever happens to me-- I\u2019ll sit down and have a mature conversation with the person who is offending me.  But cons are too short. Instead of being confrontational, for me, I would much rather, you know, say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to go use the bathroom\u2019 and then go and find other cool people to hang out with. I know that\u2019s the coward\u2019s way out,</span><br/><br/>\u2018No!\u2019<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;"> \u201cBut I\u2019m very conflict averse.\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u2018No, I think that that\u2019s something that, I mean, I engage pretty actively as a feminist online, on Twitter, I blog. I\u2019m into all that.  And one thing that I\u2019ve sort of experienced, and that it\u2019s taught me, is that you really need to be aware of what taking care of yourself requires.  And if engaging with people and trying to tell them what they\u2019re doing is so awful, isn\u2019t going to be good for you, then don\u2019t do it. Just remove yourself from that situation.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Right.\u2019<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cYeah, it\u2019s easier online. But, face to face I\u2019d much rather just duck out and then complain on the internet later\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u2018Well, yeah, I think\u2014\u2018<br/><br/>laughter<br/><br/>\u2018That\u2019s totally a valid strategy.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Yeah I mean, obviously, I wouldn\u2019t say you do that with your friends.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Right.  Not with your friends.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Right.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018But you\u2019re never going to see these people again.  And you\u2019re probably not going to make any difference, anyway.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018One of the tactics that I kinda try to use, sometimes, um, and, uh, you guys can\u2014uhh\u2014 [cough] you ladies\u2014 can, uh, correct me on, or fill in the details. But, it was a thing that feminists were doing in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s and maybe even a little bit after that\u2014 but just kind of the concerned frown.  Of, basically, if someone says something, you kind of frown and look at them like \u2018Hunh, that was kind of a terrible thing to say.\u2019  You don\u2019t bring it up or anything like that you just kinda, \u2018Hunh. I didn\u2019t realize that you were capable of saying things like that. That\u2019s a little disappointing.\u201d  And, then, that\u2019s it!<br/><br/>\u2018I do that unconsciously anyway.  That\u2019s just a thing I do.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018I\u2019m pretty mouthy.  I\u2019ll probably, I mean, I haven\u2019t run into this problem yet.  And I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll react, but I will probably get mouthy with somebody.  Just because that\u2019s sort of my nature. And I don\u2019t mind investing in making someone understand why I\u2019m walking away.  I mean I think that it\u2019s one of those things where everyone sort of tactically goes along with it if no one calls it out. And that\u2019s bullshit.  In certain situations I will just walk away because I don\u2019t want to give these people any of my energy. They don\u2019t need to take any more than they have. But I\u2019m just guessing that I\u2019ll probably end up being a loudmouth, if people do that at the next con I go to. I\u2019m just imagining. It also influences what cons I go to.  I try and figure out what cons I go to.  I try to figure out who\u2019s throwing them and what the general feeling is behind it before I give them my money.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018I wanted to chime in on that briefly. It seems like it\u2019s sort of a good jumping off point for the Penny Arcade Dickwolves scandal.  And PAX.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Yeah.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Oh yeah.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Yeah....\u2019<br/><br/><br/><span style="color: #009900;">For purposes of comparison, the following will be a transcript from an actual play recording-- of the same Fiasco game session described above.<br/><br/>Post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2312&amp;Mode=like">#12</a> is also transcribed from that session.<br/><br/>Post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2336&amp;Mode=like">#36</a> best explains my reasons for creating this thread.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327817/#Comment_327817" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T12:36:14+00:00" title="June  5, 2011 12:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2011 11:30PM by Todd_L.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #FF0000;">EDIT: The following is an actual transcript of the first couple minutes of the same six-player game session described above.  I was surprised at how exculpatory it is.</span><br/><br/><br/>\u201cWhat is Fiasco?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s all about, basically, the relationships between everybody and watching everything going to hell. Very quickly.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCan I ask a quick question?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to this con before, much less played this game. What is the expected MPAA rating for what we do around here?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, that\u2019s up to you guys. There, I mean, we have to decide. There\u2019s the lines and veils conversation. The lines are something that people don\u2019t want to see happen. That doesn\u2019t happen at all. A lot of times that\u2019s something like rape, abuse of children. That just gets knocked right off. Or veils are something that can be mentioned, but it doesn\u2019t happen on-camera. So it\u2019s no real detail on it. That\u2019s actually good that you asked.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDo you have a preference?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI really like film noir and Coen brothers movies, so uh, I would say the full monty.  But, that\u2019s me. And I am more than willing to, uh.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cBut, there\u2019s things I don\u2019t think they would do in their movies.\u201d<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cRight, yeah.\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u201cWell, maybe not THEIR movies, but, there\u2019s some Russian noir that, uh...\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to need the dice...d6\u2019s more than anything.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh yeah, it uses the black and white d6\u2019s.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWe have more than five players, I am just going to facilitate, occasionally throw in an idea for somebody else.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cSo, \u2018soft R\u2019, maybe?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cyeah!\u201d<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cyeah, um-hum.\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u201cYeah, if there\u2019s anything specifically that somebody goes \u2018I don\u2019t to want to have that line drawn\u2019, still please speak up.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019ve never hit anything, off the top of my head. But.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIf something comes up in the middle of the game that you\u2019re not comfortable with, just point that out.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYeah.\u201d<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cNo, like, stabbing puppies.\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u201cOk. We\u2019ll avoid stabbing puppies.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYeah.\u201d<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014 were you going to play a professional puppy stabber?\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u201cI thought I could.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019ve developed a Call of Cthulhu-style game.\u201d [based on Scooby-Do]<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">\u201cAaaah.\u201d</span><br/><br/>\u2018So.

The game was hewing pretty closely to pulp pirate tropes, so a non-serious voodoo priestess character was not especially unexpected, but I was still a little worried because unflattering portrayal of a marginalized religion (voodoo), even in a game context, made me a little uncomfortable. I realized I didn't want to shut someone's idea down directly ("that character can't be in the game"), so instead I took a more active approach: I rolled a voodoo priest character, and played him very close to a realistic portrayal of a Haitian houngan. By acting through him, I was able to act out a positive view of voodoo practitioners, introduce elements of the story which fit accurately with voodoo theology, and oppose the wicked voodoo priestess as a cultural appropriator and co-opter of righteous religion. The characters actually had a really evocative and engaging rivalry, and I was ultimately happy with the story in terms of how we portrayed voodoo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327856/#Comment_327856" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T18:11:22+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  6:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think there is a definitive way to avoid triggers. For 2 reasons...<br/><br/>1. It's often unclear what will be a trigger. First, there are many triggers for many negative experiences that we may not even be aware of. Second, something doesn't have to be explicit or obvious to be a trigger. I have many friends, male and female, that have been raped. For a few of them, explicit rape in game isn't their only trigger. For one, any kidnapping triggered rape since they were raped after they were kidnapped. For another, religion was a trigger since they were raped by a priest. For another, something as unobvious as physical contact one one's shoulder's was a trigger. You don't know what will be a trigger and often it's too complex to discuss in a lines and veil conversation. <br/><br/>2. Even sensitive, educated, multicultural people use stereotypes. I have friends who are feminist minorities and spent many years working with anti-racist activist groups that unintentionally roleplayed poor stereotypes in games. I have one friend who helped teach seminars in how to avoid problematic stereotypes in writing... and used them without thinking when we roleplayed. <br/><br/>Then what do you do? <br/><br/>1. I suggest giving people the option to censor content in game, for any reason, no questions asked. If something makes you uncomfortable, says so, it's gone. It helps to make it clear this is an option by codifying it. I've played with the idea of using an index card that says "censor" on it. <br/><br/>2. Instead of asking, "what don't we want in our game", it might be more effective to start with a list of common sensitive subjects and ask, "which of these are we ok with in our game?" You can have a list that includes: violence, violence against children, violence against animals, sex, rape, cursing, sexism, racism, PC death, and so on. Additionally, someone can say, "I'm ok with X but only if Y." For example, "I'm ok with sex as long as it is off screen or I'm ok with cursing as long as you don't say fagot."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327860/#Comment_327860" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T18:34:12+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  6:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2011 6:36PM by Andy.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See my thoughts, below:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>Post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is an excerpt from a recent episode of the Walking Eye podcast, which I believe you're familiar with.</blockquote>\nAhhh, ok.

How could it have been avoided?<br/><br/>...questions around that sort of thing.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Personally, I hope you do the latter, as I too am interested in the exact moment leading up to the player leaving the table, and the conversation that happened before/around that. But again, this isn't a Courtroom of Story Games Society, there's no room to prove yourself here. Let's focus on the solid questions that emerged from that experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327861/#Comment_327861" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T18:37:41+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  6:37PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2011 2:50AM by Todd_L.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, <br/><br/>It was transcribed from an actual play recording by me.  <br/><br/>Pretty close to an exact transcript, but with "uh" often rendered as a comma, and sentences that end in "y'know" often rendered as a period.<br/><br/>An em-dash flush right indicates ellipses in post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2312&amp;Mode=like">#12</a>.  The ellipses haven't glossed over any incriminating bits.  Just non-controversial parts.<br/><br/>Me? I'm the moron who says "Cock Swallow????" when somebody said 'Hog's Wallow.'  Failure to hear things correctly was an actual problem in the noisy hallway, but I riffed on it for comic effect.  I was declared legally deaf several years ago, before surgery.   I named the character Xie Xie.  I lived in Chinatown for 14 years, often getting by saying Xie Xie and nothing-else.  I was silently opposed-to making Xie Xie a drag queen or prostitute, and she was not narrated as either clich\xe9.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, the sole female player was in the game longer than the two turns she approximated in her account-- it was actually a whole go-round of the table.  She stuck it out for an hour.  I had thought she was just there for two turns, also.<br/><br/>She did not actually say \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to go use the bathroom\u2019 and not return.  The facilitator-guy called the bathroom break, and she never came back.  We spent 18 minutes waiting for her, asked other women to check the bathroom to see if she was ok, looked all-around for her friends.  Wondered whether it would be inconsiderate to continue without her, gave up.  I never knew why she really left, but knew that she had a low opinion of the con attendees from her openly saying the folks back home were much cooler. That sounds awful, but that doesn't mean she wasn't right.<br/><br/> I've seen her several times since, but she's never mentioned the game.  <br/><br/>Every time I see her, I worry whether she quit because I equipped my guy with a Wanted poster of her character, Brick, but reading "Brock Van Shitenhaus".    As I recall, she was firm that it wasn't her guy's name.  And I agreed, but insisted that my guy had been duped into believing that it was Brick's name-- and was constantly being directed to the outhouse while making inquiries.<br/><br/>Despite sophomoric crap like that, the game is was one of the best Fiascos I've played.  In the end, Xie Xie the mail-order bride turned out to be a mastermind a la Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, playing the PCs against each other and absconding with the bandit's loot as well as the deed to dirty- Old Man Peabody's ranch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327872/#Comment_327872" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T19:05:45+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  7:05PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>...or simply engage in a dialogue with the folks who were at the session (including the woman from the podcast)...</blockquote>\nUh-- I don't think it's a good idea to pursue a woman who I now know for sure has literally fled my presence, until directly I'm invited to.<br/><br/>I also empathize with, and respect, her aversion to direct interpersonal conflict.

I learned more Chinese than Xie Xie just to interact with others during that 2-hour period, in the 30 minute car ride to SF.<br/>Aside: Check out the classic Doctor Who episode "Talons of Wing-Chiang" to see Tom Baker jump over a table to punch a 'Chinaman while yelling out the war cry "NI HAO MA!"*<br/><br/>So yeah, I'll say it: <b>SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS SOME SERIOUS CULTURAL DUMB THERE, BRO</b>.<br/><br/>Hopefully it ended with the lame name, and not any "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zulEMWj3sVA" rel="nofollow">Ching Chong Ting Tong Ling Long!"</a>... hopefully?

The paper fan is a questionable stereotype, for anyone who doesn't want to give him the benefit of the doubt.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">shreyas</span> Elizabeth</cite>. I think the final straw was the guy with the mail-order bride selling her to the creepy letch.</blockquote>\nYour firsthand account differs quite a bit from mine.<br/><br/>I'll offer my account.  Not in the spirit of "I'm right and you are wrong", but just to show how differently we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">characterize</span> the same event.     According to me:<br/><br/> <span style="color: #009900;">Detective Butch went into the Hotel with the Bride, hoping to ditch her there, so he could travel alone to raid the hideout where your bandit Brick was holed-up with El Baldy.<br/><br/>Old Man Peabody was in the hotel lobby, twirling the corner of his eyebrow (akin to how Snidely Whiplash would twirl the corner of his moustache), and saying "Excellent", (a la Mr. Burns), when he saw the Bride.<br/><br/>When Butch tried to arrange a hotel room for the Bride, Old Man Peabody intervened and offered to board her at his ranch for free.  The hotel Concierge warned that Peabody seemed unsavory.  Butch said the Bride couldn't afford to turn Peabody down, since her money to pay for a hotel room was scant.   The Concierge said the hotel had other women staying upstairs-- who earned their keep, implying a brothel.   Butch said he thought she'd have better odds of fending-for-herself against Old Man Peabody; and sent her away with Peabody.<br/><br/>As Butch, Concierge, and Peabody arranged her fate right in front of her (as-if she wasn't even there), the Bride became agitated and tried to speak for herself; but none of the men spoke Chinese.  Butch responded with condescenscion, by saying something along the lines of 'There, there little lady. You just calm down, and let the menfolk handle this.'     <br/><br/>The initial burst of protest from the Bride was portrayed by a male player in roughly as many syllables as a Chinese exhortation in Firefly.  And it's just barely-possible, to me, that the player was indeed quoting a line from Firefly, or some actual Chinese.  By that I mean, he wasn't literally saying the syllables Ching, Chong, Ting and Tong.  On the other hand, I -suspect- he was saying nonsense syllables.<br/><br/>After being patronized by Butch, the player switched to Spanish to indicate that the Bride was now grumbling, unhappy about having been ignored.   The entire foreign language content was 3 to 4 sentences.<br/><br/>After you left, at Peabody's ranch-- Peabody was confident that the Bride didn't speak English.  So he chattered away, bragging about his criminal plans involving mineral rights.  It's possible those plans involved trading her to somebody.  And it's possible, back when you were still at the table, the player had previously announced that his guy would be trying to trade her to somebody.   <br/><br/>At some point the Bride smashed something over Peabody's head and killed him.  Turned out she was a mastermind who knew English all along, so she executed Peabody's scheme herself.   I don't recall whether she let herself be married to him first, so that she would be his heir.<br/></span><br/><br/>So:  I would not have characterized the game as including a scene with 'the guy with the mail-order bride selling her to the creepy letch'.     <br/><br/>But I do feel you are entitled to your characterization!<br/><br/>I feel <b>anyone who wasn't there</b> is making a mistake, if they convince themselves they know with certainty what happened.<br/><br/>Even the transcript or the audio recording is no substitute for having been there.   It may add a degree of  credence to one side or the other, but anyone who wasn't there simply can't ever REALLY know what actually happened.   They're just guessing.<br/><br/>That's why I don't like hearing people who weren't there-- using this session as their poster child for racism, sexism, ching-chonging, anything.    If they weren't there, they're actually using a made-up example from their own imagination-- not citing an actual real world things that definitely happened.  <b>I'm talking about you, Chris Chinn: <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/ching-chongery/" rel="nofollow">http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/ching-chongery/</a></b><br/><br/>So, for now, I hesitate to post the recording online or further transcripts.  I think such evidence would give a false sense of surety about 'what happened'.     <br/><br/>If this were, say, a courtroom trial where some Harm (in the legal sense) had been done-- then it might be necessary to pick apart the available evidence Beyond A Reasonable Doubt.<br/><br/>But I don't wish to put myself, Elizabeth, or the other players on trial in the mob-rule court of public opinion.  <br/><br/>Nor do I think it was right-- the way this game has been used as evidence to put the entire populace of straight white male con-going gamers (who presumably also smell and live in their mother's basement) on trial, in absentia, by proxy*.<br/><br/><span style="color: #009900;">*<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=583" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=583</a></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328166/#Comment_328166" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T07:42:50+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  7:42AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>None of what you said after the first two paragraphs is relevant, because that's when I chose to leave. I think it's cool the game turned out to be one of your favorites. Fantastic! You would not have enjoyed it nearly as much if I were there bringing down your fun. I was made uncomfortable by what happened in the first part of the game, and I left.</p>\n<p>As to putting the white male straight gamers on trial, I find your accusation absurd: you and I have had conversations IN PERSON where you have expressed dismay over what you see as the constant attack against white, heterosexual "typical nerds" on Story Games and I have told you that I have much love for them. If it weren't for straight white males I wouldn't have gotten into gaming (and, of course, I would not even exist). You know I have much love for SWM gamers.</p>\n<p>What happened in the podcast that you seem to be missing is that someone asked me what I would do if I were uncomfortable in a game played with strangers, so I told them about the time I was uncomfortable in a game I played with strangers. That's it, man. Nothing about how all white dudes are evil, nothing even about how this particular group of dudes was evil, just a game where I was made uncomfortable by the content.</p>\n<p>Some guy from the game found me later and asked me where I'd gone. I told him I couldn't handle the portrayal of the Chinese character and left. He said she ended up getting revenge and killing the dude, and it was clear that in his mind that justified the beginning. He kept telling me how it got better after I left. That's great! That's fine. But she could have become the goddamned president of the united states whose open-minded bisexual daughter killed Hitler and I would have still been grossed out by the beginning of the game.</p>\n<p>I think you keep using this transcript as evidence but don't want to post the audio file because you know it sounds fucked up. It's fine if that's your kind of fun, but why do you have to villainize me if it's not my kind of fun?

The way I read this, you guys (Todd and Elizabeth) actually agree on the stuff you've communicated directly about.  The dissonance has come from a huge amount of text obscuring what's important to whom.<br/><br/><b>Step 1:</b> You guys were at the same Fiasco game.  There was some iffy content.  One player spoke fake Chinese.  Todd didn't find the fake Chinese cringe-worthy.  Elizabeth did, and didn't feel comfortable confronting the offending player, so she left.  She didn't alert the other players, so they spent a while wondering what had happened before resuming play.<br/><br/><b>Step 2:</b> <i>Walking Eye</i> invites Elizabeth to a podcast on various topics, including offensiveness in gaming.  Elizabeth cites the fake Chinese from the Fiasco game and how she responded.  Todd has no problem with anything in Elizabeth's recounting; she tells it like it happened, and is fair.<br/><br/><b>Step 3:</b> The other <i>Walking Eye</i> participants respond to Elizabeth in such a way that drives Todd nuts.  Todd doesn't see a discussion about fake Chinese at cons, he sees a stereotype being evoked (Mom's Basement Gamer) and reviled based partly on a misunderstanding of what occurred in play.  One unspecified dude making a poor choice in portrayal becomes an opportunity to bash a swath of white male gamers as mail-order-bride-exploiting social retards who deserve no courtesy.  Or at least Todd is worried that that's what's happening.  <br/><br/><b>Step 4:</b> Todd wonders if the ire he sees in the podcast is actually founded.  He'd feel bad if he contributed to offensive play!  He doesn't think he did, but now he wants to go listen to the recording to prove it.  He listens, and the recording affirms his interpretation.  He's still irritated by the <i>Walking Eye</i> podcast.  So he starts this thread to show how the responses he heard in the podcast are out of synch with the reality of play.  Elizabeth's words are used to demonstrate this out-of-synchness.<br/><br/><b>Step 5:</b> As someone whose words are being used to demonstrate a gap between perception and reality, Elizabeth worries that Todd is blaming her.  Todd is mostly blaming the other podcasters, and holds nothing against Elizabeth, but does remain somewhat bummed about her role in giving the other podcasters fodder to misinterpret.  This thread progresses accordingly.<br/><br/>Does that sound accurate to both of you?<br/><br/>Todd, if you're not burned out on this topic, I think inviting Tori and the other podcast participants to a discussion about over-assumption and/or vilifying MomsBasementGuy might be interesting.  Hopefully the thread here on S-G about roleplaying characters whose language you don't speak is serving to address the fake Chinese issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328277/#Comment_328277" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T15:00:11+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  3:00PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Step 3 is where it loses me, based on this thread. There is nothing anywhere in the podcast transcript that suggests anything remotely like this. Elizabeth is the only one who even talks about the event -- the conversation then immediately turns to more generalized strategies. There isn't a single comment about this person being a 'type' or even representative of a cultural problem (though that is clearly a larger premise of the conversation, it is never directly applied to Elizabeth's story.)<br/><br/>At which point Step 4 and 5 become kind of bizarro-world. Todd blaming anyone for anything doesn't make any sense when there isn't actually anything to blame anyone for. I think it's still interesting to see how he had a different perception of the events, but unless I am missing some huge conversation elsewhere in which this story is held up as a demonizing example of White Stereotype Gamer Dudes or something... I don't get it. Because it's not in that transcript, that's for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328293/#Comment_328293" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T15:46:47+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  3:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 4:04PM by Andy.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey David, Ice Cream Emporer: Again, I don't want to make this the public jury or whatever to make judgements or comments on what must have actually happened. I put my own chain of events in my head, but stating them in public is just going to draw more comments, discussion etc around this whole event like someone's on trial and we'll resolve right and wrong right here; so I'm asking everyone to do the same. That we'll get to the bottom of it in public like a TV drama courtroom. This isn't the place for us to "sort it all out".<br/><br/>I like the idea of playing peacemaker as much as the next guy, but let's do that in private if at all. Todd and Elizabeth can sort this out amongst themselves in private (email, blog, etc) as well if that's what they wish.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Todd, if you're not burned out on this topic, I think inviting Tori and the other podcast participants to a discussion about over-assumption and/or vilifying MomsBasementGuy might be interesting.</blockquote>\nSounds like a good idea if he wishes to, and if they are willing to on their own terms. Not up to us to prod them to do it any further than that light suggestion there, of course.<br/><br/>Personally, I have no interest in the defense of the neckbeard/MomsBasementGuy stereotype, but if that's interesting to someone else, perhaps they can carry that discussion on elsewhere.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328312/#Comment_328312" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T16:58:41+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  4:58PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 5:11PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough, I guess that shoulda been a whisper (or two, as the case may be).

I've chatted with Todd on the phone about his take on this, and it was a lot easier for me to grok what the issues were from that than from reading this thread.  <br/><br/>But I'm sure I didn't do a perfect job representing him (or Elizabeth) here anyway.
