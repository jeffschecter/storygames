I was hoping to get some ideas, suggestions or words of warning from you folks. Sorry about the \u201cbrain dump\u201d quality of the post, I\u2019m returning from a long and mentally exhausting hiatus, trying to get my brain back into a more creative design space.<br/><br/>My idea so far is an Exploration circle divided into 3 sections; Terrain, Life and Climate. When the players first view a region of a planet, write down 2-3 major, defining terrain or climate features of that region; stuff that would be visible from orbit. For each feature, write down if it is Dangerous, Valuable or Beautiful and why. A feature can be more than one of those things (Dangerous and Beautiful), but each feature must be at least one of those three. Also, there should be at least one feature that is Valuable in some way. The Dangerous features are ones that can come into play when the GM makes a Move.<br/><br/>As the players explore, introduce new features, such as wildlife, weather or local terrain features of interest. The new features have a strong relation to one or two of the existing features that have been noted previously in the Exploration circle. If the planet has lots of sharp spires, what kind of odd weather would that produce? What kind of flora would grow in the gaps between the spires, or hang off them? What animals would live there? And remember to note why they are Dangerous, Valuable or Beautiful.<br/><br/>Look for connections, for reasons why, and draw lines between features. Eventually you\u2019ll have an ecological web of threats and rewards that you can call upon.<br/><br/>Note on Valuable:<br/>I\u2019m tinkering with Valuable as the way to entice the players to risk life and limb actually going down onto the planet and crossing all the Dangerous stuff. To take a page from Civ, Valuable resources are likely to fall into Production, Luxury or Scientific; having two different Valuable features (but no room for both) might even put player archetypes at odds.<br/><br/>(With all its probes and unmanned rovers and space ships and scanners, it feels like sci-fi exploration of alien landscapes lacks a lot of challenge. It\u2019s like trying to do a dungeon crawl with level 30 wizards who can fly, walk through walls, see the future and have greater elemental servants. Gotta figure out SOME way of getting their hands dirty)<br/><br/>So yeah, maybe it's too complicated? I want to give that feeling of discovery and exploration and unknown, but in a way that has a bit of structure and guidelines. If anyone knows of nicely done alien landscape exploration, I'd be happy to take a look.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439856/#Comment_439856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-02T23:00:35+00:00" title="November  2, 2014 11:00PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You would have to come up with a compelling reason to get people to explore a location. It's a problem people have had to deal with in star trek games. <br/><br/>Figure out the reward and you got a game. Are they hired to get information about worlds? Do they get a finders fee for discovering new life forms? Maybe they have to find sentient life, or do first contact with new races for some patron. Maybe companies pay for samples of new plants and minerals. <br/><br/>Also not every explorer is going to be well funded. Don't start the players out with a full sensor suite, maybe they only have two broken down probes that require them to go down and retrieve them from time to time. Or maybe the sensors are not broad spectrum only picking up some information, so it requires players to go down and do readings by hand. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439860/#Comment_439860" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-03T09:02:22+00:00" title="November  3, 2014  9:02AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this is conceited to mention under the "nicely done exploration" category as I made it, but whatever, it's what I know.<br/>I'm going to share what I made for the explore-y bit of my own sci-fi ApW hack, The Shining Void. Some of the differences between the two games cause it to lack everything you're looking for, but as your project inspired mine I hope you might glean something from it.<br/><br/><i>Survey A New Planet<br/>When you touch down on a new planet, ask who's been there the most before. That character rolls +Experienced (a stat corresponding to cautiousness, determination, and callousness). On a 7 or greater, the MC will ask questions from the following list, and the player answers as they wish. On a 10 or greater, the MC asks 3 questions. On a 7, 8, or 9, 2 questions. On a 6 or less, the rolling player asks 2 and the MC gets to answer however they wish.<br/>* What civilization has dominated the planet? Or is it wild?<br/>* What's the most dangerous creature to watch out for?<br/>* What crisis is currently shaking the planet?<br/>* What sort of special equipment is needed to explore the planet?<br/>* What is the climate and what does the landscape look like (in the area you land in)?<br/>If no character's been to the planet before, ask who's idea is was to come here, and that character rolls, but 1 fewer question is asked regardless of result. If it was assigned, perhaps as part of a mission, assume it to be the commander's idea.</i><br/><br/>My game comes with reasons to go to worlds as a given, so the move is concerned with establishing the state of the world rather than its value. The questions themselves are slanted towards my game's action focus (rather than a primary exploration focus), with options about the locals, crises, and dangers, but there's no reason they need to be.<br/>UW's stat line doesn't have anything quite corresponding to how I use Experienced, but I wouldn't rule out Ingenuity (or even Tech if sensors are the main method of getting info).<br/><br/>The purpose of the move is to establish a scene and a situation for immediate play once setting down, not for discovering why the world would be a good place to go. It serves to split up the authority on who gets to talk about the situation - the unanswered questions are the ones that the deprived parties (players who couldn't answer or the MC if it was a hit) seek to fill in themselves, but don't get definitive answers until seen in play. It also interacts with a mostly-explored space, even if the players have never been there before.<br/><br/>So what I have is intended for a single instance rather than as an ongoing exploration event, but is simpler. I don't know if it's what you want, but hopefully it gives you some ideas or something. I love exploration in games and really want a game that does a great job with it, so good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439869/#Comment_439869" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-03T20:29:08+00:00" title="November  3, 2014  8:29PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2014 8:29PM by BeePeeGee.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can imagine this very well as a <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/" rel="nofollow">Microscope RPG</a> session. You would not only explore the terrain geographically, but also put the discoveries in a (vast) timeframe, i.e. from the first discovery until the establishment of civilized colonies (or extinction of all life on the terrain).<br/>It's mechanics should play very well by themselves or combined with your ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
