                    So, there's a lot of interesting discussion going on around the net on satire, identity, and just a general, "What should we do? How should we conduct ourselves?" vibe. <br/><br/>So, I was just wondering, all side discussion aside, if there's one (and only one!) piece of Jargon that you think really explained some stuff to you and hard, I want to know, the following, in this format:<br/><br/><b>1) The Word/Phrase/Jargon<br/>2) What You Think it Means<br/>3) Why it is your Favorite/How it helped you/etc</b><br/><br/>Now, I just wanted to lay a ground rule for this thread: If you think someone is Wrong on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> ("OH, actually your word means something more like X...") either <b>keep it to yourself</b>, or <b>take the discussion to Whisper or A New Thread</b>.                </div>

                            1) The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast<br/><br/>2) It identified that the conventional wisdom, variously expressed as something like "The players control their characters, the game master controls everything else," was a useless piece of information that ignored the inherent logical flaw therein (i.e. that it's impossible to grant the game master "total control over the story/world" while simultaneously at a given point allowing a player "total control over his character" -- something's gotta give in each moment-to-moment decision, and either GM or player is in control at a given momemnt, not both).<br/><br/>3) The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast helped me specifically, consciously identify why I was not having fun in games. It was because the GM (sometimes me, sometimes not me in actual play) was basically assuming the authority of moment-to-moment decisions without question, recognition or cause. Illusionism -- a play style in which the GM essentially fools his/her players into thinking they are making significant causal decisions -- is one solution to the Impossible Thing Before Breakfast. But, in my opinion, it's a terribly un-fun one. Recognizing this was important to me.                        </div>

                            Mine is pretty lame, and entirely "Technical":<br/><br/>1) "Fortune in the Middle"<br/><br/>2) It describes how in most games, you start to say what you are doing, then you roll the dice to see what happens, then you narrate the outcome (success or failure) from there. With Fortune in the Middle, though, you basically Roll the dice beforehand, and based on the results describe from there what happens from scratch; and usually the SYSTEM either supports it or it doesn't.<br/>In other words, instead of<br/>"I shoot him, I'm rolling my Agility and Shooting. ROLL. PASS. I shot him and hit for X damage".<br/>or<br/>"I shoot him, I'm rolling my Agility and Shooting. ROLL. FAIL. I miss him".<br/>Fortune in the Middle is:<br/>"I want to get past this guy, I'm rolling a bunch of dice. OK, the red die in this game symbolizes violence and that's high; a success. The white die in this game symbolizes social contact, and that's low. I guess that means that I pull my gun and shoot him."<br/>or<br/>"I want to get past this guy, I'm rolling 10 dice: Clatterclatter. I get 1,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,6,6. I take all the 4s, 5s and 6es and put them in "Effective", which gives me 31, a success. Then I take all the 1s and 3s and put them in "Pain", which is a 10, a failure. I guess that means I try to talk my way past the guy, and I succeed... but in the process somehow he catches on to me and causes me pain, perhaps he alerts the guards in the building?" (he roleplays this encounter out with the GM and the other characters, and the continue to the next challenge).<br/><br/>3) It's my favorite these days because it's a new way to think about something small like rolling dice and declaring actions.  It also helped me deal a little with the whiff factor in normal games: In many cases, for example a "seduction roll", I will have the players roleplay it out, and provide bonuses or whatever, and most of the time I'll handwave the roll if the roleplaying is awesome, or roll anyway when failure is just as interesting as success (and the player seems cool with it). <br/>But in situations where we're not sure WHAT we want to do, but we're sure which ability or skill we want to use to DO it, some Fortune in the Middle tricks/knowledge have helped me as a GM on the table.  Like, a player will want to roll for persuasion, but is momentarily at a loss for what to say roleplay-wise. Penalty? Hells no, I'll have them simply roll the dice for the character, see how good or bad their success was, and change the reality of the situation accordingly.<br/>Like, say if a player is stymied when trying to use persuade to get past a bouncer in a bar. Using Fortune in the Middle Tricks, you can really do some cool scene-altering stuff without having the dice give off bizarre results like they might if you were roleplaying/describing first.<br/>Ex:<br/>Normal: "I want to get by this bouncer.", at which point a whole discussion starts with the GM "in character".  Say the GM really hams it up, pushes it to a situation where it doesn't look like he's getting in, and the player rolls his Social "to hit" roll, and gets a Critical Success? It might be kinda weird to change the narration mid-stream while still keeping up the pace/stride of the conversation.<br/><br/>Fortune-in-the-Middle: "I want to get by this bouncer... Hmmm." GM asks, "Wanna just roll it first this time?" Player says, "Sure", and rolls. Critical Success.  The Player and the GM start roleplaying, and the GM portrays his bouncer from the Get-Go as a nervous man, or dumb, or a friend ("Hey, Rich! Is, that YOU? Long time no see!"), whatever it takes to give meaning to that critical success without "backing up" or "retconning" the intermediary role-playing.<br/><br/>It's little tricks like those that Fortune-in-the-Middle really helped crystalize for me, and improve my GM skills for even totally traditional games. It also helped me as a GM really heap on the joy to make their characers look cool (if they wanted to) when they rolled high, without any intermediary weirdness or going "Oh, nevermind, yeah the Princess was totally being a bitch but now she's in love with you", etc.<br/><br/>Holy crap, that was friggin long.<br/><br/>OK, you don't have to be so wordy.  But if there's a piece of jargon you like, lay it on us.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            1) <b>The Monarda Law</b><br/><br/>2) Monarda is a cousin of "Say Yes or Roll the Dice" from <i>Dogs</i>, but <i>Nobilis</i> doesn't use dice. The Monarda Law is an instruction to the GM: "Never say No." To phrase it more positively, "Always say Yes, even if it's Yes, But."   In <i>Nobilis</i>, anything is possible, it's just a question of how difficult it is to perform. So if the players want to do X, no matter what X is, the answer is always "Yes." Additionally, I think Monarda also indicates that players shouldn't censor themselves or impede each other's powerful choices ("No, don't do that!" or "Wait, if I do that he'll probably kill me, huh?").  Sometimes, one could argue, you need someone to tell you an idea is lame, but Monarda is totally against this. Monarda is about the power of an imagination set free.<br/><br/>3) Monarda is critical, in my mind, to the culture of player empowerment that many games try to create. Some players are used to authoritarian GM control and having their ideas shot down, to the point that they're not used to offering up productive suggestions. Or people new to gaming or with more shy personalities may be unsure if their ideas are "good enough" or when it's appropriate to participate. Constant reinforcement and inclusion by always incorperating their suggestions directly into play does an amazing job of making it over these hurdles (for example: watch how often Luke says "Awesome!" during a BW demo). It also goes a long way towards freeing the imagination from only looking at things that 1) a character is likely to succeed at, mechanically, and 2) the GM or other players will definitely approve of. This makes it more likely that players will suggest something unusual or less obvious and, in my experience, more likely that play will go somewhere unexpected and interesting.  And that rocks.                        </div>

                            1) <strong>Situation</strong><br/><br/>2) The 'starting set' of fictional elements, juxtaposed in unstable relationships, with which the players are confronted and which the players address.  Ideally, the situation is built using flags, my runner-up for favorite jargon term, so that the players actually care about the situation.  Nevertheless, the real value of situation is that the creator of a situation has no (or very little) investment in how the situation is addressed, just that it <em>is</em> addressed.  This contrasts with plot, which is the development of a situation, and cannot be reliably planned in most RPGs.  Situations are <em>easy</em> to create, present, and implement, and they produce entertaining play.  Plots are hard to create, present, and implement, and lead to entertaining play unreliably.<br/><br/>3) Everything I learned about game design comes from <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em>.  Town Creation is awesome stuff, and is responsible for the majority of the awesome that comes out of that game, in my opinion.  Grasping the difference between pre-planning the characters finding the secret passage that gets them to the Big Bad and simply setting up NPCs doing stuff that the PCs will have a strong reaction to, has made my gaming lots less frustrating, lots easier, and lots more entertaining.                        </div>

<li>Over time I've found more and more that this is the lens through which I view design, both my own endeavors and in critiquing the work of others.

                            Not sure if this meets the thread's criteria, but here goes:<br/>
<br/>
1. Squick<br/>
<br/>
2. Content that crosses boundaries for a player or participant, because the material is so gross/creepy/disturbing/objectionable.<br/>
<br/>
3. I first ran across this term on the Forge.  I was actually kind of suprised.  As a gorehound, I had never encountered a situation in an RPG that went "too far".  However, I learned that there are a great many horror aficionados that don't particularly care for gore or extreme situations.  This was something of a revelation for me.  Also kind of a disappointment, but that's neither here nor there.  It got me thinking about the consensual story-creation, and how clearly-defined boundaries need to be created prior to play, particularly with regard to horror games (where the potential for squick is much higher than, say, medieval fantasy games).<br/>

                            Flags (Even though it was just done)<br/><br/>2. A flag is a way of making the game about what people actually want it to be about. It centers the story on the things players think will be awesome.<br/><br/>3. I despise most terminology, simply because I feel that labelling and classifying is much less productive than discussing and contrasting.<br/>But... Flags is a useful, concise term to describe a good idea.<br/>It's a term that DIRECTLY applies to Actual Play, and its one of the few terms thats use doesn't trip the conversation up in an argument about definitions.<br/>Plus, it sounds cool.                        </div>

                            1) Stance<br/>
<br/>
2) The various stances describe different ways a player can relate to his or her character.<br/>
<br/>
3) When I first started gaming, I tended to make gamepieces, not characters. This got especially bad when I was a 12-year-old Champions player - I paid no attention whatsoever to the character's identity, I just cared about combat effectiveness. Over time we all grew more interested and able to play characters as more than just collections of combat effectiveness, and in the process grew more and more focused on a poorly defined agenda, best approximated as "Immersion good." Hearing people talk about Actor/Author/Director stance in a value-neutral way instantly widened my understanding of how the hobby could be enjoyed.                        </div>

                            I'm going to cheat and do two.  The first is already established in our circle, the second is one that I've been meaning to write about.<br/><br/><br/>Term: Drift<br/><br/>Explanation: If a game's rules do not promote (or actively discourage), a group's goals for play, Drift is the process by which they alter the rules (via addition, subtraction, or change) to better suit their goals.<br/><br/>Why: Because it's awesome, and because it places rules-changers in a noble category: the actual game designers for much of RPG history.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Term: Lehman's Axiom of Interesting Play<br/><br/>Explanation: All things being equal, players will choose the option for their characters that they percieve as making the game more interesting for themselves or their fellow players.<br/><br/>Why: One, because it's named for me.  But the second is that it shows that we really are conscious of other people while we play, and concerned for the entertainment value of our gaming, regardless of paens to "immersion" whatever else.  Lastly, because it is the only piece of RPG theory I've seen that has actual experimental results (survey data from Finland.)                        </div>

                            Christian and Joe, totally. "Flags" is the only jargon my group uses; I introduced it and everyone took to it instantly. It's easily understandable, and a handy feedback tool, as in, "Dude, you totally missed hitting that flag!"<br/><br/>Jason Larke, I hear you. I started out (13 or 14, I think) playing Marvel Super-heroes like a boardgame, and it took me some time (and different games) to get me thinking about what these imaginary characters were thinking and feeling and saying.<br/><br/>OK, so mine:<br/><br/>1) Conflict resolution<br/><br/>2) Conflict Resolution is the technique of resolving what the character's actual goal is in a scene (as distinct from Task Resolution, which is resolving the success of actions, i.e. does this blow connect with its target? but not necessarily resolve whether the character achieves his goal). This is not synonymous with resolving an entire scene in one roll or what have you; it just means that any victory counts toward the goal of the character, not just the success of actions. For instance, "I fight the bad guy and save the princess, but maybe not kill the bad guy," vs. "I fight the bad guy and kill him, but maybe not save the princess." (where "save the princess" is the goal, of course.)<br/><br/>3) CR rocks the house because it puts its finger right on what I've always struggled with in RPGs: that what I really want out of a given situation may not necessarily be achievable by resolution of my character's actions. I've spent a long time in roleplaying feeling pretty ineffective (through my PC's ineffectiveness) and wondering why. Some of it was just lousy die rolls, and some of it my own inexpertness with a given system. But there was more to it, and CR shone the light on the problem. As <a href="http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">Vincent Baker</a> says, the GM can pretty much break the Success=Victory correlation at any point.<br/><br/>One thing I've come to realize, Conflict Resolution is nothing new; innovative systems have given it explicit rules support, but good and fair GMs have been doing it throughout the hobby's history, simply by rewarding success with victory. It's so, so fragile though: not only do you have the illusionist GM arranging for convenient villain escapes in spite of your hard-won effort in plowing through henchmen, but you have honest folks giving rulings based on what "makes sense," or befuddled GMs really having no idea (and possibly no desire to learn) how to match up the two conditions. So I've come to value the CR principle immensely, and even in games where it isn't explicitly coded in the rules, my desire is to make success and victory correlate as much as possible. (PArt of doing that is rolling dice only for what's important, but that's another tipic. . .)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS That Tigger thing is <i>awesome.</i> </div>

<p>1) text; as written</p>
<p>2) the words a game's book contains, also its art in some cases; following what is instructed in the text without deviance</p>
<p>3) The text, and play-as-written, give us a much stronger common ground to talk about games than we have if we try to discuss play where the rules in the text have been altered. So many rules discussions on rpgnet had frustrated me before I learned to pay attention to how the text was deviated from.</p>

                            1. Social Contract<br/><br/>2. It's the agreement (sometimes implicit) that players make about how they're going to play. And interact. And things. <br/><br/>3. Thinking about this concept helped me with organising LARPs at conventions. In the LARPs I run, half the players will usually be long-term LARPers, while the others will be on-the-day sign-ups. They'll all have different expectations of the game. But nobody wants to start the game with a <i>conversation</i> about how to play: they just want to play. So there's some sort of implicit social contract and, without going into details, considering that has helped me a lot.                        </div>

                            Awesome.<br/><br/>1)  IIEE.<br/><br/>2)  Standing for Intent, Initiation, Execution and Effect, this jargon term sets out what steps the <i>character</i> must go through when taking an action.  By breaking down that sequence, IIEE allows the <i>players</i> to better understand, and have better control over, the events in the games fiction.<br/><br/>3)  I love IIEE because it does for me exactly what I said above.  It gives me a much better way of communicating with players about our characters actions.  Also, it's a bit of jargon that I feel that I, personally, understand very well and am comfortable with.  Now if I could solidly wrap my head around FitM, I'd be solid on Conflict Resolution.<br/><br/>Note:  Social Contract was a very close second.                        </div>

                            1.) Creative Agenda<br/>
<br/>
2.) Put simply it is the answer to the question of "Why am I playing this game?"  Generally accepted to have three broad categories of answers; Gamism, Narrativism, and Simulationism.<br/>
<br/>
3.) For some unexplainable reason I had never actually asked myself the question of why I was engaging in role-playing games.  Once I did and could, with a little honest self-analysis, answer the question the fun parts of games started to make more sense.  This has allowed me to figure out why I find certain things fun and why I don't find other things fun.  I can avoid the un-fun and seek out specifically the fun activities.  20 minutes of fun packed into 4 hours of gaming is now a thing of the past.                        </div>

                            1. System Does Matter<br/><br/>2. The mechanics of the game inform and define the resuting play.<br/><br/>3. Because it helped me realize that you can't squeeze blood from a stone. It totally changed my perspective in evaluating both the systems themselves and the play they facilitated. "The play they facilitated" is even a phrase I would have never used before. For me, everything flowed from this.<br/><br/>Lack of understanding of this is also the main failing I see when discussing RPGs with most of the gamers I know, both online and off. I am right now, in a thread on ENWorld where the OP asked, "Why don't my players care about their character's background and personality quirks when making them? Why do they only care about their race and class?" I am currently failing to get across the idea that this is becuase D&amp;D, mechanically, doesn't really require them to, so why should one expect otherwise? General response: "Why do you need mechanics for this? The DM should just give XP for good roleplaying."                        </div>

                            This is the best.  <br/><br/>I've got two:<br/><br/><b>Thematic Premise.</b> <br/><br/>A gripping moral or human issue that confronts a character or is explicit in a given situation and that cannot be ignored. Having something that the players care about be central and at stake.<br/><br/>This is what helped me understand what distinguished narrativist play from non-narr, and convinced me that both 1) narr play was something I was interested in and 2) I'd been doing it all along, just by bumbling into it helter-skelter with no conscious intention and little to no help from the systems I'd been using.  Getting what thematic premise meant helped me make my final break with what I'd thought Simulationism meant, and learn that I could very well identify strongly with preferring RGFA simulationist techniques, while at the same time writing and playing narr games.  <br/><br/><b>Adversity</b><br/><br/>Opposition, Problems, or obstacles that are faced in-game.<br/><br/>Looking at this as a good thing, that makes play interesting, and that somebody has to provide helped unlock for me how rpgs function. It's a term that pretty much means what it says, little to no explanation needed. Folks understand it when you talk to them about it, and they can see why this would make a game fun.                        </div>

                            Rob,<br/><br/>Agreed.  Besides, we'd probably need a whole Glossary section, with each term it's own discussion, kept carefully on track by the original poster, and rules and rules and rules...<br/><br/>And that's not Story Games, I think.

                            Hey, I'll take that challenge.  As it happens, the 'No Myth' concept really struck a chord with me.<br/><br/>1.  <b>No Myth</b><br/><br/>2.  As the GM, you can make stuff up as you go, in response to player actions.  It advocates 'just-in-time' world building, based on the twin pillars of player input and genre conventions.<br/><br/>3.  I had wanted to run a 7th Sea campaign for some time, but while I had some ideas, I didn't have a 'plot'--you know, something with a beginning, middle, and end.  So I sat on my ideas for some two years and nothing happened.  Then a friend <a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~dans/rpg/no-myth.html" rel="nofollow">collected</a> a bunch of posts about it and suddenly something clicked for me.  "Hey," I thought, "If all I have is a beginning, I'll just use that, and make up the rest as I go."  And then when the game started, I didn't even end up using the beginning, but we all had fun anyway.  Something about the way 'bangs' are usually explained make me think they're all about 'take something the player loves and destroy it," or "make your players into angst potatoes", but 'No Myth' said to me, "Clap your hands and make your players jump, then draw in the terrain where they fall."  That sounded (and <a href="http://strackenz.spod-central.org/~lpsmith/rpg/transcripts/ussura/GMnotes.html" rel="nofollow">turned out to actually be</a>) a great deal of fun.                        </div>

<b>Fiction Suit</b><br/><br/>This comes from Grant Morrison's <i>The Invisibles</i>, and in our world (the roleplaying world, that is), it means "character that has a player". In <i>The Invisibles</i> comic it appears in several contexts, such as a writer that projects herself into her story, or the main character King Mob, which is a projection of Grant Morrison into his comic. Gaming has happily stolen cool color, magic and metaphysics from <i>The Invisibles</i>, but it's also perhaps the best discussion of roleplaying as a process I've read so far.<br/><br/>Why is this useful for me? I find it useful looking at characters we create and control in gaming as fiction suits (analogous to diving suits or space suits), as the apparatus we use to enter the fiction we are creating, to experience and participate in it. If you've played or read <i>The Whispering Vault</i>, you might find this reminiscent of the dreamers entering the world of the flesh. This is the fundamental act of gaming, what sets it apart from just designing a world or writing a story: we enter the fiction and interact with it "from the inside", while still being fully aware of our ability to manipulate it from outside. I find that this idea illuminates roleplaying for me, a single image that brings together on one hand the idea of creating narrative and exercising shared authorship and on the other hand the idea of immersion and having cathartic experiences in a safe environment.                        </div>
