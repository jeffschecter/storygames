Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.<br/><br/>2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.<br/><br/>3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.<br/><br/>4. Every sentence must do one of two things -- reveal character or advance the action.*<br/><br/>5. Start as close to the end as possible.<br/><br/>6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them -- in order that the reader may see what they are made of.<br/><br/>7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.<br/><br/>8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.</span><br/><br/>Much of this seems to be the advice we would give each other about our games. <br/><br/>The only one I would disagree with in respect to gaming is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> where I think we do need to all work to make it wonderful not just to ourselves but to each other.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63934/#Comment_63934" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T20:44:04+00:00" title="April 14, 2007  8:44PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting this.

His books have had such an impact on my life since I was a Freshman in high school, 20 some years ago. And I agree good advice for games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63935/#Comment_63935" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T21:59:26+00:00" title="April 14, 2007  9:59PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor, I agree with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a>. Think about GNS for a moment, if it helps.<br/><br/>The "one person" isn't meant literally. Just know that you should realize who you are trying to please. Know your genre, know your audience, know your tone, and know your tools. Having mechanics that support what your game is about is an extension of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63947/#Comment_63947" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-15T04:06:07+00:00" title="April 15, 2007  4:06AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2007 4:14AM by Call Me Curly.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a><br/> <br/>The "one person" Vonnegut refers to trying to please; isn't himself.<br/><br/>Vonnegut said that the one person he wrote his books "to", was his long-deceased sister.   <br/><br/>His choice of what to say &amp; how to say it-- was based on what he'd want to say to her.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> could be re-worded as "don't try to please everyone, do try to please one specific other person".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63948/#Comment_63948" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-15T04:51:49+00:00" title="April 15, 2007  4:51AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also think there are people who cleave to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> and those who cleave away.
