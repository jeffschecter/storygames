In any case, my zombie apocalypse RPG just went live on Kickstarter today at roughly 3:00 pm Pacific Coast Time. Fear The Living focuses on emulating the interpersonal drama, dysfunctional relationships, and brutal choices that make zombie fiction (even the cheesy B-movie stuff like Evil Dead and Zombie Strippers) so great. <br/><br/>Whether you're a fan of the classics (Night of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead, Braindead), a fan of "new-school" zombie media (The Walking Dead, Dead Set, Shaun of the Dead) or just someone who digs light-to-midweight narrative games with a focus on interpersonal relationships and difficult choices during play then check it out. <br/><br/>A link to the Kickstarter mainpage is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2025893540/fear-the-living-rpg" rel="nofollow">HERE</a><br/><br/>For anyone who's interested in taking a look at the system itself, here's the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B97VUsWnBKEtWjJ4VEZFTjVlMWM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Playtest Document</a> and a beautiful homebrew <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B97VUsWnBKEtejdlRmVoTXQtMFk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Survivor Sheet</a> made by rpgnets own Foxkit.<br/><br/>Take a look, let me know what you think thus far, share it with anyone you think might be interested.

We've raised over $900 thus far, with more to come! Meanwhile, I'm searching for a low-cost fulfillment service that might make shipping international orders cost effective. If anyone interested in the game has a recommendation for me based off of their own experience or that of a successful KS creator please let me know. I'm always willing to learn.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
