The six different types of Villain scenes (Corrupt, Villainy, Scheme, Stalk, Confront, Threaten) and the five different types of Hero scenes (Inspire, Fight Crime, Connect, Investigate, Confront) all seem really cool and fun to play out.  Each one manipulates character traits or general setting traits (Justice, Disorder) in measurable ways depending on how the scene plays out.  The game uses a straightforward playing card-based mechanic like some of Joe's other games (Contenders) that is easy to pick up.  When the endgame is triggered (mechanically or when the players decide it's time for the climatic scene), the fate of the innocents is decided by a final conflict between heroes and villains with some interesting ideas for an epilogue about how society is affected in the end.<br/><br/><b>Questions</b><br/><br/>Would it really be that much fun to play the hero?  The villain looks a lot more interesting and exciting.  Maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>Does the game really need a GM (called a Facilitator in the text, possibly because they don't have that much to do aside from framing a scene every now and again)?  Could you have this work just as well by having a third player who actually played the Innocent(s) and had scenes of their own?  Even if the Innocent can't affect the overall narrative in the same way, they are still important and their choices do matter, at least as far as they affect the choices of the hero and villain.  They wouldn't have Gimmicks (superpowers that allow you to draw new cards), but otherwise they could do some interesting stuff.<br/><br/>I'm less sure about how well the game would work with more than a single hero and villain.  The Gwen Stacy story, after all, is basically about three people.  Would it work the same if you had multiple villains targeting multiple, potentially unrelated innocents?  I'm not sure.  Maybe this is a three player game?<br/><br/>You mention, at multiple points in the text, that the innocents might be ravaged, molested, or defiled, presumably by the villain.  I guess, when reading the Gwen Stacy story, this didn't really seem like a possibility to me.  In the modern age of "Women in Refrigerators" comics, definitely, but at the end of the Silver Age?  I'm not so sure.<br/><br/><b>How I Feel About It</b><br/><br/>I'd be really excited to see it in play with 5-6 people to see how it would work.  Perhaps my concerns are unfounded.  That said, I'd be really excited to play it with just 3 players, with the Facilitator taking a strong role in playing the innocent(s), because the game seems so solid.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105936/#Comment_105936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T09:44:47+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  9:44AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jonathon a very insightful and erudite review. If only I could review so well... \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>You mention, at multiple points in the text, that the innocents might be ravaged, molested, or defiled, presumably by the villain.

Although Marvel recently did the awful Sins Past storyline that revealed Gwen Stacy had Norman Osborns children! <br/><br/>I was trying to convey a physical threat and underlying sexual connotations of a helpless heroine in the clutches of a dastardly villain, without violating the comics code! Just thought it might add another layer to the game if it's the innocent's 'purity' at stake rather than simply her life. Hmm could do with re-phrasing that (along with the entire game).<br/><br/>I like the idea of the facilitator having a strong role playing the innocents, seems to make sense. <br/><br/>I'm (plesantly) surprised you didn't think there was more missing. I felt there were a few holes.<br/><br/>you're right that the true test will be with more than three players. Maybe there does need more overlap between innocents. With a bit of luck I might be able to run a game this weekend. <br/><br/>Cheers<br/>JoE                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
