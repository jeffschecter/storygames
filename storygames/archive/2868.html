The thread collecting links for all of these posts is <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2866" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The reason for this is fairly straightforward: while not everyone agrees with this assessment, it is my belief that most RPG rulebooks are essentially teaching texts and/or workbooks or unconsciously modeled after them*. In short, an RPG rulebook's essential task is to teach the game to the person reading it.<br/><br/>As such, being aware of some of the rules of instruction and learning can help you deliver your game into the minds of the players as clearly and painlessly as possible.<br/><br/>(* - With a few notable exceptions like Nobilis, which are ((purposely)) more like a coffeetable book full of surreal short fiction pieces, with RPG rules jotted in the margins.)<br/><br/>What follows is a simple numbered lists of some rules to observe for Adult Learning (read: your target audience are no longer in a regular classroom environment).  I'm simply going to emphasize the key bits in each point and leave this post fairly simple.  If folks want to discuss how to apply a particular rule to a game's design, ask away!<br/><br/><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">During the process of learning, the learners should work harder than the person teaching them the material.</span></i></b><br/><br/><b>1.</b> Adults bring considerable experience with them. Therefore, <b>they wish to speak, participate, and contribute to the proceedings</b>. They dislike long stretches of one-way communication.<br/><br/><b>2.</b> Adults have something to lose. They have a strong need to maintain their personal self-esteem.  Therefore, they should be listened to and <b>we should set up the material so they will be successful at learning the tasks we're setting them</b>.<br/><br/><b>3.</b> Adults want tasks that <b>focus on current situations and tasks</b>, rather than material that may be useful in the distant future. They desire a strong "how-to" and "applicability" focus. They become restless and disengage if they feel their time is being wasted.  Further, an adult will "lose" up to 90% of their \xe2\u20ac\u0153trained and gained\xe2\u20ac\x9d knowledge if it isn't used regularly (within 30 days of either first-training or the last use of the skill).<br/><br/><b>4.</b> Adults see learning as a means to an end, rather than an end to itself.  <b>They must know what there is to gain</b> from a piece of information or mechanic, and they must see progress being made in their understanding and practice.<br/><br/><b>5.</b> Adults are <b>accustomed to being active</b>.   They should be given an opportunity for active participation whenever possible.<br/><br/><b>6.</b> Adults are <b>accustomed to being self-directed</b>.  A group leader (whoever that ends up being, either the GM, another player, or the text) must consult and work with adult learners rather than be too directive.<br/><br/>This one's short, and doesn't have a lot of examples from current games, but I wanted to get it out here for discussion, since it's low-hanging fruit for me in terms of getting it posted.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65088/#Comment_65088" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T14:44:27+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  2:44PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, if you replace "adults" with "teenagers," everything but <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> stays applicable.

Your job is to find concrete things that can anchor the character's abstract desires.  A young noble's aspirations for his family name could be embodied in an heirloom sword, for instance.  Here's a little exercise to do.  Think of one of the characters in the game.  Pick one thing that the character wants, and then think of an object that is closely associated with that one thing.  How can you make it complicated for the character to have that one thing?  Do this for each character, and you have half of a game situation right there.</blockquote>\nThe key is to make it a short, concise demonstration of a skill (or trick) that can be repeated later in other contexts.<br/><br/>Alternately, you can totally set up a book with the expectation that players and GMs will use little notebooks for writing things down as they read.

Even better.<br/><br/>This reminds me of Dogs character creation and the Initiation Scenes.  That's great teaching right there.<br/><br/>No book needs to be able to teach the whole game in one sitting -- it's a process -- having that 'gradual teaching' element loaded into the character generation/first conflict/more chargen is very, very good stuff.<br/><br/>Later, in an Editing thread, I'm going to talk about also making your teaching text a good in-game reference. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  That's a whole 'nuther thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65144/#Comment_65144" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T16:02:37+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  4:02PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doyce</cite>Does it also get everyone making up these characters together?</blockquote>\nYeah.
