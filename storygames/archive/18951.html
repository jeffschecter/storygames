The stats make more sense if connected to the Style, as that's where the moves that use them are, and the rest of it was just a colour questionnaire about the sort of character you wanted to play, which can be done less formally within the group.<br/> - I changed the stats and moves around in favour of something easier to relate to, instead of the more abstract stats (Law, Mercy, etc.) I was using before.<br/> - I've downplayed the use of power points: most of the feedback I received mentioned that players didn't like having to beg for points the whole time and the power points were sometimes being handed out instead of experience, which wasn't the intent behind them.<br/><br/>There are some other minor changes here and there, largely resulting from the above changes, and I'm open to feedback on all aspects of the revised form.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423706/#Comment_423706" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T20:56:56+00:00" title="November  3, 2013  8:56PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks fun.<br/><br/>What does "incapacitated but undefeated" mean in the strike move?

By incapacitating and defeating a foe, they are taken down in both the short term and the long term, so you can write them out of the fiction if you choose. The wording will be changed in the next draft to make that clear.<br/><br/>Heroes are normally limited in the power they can have: when they take power above that limit, they simply take +1 forward instead. If the Blink takes power above their limit when using the advanced Momentum move, then they take the power instead of the +1.<br/><br/>The game has been playtested a few times now, though not all of the changes made here have been, so this is still a work-in-progress; in particular, the new rules for power and the new style moves need a good shakedown. Thank you for the interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423890/#Comment_423890" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T08:26:48+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  8:26AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the clarification, especially with regards to incapacitated and undefeated... I was having a really hard time figuring out how you could be knocked out cold but not be considered defeated until you mentioned the idea of long-term, already-in-motion plans. That makes for an interesting way to deal with super villains.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
