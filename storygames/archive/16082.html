My character in our online game is Drak, a Duergar Barbarian/Warblade,  and is superficially modeled after Riddick from <i>Pitch Black,</i> but despite all of his badass abilities, I wasn't feeling super-stoked about him until recently. I now understand fully why that is.<br/><br/>Being badass is not about having laser eyes and rocket-punching capability (sorry, Voltron). Being badass is about making the right choice when it's someone's ass on the line. Being badass is about coming through in the clutch. And in order to do all that, your character has to actually <i>give a fuck about something.</i> See, we like to do backstories and all, which is good fun. However, 99% of the time, none of these contain any weaknesses.<br/><br/>Our group is in one of those seedy towns full of thieves and ne'er-do-wells - a classic hive of scum and villainy. In this city, which is near a large swamp, the Swamp Elves are traded as slaves. In the course of the adventure, our NPC friend "bought" one such slave (she is completely free to do as she pleases, but he has kept the deed of ownership in order to avoid potential issues within the city), because we need a guide and she is some sort of divine spellcaster as well (Spirit Shaman?). The DM described her as similar to Tia Dalma from the <i>Pirates of the Carribean</i> films. Almost immediately, I thought that she would be a good matchup for Riddick. I mean, WWVDD, amirite? So I decided he would fall in love with her. <br/><br/>So fast forward to the last couple of days in this game, and we are being stopped at a fort along the river while heading into the swamp (on a quest for milady, actually). They tell us we're good to go, but our Swamp Elf needs to be...questioned for an hour or two. So now I'm like "Crap, I hope this doesn't ruin anyone else's fun (you know, by getting them killed or anything), but these fuckers are NOT taking my girlfriend 'out for a spin.'"<br/><br/>So Drak's response:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Drak</cite>Drak is already sizing these ****ers up, looking for possible exits, and preparing to (literally) leap to Juliette's aid.<br/><br/>Of course, on the surface, he seems calm, if a bit annoyed. To the captain, he says cordially, "Look sir, the papers are in order. Ye've inspected all of our belongin's, and found nuttin' tae suggest anything out o' the ordinary. We have pressing matters tae attend ta, so we'll be on our way now, with all of our possessions. We bid ye good day, gentlemen."<br/><br/>Without waiting for a response, he turns to Jer'el and Annie, saying, "Let's get movin', boys."</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: DM</cite>"Oy!" yells the captain, and halberds are levelled at Drak. A few more soldiers appear at the entrance with halberds, and a handful on the walls with bows. "Only the missionaries got pressing business in the swamp. Sure, the paper's in order, but taxes must ... be ... paid. We ain't keeping her, we're just gonna 'inspect' her for awhile. She's a member of a degenerate race, anyway. What? You gone native or something?"</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Drak</cite>In an incredibly calm and matter-of-fact tone, the duergar replies, "Ye do not realize tha mistake ye're makin'. I'm not sure what gave ye the impression that I give a f***, but ye're na takin' no one, no where, what don't want to go wit ye. I'm gonna give ye my word that if ye all lower yer weapons right now, I won't kill nobody. Failin' tha, I'm gonna have me some fun rippin' yer guts out, mister."<br/><br/>This last comment is directed at the captain in particular.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: DM</cite>There are a few incredibly tense seconds that pass. The captain looks like he might be shaken, but then he smiles. "You're right. We're not taking her, and we're not stopping you. But you DID just threaten I and my men ... nay, this fort in particular ... and all for that bitch there. A swamp elf woman, huh? Fine. A couple of tender-hearted 'venturers, huh? Tenderfoot is more like it. Go into the swamps with that slave, and may she be the death of all of you.<br/><br/>"Just think about this ... we ask business of those leaving, but we're the gatekeeper of those coming in. You want to come back ever, at least this way? Let's hope the swamp teaches you respect."<br/><br/>He nods to two soldiers, who cut the mooring lines with their halberds. "Get off my fort, and meet your doom with open arms."</blockquote>\nSorry, because probably all (and certainly most) of you have come to this realization long before I found it and picked it up, dusted it off and wrote a post about it. The crux of it is this: incorporate clear vulnerabilities into your characters. Make them things you'd really care about. And then don't cry foul when the GM fucks with them. Instead, use that fuckery as your opportunity to show how badass you (and by extension, your character) really are.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366568/#Comment_366568" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T11:39:51+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 11:39AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not at all.
