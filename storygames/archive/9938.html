It has not flourished under that neglect. My life as I knew it sort of exploded and transformed into something totally different (and much, much better), and in all the craziness I just didn't have time to pour the required enthusiasm into this site. In addition, my Brand New Life (tm) does not really have the free time or free energy to pick up maintaining the site again. So I need to step away and out of the maintainer position.<br/><br/>Two things can happen, now: first, if somebody or a group of somebodies would like to volunteer to take over the site, I would be more than happy to hand over the keys. I will continue to host it on my hosting plan here at dreamhost (one more site costs me nothing), but the new maintainers would get the FTP passwords and would be responsible for everything else, including drupal updates (unless you ditch drupal). They would also have free reign over the direction and look of the site, short of, you know, fostering race riots or trafficking stolen children. NerdSoCal has done a lot of good for the 'nerd community' in Southern California, and I'd like to see it continue to do so \u2014 I just can't do it myself.<br/><br/>However, if nobody wants to pick up the sizable gauntlet and take over the site, I will be shutting it down. Even in its dormant state, it's a niggling worry in the back of my mind, sitting there on my bookmarks bar making me feel guilty for not poking it with a stick every once in a while to generate activity. I'd rather it was a fond memory than one more dead site cluttering up the internet. Unless somebody claims it, NerdSoCal will go dead October 31st, 2009.<br/><br/><a href="http://nerdsocal.com/?q=node/582" rel="nofollow">More at NerdSoCal.com</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221319/#Comment_221319" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T00:27:55+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 12:27AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be nice if nerdsocal actually had more than 8 participants.  Okay, I'm exaggerating, but honestly for much more than a year it's seem to have been focused only on an inner circle of indie gamer friends.<br/><br/>It needs to go way, way beyond that and aim to be inclusive to more than gamers -- everything from folks wanting to take a nature hike to musicians pimping their local performances.  I *hate* the label of nerd but if I'm going to live with it, I would suggest a "nerd" means anyone who's interested in thought-provoking recreation.  Here's hoping that any future incarnation of nerdsocal keeps that in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kiznit" title="kiznit"><img alt="kiznit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kiznit">kiznit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221865/#Comment_221865" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T17:33:53+00:00" title="July 31, 2009  5:33PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I just joined! :(<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, I'm in Los Angeles, and very interested in meeting other Indie gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221876/#Comment_221876" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T21:18:23+00:00" title="July 31, 2009  9:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well then, post something on the site, Kirin. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222239/#Comment_222239" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T12:15:03+00:00" title="August  3, 2009 12:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gateway is coming up.
