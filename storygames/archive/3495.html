This post is inspired by few things. First and foremost, the Hugely neat thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3131&amp;page=1#Item_28" rel="nofollow">Help Me Try Out this Setting Construction Engine</a>. Second is the idea that says "setting is in the rules". I don't know where this originates, but I'm fascinated by it. <br/><br/>Why I like it?  Probably because of general (and personal) complaint that you have huge amounts of games that have interesting setting and premise but then the play turns out to be something completely different. If the setting is laid "between the lines" in the mechanics this surely can't happen? <br/><br/>Might I then tap your creative energies and excellent ideas to try this out? Feel free to say "Boo! Not smart!" or "Doesn't belong here!" if you feel like it, but, here goes.<br/><br/>So, let's create yet again human-centric fantasy with scheming nobles, powerful people and cruelty and hope. In bit style of Martin or even Hobb. The means to do this are the following:\n<ol>\n<li> Add a Goal to this thread. For example: "I want to see rules for the Kings Rangers!"<br/></li><li>Quote previous Goal or bit of mechanics and add relevant Key, which brings out the bit of setting according to TSoY rules.<br/></li><li>Quote previous Goal or bit of mechanics and add relevant Secret, which brings out the bit of setting. Mainly follow the TSoY guidelines, but you can make things that introduce other pools and other weird stuff, if you can fit the description in a paragraph.<br/></li><li>Add a set of skills (4) to represent some group of people.<br/></li><li> Awesomize a written key, secret or skill.</li>\n</ol>\nSo, no fluff-text except a line or two in descriptions of keys, skills and secrets. Try to wait other replies (If there is any) before posting another, though each post could contain several items.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Discordian" title="Discordian"><img alt="Discordian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Discordian">Discordian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78884/#Comment_78884" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T02:08:38+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  2:08AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Secret of House Allesandro</b><br/>You are member of House Allesandro, know for it's riches.
