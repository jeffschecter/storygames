She Bends time to find a remote-control car with a mounted camera, and sends it to investigate.  Through the camera she sees that a time bandit has just shot a trucker.  The trucker is bleeding out, and the time bandit is driving away.  The Kid Bends time again to find a robot double of the trucker, and time jumps back to yesterday.  She hides in the other end of the alley, so her earlier self won't see her, and spends the day building the camera car and planting it for herself to find.  She tries to save the trucker by switching him with the robot before he gets shot, but when she's talking to the trucker she draws a Black Joker.  The time bandit shows up, and since the Kid is in the way, he shoots her.  We end the session with the Kid laying bleeding by the highway.<br/><br/>The Bend for the remote-control car was resolved by the end of the session, but the Bend for the robot double wasn't, so it causes Paradox.

Needless to say, the two innocents (the bookstore clerk and the clueless toff) came off the worst, while the two Satanists came up smelling of roses.
