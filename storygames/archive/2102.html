                    Out of <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=302312" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a> over at RPG.net I got the idea of really digging into Alignment in D&amp;D. What if everyone's soul really was made up of certain proportions of good, evil, chaos, and law, and you could sense it, manipulate it, maybe even use it?<br/><br/>The original idea was making a necromantic healer. You start off a long way over on the Good side of the alignment square, "spending" your goodness to heal people. Maybe you can reach a certain distance from your original alignment before permanent effects set in. Then, because you've spent your goodness, you're left with evilness, which you expend by beating the shit out of orcs and taking their pie. You focus the evil into death magic or weapon power, removing it from your system and pushing you back towards the good side of the square. People who start near the center of the square are more flexible, but less powerful, because they can't reach the extremes as easily as others.<br/><br/>L.E. Modesitt's <i>Recluse</i> series would probably give good ideas as to what you might do by expelling law or chaos from yourself, but the base idea below it is completely different - those wizards reinforce the law or chaos within themselves by using it, while the characters I'm thinking of would create <i>opposing</i> effects within themselves.<br/><br/>Anyway, I just wanted to share that little inspiration with you folks. Has anyone done anything like that before?                </div>

                            This seems a natural extension of the treatment of alignment in Planescape, which was by far the best, most detailed and most creative. I like it.                        </div>
