I'll let Eero presents it: <br/>"<i>Avalanche is a unique and crazily ambitious high-fantasy setting. Imagine the scope and ambition of the Dragonlance campaign, except no rules-system, no plot railroad, and the material has all been arranged into a reference system consisting of time-lines, dramatis personae and geographical atlases, so as to make it feasible for the GM to handle the high density of information. Very unique due to the novel timeline-oriented campaign arc, well worth the time for anybody interested in high-fantasy adventure rpgs.</i>"<br/><br/>Eero Tuovinen, game designer<br/><br/>Thanks for your time and interest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430198/#Comment_430198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T17:04:59+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  5:04PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing - if you get a 1-year subscription is it it a code you can enter anytime will it start at a specific, pre-determined time and run for a year?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430223/#Comment_430223" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T11:23:14+00:00" title="March 29, 2014 11:23AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One thing - if you get a 1-year subscription is it it a code you can enter anytime will it start at a specific, pre-determined time and run for a year?</blockquote>\nWe were thinking of starting it at a specific date, at the beginning of September. But, I guess that if a DM was to ask us to start its membership later (for various reasons), I'd see no reason not to accept.<br/><br/>My campaign is starting much slower than I expected. Conversion rate from Facebook are just plain horrible. We also had trouble with the banners. <br/>Avalanche needs to find its public.

What is really killing us is the lack of a fans base!!! Anyway, when starting a KS campaign, you have to plan for failure. <br/><br/>Here's our plan B:<br/>Avalanche is done, or almost. We'll get it into pdf and publish it using a traditional way (maybe drivethrurpg) this summer, offer support, find DMs and have Avalanche be played. There is a lot I can salvage from the KS: the teasers are good, the video (once we only present the setting) is good, we have the final layout ... Once we'll reach about 400 or 500 DMs, we may then attempt to do a KS for a printed copy or even this website. That said, I didn't have a proper, easy to sell product until recently.<br/><br/>Question: I intend to let run this KS campaign until half its life (thus 21 more days). What do you think? Letting in run does it help me or hinders me in achieving my plan B?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430345/#Comment_430345" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T13:05:08+00:00" title="March 31, 2014  1:05PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, defending the value of this project was not easy.

That is also one of the problem we encountered: I stink at social media, and I was quite alone in this (and you can see people helping out are making mistakes; or so it seems).<br/><br/>At the moment, I'm distributing free copy of the unedited pdf version of Avalanche to DMs wishing to try it. I need people to play it, report about it ... That's what you would call your 'alpha' version (I can't have a website ... too costly). I'm going to push this over during the week: get more DMs.<br/><br/>Like I said, we did prepared for failure. I'm quite zen about it.

I think there are lessons to be learned here.<br/><br/>We're going to let the KS campaign run until at least half of his 'life' (21 days). We're going to give a little fight here. Anyway, I think it serves us well at the moment. Analytics are just plain bad. We've stopped all FB ads. Banners are still going on BGG, as they are paid for, but still no conversion.<br/><br/>But I'm still using FB. Yesterday, we have decided to distribute for free the 'unedited version' of Avalanche. The text needs some solid work (Cal Moore is doing an excellent work for us), but all the illustrations are there. It also needs a good introduction, some guidelines. We're distributing the link for the pdf by email (so I've got those, at least) after a request on FB. We have distributed around 40 copies. I'm quite happy about it. We made the announcement in an post and use the 'promote function'. I do find it to be cheaper and more efficient than ads (that is not hard to beat). Also, a way to try to use my 1400 fans on FB. I don't expect all of them to play it, but I could feel some excitement.<br/><br/>I should have been doing this a long time ago, before the start of the campaign. That said I only had the 'unedited' version about a month ago.<br/>Maybe a very important point here: the KickStarter really served us as a big motivation to 'complete' the project and turn it into a product. Now, we have this product, it still needs some edition, but I'm pretty sure I can sell it. It will take a long time and it will be a hobby and it's all fine. Surely I won't raise enough money for a website, but it is thanks to KS that I'm doing, what I think is the right thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430446/#Comment_430446" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T16:24:42+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  4:24PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2014 4:26PM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            $28,000 is a little bit on the hefty side.

Shiny, complete illustrations make the text look more done than it is. You don't want interested-but-doubtful people to see the unedited preview, assume it's complete, and be turned off by its incompleteness. Even if they "know" it's incomplete, if it looks polished enough, their instinct will treat it as if it's complete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430456/#Comment_430456" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T21:39:01+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  9:39PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add that you might want to find one community, and focus on making the game for that. In most of the systems you mentioned, to a greater or lesser extent, there's a need to stat out encounters before hand. That's often the least fun aspect of any of these games. If you made something that was an awesome Pathfinder or 13th Age or whatever multi-threaded campaign, that was just ready to run from the word go (rather than kind of still needing a large amount of prep week to week), you might find an audience there, and then other groups/systems would be interested in having the system ported.<br/><br/>I think keeping a kickstarter up when you're not updating, nor have a shot of success, is probably a pretty bad idea: it'll draw attention towards it, and reinforce the failure. It's also, for people who aren't following this thread, potentially making backers feel like they took a bad shot. I'd at least keep them in the loop as to what's going on with updates. The people who were willing to pay money are your audience and people worth talking to much more so than the people in this thread are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
