(I wrote a longer account of this here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/371706#Comment_371706" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/371706#Comment_371706</a>)<br/><br/>I regret nothing, but I realized that, to this day, I basically know nothing about how 2E works or what it's like to play. It seems like sort of the lost edition - lots of people play Basic, AD&amp;D, and 3.5, but not so many still play 2E. So, what was/is good about it? What did it do better than other editions?

I think it never got to the game table with us, though; too confused all around, was our thinking at the time.<br/><br/>I guess that the only part of 2nd edition that interests me from today's perspective are the settings, some of which feature pretty nice fantasy authorship; I suspect that they would be difficult to use for actual play for me (would need to design a game specifically to utilize them, I suppose), but as rpg setting literature they're occasionally pretty nice reads. The vast majority of everything else 2nd edition has proved to fail the test of time: the game design is either insipid or half-baked much too often, failing to provide either elegance or completeness. The contrast of original D&amp;D on the bottom, Mentzer Basic sideways in the next slot, and 3rd edition on the topside leaves 2nd edition seeming entirely inferior, looking at it as a design with the benefit of hindsight.<br/><br/>For the sake of fairness, some people give 2nd edition big points for modular complexity. I don't, but that's mostly because I don't particularly desire modularity from a game. Even if I did, though, I would find the level of consideration in the design completely unacceptable by modern standards (and probably the standards of the day as well, but that's more difficult to gauge), and would rather just pull 101 house rule documents off the Internet rather than subject myself to those Player's Option books and their ilk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422258/#Comment_422258" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T13:50:46+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  1:50PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did 2nd edition introduce skills (or, rather "non-weapon proficiencies", urgh)?

(Yeah, 3.x and 4e fans bicker, but they share many traits in what they want from D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>2nd edition isn't old school enough for the OSR types, as it is about big damn heroes on epic quests instead of fantasy Vietnam (and a large number of rules and supplements, especially by the end of the run).  2nd edition isn't modern enough for the WotC era crowds, as it is a jumbled mess of decades worth of houserules rather than a coherent system like 3.x or 4e.  <br/><br/>2nd edition wasn't very well loved even when it came out.  It was the edition where Vampire started outselling D&amp;D. (That period and possibly the 4e period are the only times that D&amp;D wasn't the best selling rpg on the market.)  Not coincidentally, it was also the edition of TSR's slide into bankruptcy and getting bought by WotC.  So there aren't as many people yearning for the old edition with nostalgia as there are for, say the editions from the early 80s when D&amp;D was growing rapidly.  Nor are there as many folks still around who have been playing continuously, as there are for 3.x or 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422268/#Comment_422268" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T16:15:28+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  4:15PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think it institutionalized THAC0 (which had been a house rule / Dragon Magazine suggestion until then).</blockquote>\nTo Hit Armor Class 0 actually comes straight out of the 1st edition Dungeon Master's Guide.

It seemed to me that none of the other systems just let me play my character.  There were all these skills and points and rules and crap.  The Weapon/Non-Weapon proficiency system in 2e was so loose and so easy that I felt at liberty just to ad-lib my character doing stuff and only rolling to add emphasis to the action.  Outside of combat, that is.  If I wanted a system that really supported staying in character, talking in character, and immersion, it would be AD&amp;D2e.

In the interest of complete honesty, though, I have to remark that while the binder format can be used proactively like that, the overall game and the culture around it perhaps didn't encourage or support it. I mean, if I were doing the binder thing, I would surely publish more varied material for it, including e.g. lairs and optional-depth content pertaining to individual monsters, as well as advice and schemes for how the binder should be actually tricked out for an individual campaign. In execution the binder fell short in small practical ways, such as by printing unrelated monsters on the backsides of sheets, and by sticking so close to the stat block accountancy scheme that it was somewhat rare for a given monster to actually have useful, gameable content in its description. I never realized before Jason pointed it out just now that the loose-leaf monster manual could be seen as a starting point for self-made campaign prep, it always seemed more like a sort of precursor to Pokemon or something.<br/><br/>(Of course the true grognard can now say that it's a failure of imagination on my part to require somebody to tell me that I can trick out a binder to actually serve my own needs. This well may be, but the fact remains that the only concrete use case that I ever heard of from TSR was that you could remove and add pages to only carry the ones that you're using in your campaign. That's not really that useful a remark, given that at least I don't begin campaign planning by whitelisting a bunch of monsters that I intend to use.)<br/><br/>Definitely an idea worth revisiting, though. I could see room for a D&amp;D binder product that came with a bunch of generally useful things, as well as advice and ideas for how to build up your own binder to best serve a campaign's needs. Nowadays you can print your own sheets, too, so no need for the massive TSR publishing machine to sell monster entries in drips and drabs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422330/#Comment_422330" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T14:45:52+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  2:45PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, the binder could have been improved/pursued more aggressively!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422333/#Comment_422333" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T15:43:12+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  3:43PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The binder is just the laptop or tablet full of PDFs of yesteryear, grandpas. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422334/#Comment_422334" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T16:17:32+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  4:17PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference is always utility, interface, realistic use cases. The tablet full of PDFs is fully within my reach, yet I fail to utilize it, as a random collection of 200 old school D&amp;D PDFs is an entirely useless thing by itself, without a mind driving the material. To make any such mass of information on-the-spot useful for actual play, you need very carefully planned procedures, a high degree of familiarity with the material, and indexing, so that you know what material to draw from the files, for what reason, when. Of course one could trick out a tablet to achieve this utility, but it is not particularly more suited to it than a binder.<br/><br/>The guy who DMs the campaign I'm currently playing in uses both a binder and a tablet, in fact, but it is notable that the tablet is for adventure module referencing (a single file open in it for the entire session), while all the complex interconnected sandboxing shit (random encounters, maps, monster references, charts, randomizing tables, etc.) is in the binder. He's maybe not quite as facile with computer tools as I am myself (he is a programmer by trade, though), yet I'd say that I would prefer working primarily on paper myself as well.<br/><br/>Last year, when I was running a full-blown campaign, I actually wrote and developed my material on a computer, but opted to print it out for filing and use at the game table; you just get more filing options and utility with less overhead when dealing with paper.

So my first RPG experience ever was Star Frontiers, and the game that got me "into gaming: playing/running" was Paranoia. And I was always into eclectic RPGs, at least buying/reading them with allowance money, but not having enough energy to organize sessions except for at Boy Scout Camp or once every few months on a weekend day.<br/><br/>I got in very early on AD&amp;D 2E, and it was the first version of D&amp;D that I played or read. Just a random number of factors added up in high school, and my sophomore year (the year where I took, IIRC, about 1/3 of the school year off and no one noticed) I found myself in a wonderful, enthusiastic, friendly RPG group that consisted mostly of my best friend, a young DM who would also later become a lifelong friend, and another 1-2 of his friends, well meaning and active. So it was definitely one of those "non-painful introductions".<br/><br/>This was, again happenstance, a year-plus before Vampire, before Shadowrun, before the new settings dropped (I remember being excited for each one!). I got in on the ground floor with AD&amp;D. I think the first supplement I bought was the Fighter's Handbook, which was okay, but the Thieves' one was cover-to-cover inspiration.<br/><br/>And the thing is, even though at that point I had created and run homebrew RPGs (based on Paranoia!) and was reading and experimenting with others (again, as they came out, TORG, Shadowrun, etc), I never saw anything necessarily "bad" or "problematic" about the rules. They Just Were. So I would read the "Complete X Handbooks" and the like to see ways to make characters and DMing and settings more interesting, but never thought "this weird conglomerate of crap is incoherent", rather "Oh, a new kind of Non-Weapon Proficiency. This will look FABULOUS on my two-sword fighter!". <br/><br/>I do remember that when Gamma World 4th Edition came out, it reversed THAC0: Armor started at 10 and went up, levels gave you +1 to hit and the like. I thought "This is SUPER intuitive!" and I actually stole that method, importing it into my Dark Sun games and the like from that point on; ditched THAC0 entirely from that point on. Nodded in satisfaction when I was following Eric Noah's D&amp;D3E fanpage, when it was confirmed that 3E would have the same system.<br/><br/>The Player's Option books came out just as I was going into college, which is where my gaming mostly died/went into a coma for a few years (which is like the exact opposite of Everyone Else's experience!), so while I thought they were pretty cool, I never utilized them in more than 3-4 sessions as either a DM or Player.<br/><br/>So, in my eyes, there was a lot of prolific shit in 2E for all its myriad settings; and we definitely had fun with the game, but a lot of it was despite/around the system rather than because of it. But because it was the biggest system, and we were in love with what we were doing at the table, we embraced it, warts and all, and navigated it from within than attempting to destroy it from the outside.<br/><br/>No, that latter would come later.

They are both first attempts to systematize the one major part of D&amp;Dism that 1e didn't: freewheeling messy rules that incorporate whatever you happen to have lying around. And although it's demonstrable that in some ways it failed in the market I find it incredibly more appealing in terms of creativity, inspiration, etc., as well as my sense of ethics as compared to the much more strict 3e/4e style of supplement marketing. It's a part of why the OSR has been successful on its own terms: D&amp;D is a messy game.<br/><br/>In the core books there are all these rules marked as optional too, which weren't present in 1e. It was obviously something that was really exciting to the team at TSR, a recognition of something present in their game. I think it's strange that so much pain has been spent in later editions trying to rebrand campaign settings (especially FR) as less monolithic, giving permission for players to mess them up without knowing every little detail ever published, because the fact that there were so many books and moving pieces came directly out of this era of crazy bits-and-pieces use-what-you-like game design, and that rebranding took place within a culture of increasingly strict expectations of completeness, as 3 and 4 made big attempts at creating unified mechanical structures as well as unified marketing structures.<br/><br/>The thieves handbook is so good in every way, also.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422463/#Comment_422463" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-05T15:48:08+00:00" title="October  5, 2013  3:48PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, the arms and equipment guide.

There was nothing good about AD&amp;D2.  The small bits that seems good are (badly) copied from older better games (the non weapons proficiencies were a badly implemented unbalanced boring attempt to copy the skill systems that most of the others rpgs had for more than ten years at that time. The "Binder" idea was stolen from Harn and Harnmaster, that did it much better.)<br/><br/>AD&amp;D2 came out when AD&amp;D was by far the king of the market, even more than now. It come out when the rpg world was bristling with very good new games and innovations (just to make an example, Ars Magica was there already, so you could have published directly D&amp;D 3.0 at that time without it being a particular innovation). TSR had the resources to make it a decent game, at least.<br/><br/>Instead, they did choose to publish a never playtested (the authors on staff at tsr at the time confirm this, there was no playtesting program for ANY product, if the author wanted to playtest anything it was on his time and his own dime) mismatched patchwork of badly copied rules. It would have been old and derivative in 1979.  In 1987 it was ridiculous, a total rip-off.<br/><br/>But it was the king of the market, and so it did stifle innovations, knowledge of new techniques (AD&amp;D groups were really ten years behind, even 1978-style skill-based systems were "strange and useless innovations" to them) and did drive away (or at least back to AD&amp;D1) a lot of people.<br/><br/>Worse, having probably the worst system on the market, it strongly pushed the "rules are only suggestions, the DM can change rules , ignore them, fudge dice rolls, in service of his railroaded "story", and if he is a "good GM" the game will works" meme, that plagued the scene for years giving us scores of very bad games build on the assumption that "rules doesn't count" and gave "story" a very bad name for a lot of people (to this day, when you talk of a "storygame" or "narrativism" to a AD&amp;D2-raised player, they thinks you are talking about railroading).<br/><br/>It was not a rpg, it was a rip-off to steal some money from

AD&amp;D2, I am posting some bits from a published module. i did already post it in Ron Edwards's new forum, but parts of it are very relevant here too.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/>A textual example, from "FA1 - Halls of the High Kings" an adventure module written by Ed Greenwood and published in 1990<br/><br/>Ed Greenwood is not a small figure in AD&amp;D2: he is the creator and principal writer of the Forgotten Realms, the default setting He was published almost in every issue of Dragon Magazine for a decade, so he was put practically as an "example" of a good GM, a good world creator, a good module author, a good articles writer, in AD&amp;D2 terms.<br/><br/>This is the start of the adventure:<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><i>This adventure can begin in any port city on the Sword Coast of the Realms(Waterdeep or Baldur\x92s Gate are obvious choices). It is suggested the adventure begin when the PCs are restless, low on funds, or need to relocate quickly to avoid enemies, the authorities, or a heavy tax.<br/>The PCs are approached by a short, fat, richly dressed merchant. \x93Your pardon, sirs,\x94 he says in a quiet, determined voice. \x93Could your services be had for hire? I am Panthras, of Panthras Procuring, and I\x92d like to do business with you.\x94<br/>Panthras has shrewd eyes set in a weather-beaten face. He is a street-smart, retired caravan master.<br/>Panthras: AC 2 (bracers of defense); MV 12; F 10; hp 79; THAC0 11; <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23AT&amp;Mode=like">#AT</a> 3/2; Dmg by weapon; S 16 ( + 1 on dmg.), D 14, C 16, I 15, W 17, Ch 14; ML 15; AL NG.<br/>Panthras is armed with a long sword (1d8 dmg.), five throwing daggers (1d4 dmg each), and several magical defenses (see below), any or all of which he will use if the PCs are foolish enough to tangle with him. He is not interested in battling the PCs, however, but in hiring them. He will ask to meet the PCs somewhere private of their choosing\x97 or, if they\x92ve no place to offer, in a back room of The Blunt Axe tavern.<br/>Panthras will initially offer the PCs 30 gp and four potions of healing each to perform \x93a guard mission\x94 for him. He will reveal more and, if necessary, offer up to 3,000 gp as he bargains.<br/>Panthras needs a band of adventurers who command some magic and as much experience as possible to see a shipboard cargo of his safe to its destination. The cargo consists of sixty tarred and sealed wooden crates, each containing twenty new long swords of the finest make. The swords must reach the Cantrev of Aithe in Callidyrr, a kingdom on the Moonshae Isles. (If the PCs ask, Aithe lies on the western coast of the island of Alaron, northwest of Doncastle, where a cape \x97Moonfall Ridge-juts out into the sea west of Dernall Forest.)<br/>The PCs\x92 mission, if they accept, will be to deliver the swords safely to the local lord, Haembar \x93Hawkenhound\x94 Cauldyth. Panthras also produces a contract for the PCs to sign. It specifies how many swords the PCs are being hired to \x93...see safely into the hands of Lord Cauldyth of Aithe, or his successor in the lordship of Cantrev Aithe, to the best of their honor and abilities.\x94<br/>[...]<br/>Panthras will turn away from the PCs for a moment, saying, \x93"There is more. Read this, please".\x94 He produces a portable hole and draws from it a sealed parchment, slipping the hole back into the breast pocket from whence he drew it. Before proffering the parchment, he hesitantly adds, \x93I must warn you: once you\x92ve unsealed this document, I cannot allow you to withdraw from the mission and live; this is a matter of state security. Consider your actions carefully, then. Upon my honor, the document contains no alteration in your agreed task.\x94<br/>The parchment is sealed with a wolfs head: the Lone Wolf of the Kendrick family. If the PCs open it, they will read: To those who accept the bond of Panthras and with it the swordguard mission to Aithe: My thanks and my debt. Dark days have come to the Moonshae Isles again, and we are in need of the strong and the valiant. Be it known that I personally shall award four thousand pieces of gold, above and beyond your pay, to each adventurer in your band who comes to Caer Callidyrr and asks for it, assuming the blades arrive safely in the hands of the Lord of Aithe. I will offer more, at that time, to those among you who will give us substantial aid against the foes that beset us in the Moonshaes\x97dark men skulking behind witless pawns who may try to seize that which you guard.<br/>Bring this letter to me in Caer Callidyrr, and accept the thanks, welcome, and hospitality of:<br/>Iristan Kendrick<br/>High King of the Ffolk</i><br/><br/>[OK, it's one of the worst "stranger talk to you in a tavern" start of an adventure ever, but it seems a normal offer up to this moment... read on: ]<br/><br/><i>If any PCs attack Panthras during the encounter, or if they try to renounce their part in the agreement to his face after the document has been unsealed, the merchant\x92s most powerful defense will act.<br/>The mage Flamsterd, who has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eavesdropping invisibly on the negotiations, concealed against magical detection by his own personal magics</span>, will cast a forget spell on the PCs. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If hostilities erupt and he deems it necessary, a time stop will be cast first, after which he will remove the High King\x92s letter and move all PC weapons, magic items, scrolls, potions, and the like into a pile in the center of the gathering.</span><br/>In brief, Flamsterd is a powerful archmage (Wizard, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">21st Level</span>) who carries <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whatever magic items and spells a DM wishes to give him</span>. He is a gentle man, firm but polite, with a kindly manner, but he has learned that the best response to those who attack him or thwart his will is a quick and heavy-handed magical attack. (He can ask the corpses questions later and apologize to the remains if he\x92s made a mistake.)<br/></i><br/>[the adventure is for character of at least 6th level, and right at the beginning if they don't want to go they are beaten by a 21th level archmage]<br/><br/>-------------------<br/><br/>(I'll continue in the next post, this is too long)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422630/#Comment_422630" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T07:14:56+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  7:14AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued from the previous post)<br/><br/>[look at the level of the details for the mage. A Mary Sue? Probably the DM character, Ed was (in)famous for the "DM characters" he wrote in his modules, like the Mage Elminster]<br/><br/><i>Flamsterd is an eminent sage, his major field of expertise being the history, lore, and works of written magic. His minor interests include the history of human settlement and deeds in north-western Faerun, and of the Ffolk of the Moonshaes in particular.<br/>Flamsterd\x92s eyes flash and his voice grows stern when he deems it necessary, and although he seems quick to anger, he has iron self-control. He will often act more angry than he really is in order to cow opponents or lure them into revealing their true attitudes or foolish battle strategies.He is armed with a dagger +2, longtooth and also with six darts of paralyzation. These +1 darts cause their victim to save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed for 1 turn. They do not automatically return to the thrower, but neither do they lose their magic if they miss a target.<br/>Flamsterd appears as a slim, distinguished-looking, long-bearded man of average height. His long, predominantly white beard, which still has some strands of black left, is often tucked into his belt or drawn up and flung over one shoulder to keep it out of the dirt. He customarily wears plain gray robes and (only when traveling outside his home) a red cloak. These continuously curl and flap around him, seemingly of their own volition, due to the cloak\x92s power to emit a sudden gust of wind once every second round, at Flamsterd\x92s will. This handy piece of magic serves to extinguish or dramatically heighten campfires where he appears, deflect arrows or other missiles, and so on.<br/>Flamsterd is famous and well-thought of around the Isles, by Llewyrr, dwarves, halflings and Ffolk alike. His appearances are news, and his kindnesses (such as magically rescuing livestock or people, mending broken fences or roofs that leak, repairing bridges and clearing spring ice to prevent floods) are legendary. A teleport ring, which he is never without, allows him to appear and depart suddenly and silently. Like his colleagues Khelben Arunsun and Elminster, Flamsterd is a friend to the Harpers and shares their aims of protecting the land, the weak and needy who dwell in it, and upholding honesty, fair dealing, and peace.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flamsterd may appear from time to time during this adventure as desired</span>. Long-term campaign play in the Moon-shaes will require a DM to detail Flamsterd\x92s spells, possessions, abode, and activities more extensively.<br/>Flamsterd: AC -2 (plain robes plus a cloak of protection +5, a ring of protection +3, and his Dex bonus); MV 12; W 21; hp 49; THAC0 14; <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23AT&amp;Mode=like">#AT</a> 1; Dmg by spell or weapon; S 14, D 18, C 15, I 18, W 17, Ch 16; ML 15; AL NG).<br/>If the PCs accept the mission, Panthras will produce his portable hole and make the payment agreed upon-on the spot. He will tell the PCs to report to the caravel Mermaid Sword at the docks three mornings hence (or whatever time the DM desires in order to allow the PCs to fully rest, heal and regain spells and gear or to have another, short adventure). After bidding the PCs good day, he leaves. If any PC rushes after him or tries to follow him \x93on the sly,\x94 they will find that he has vanished. (In reality, Flamsterd has cast invisibility on the merchant and they both teleport away.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the PCs refuse the bargain and elect to go their own way, they will see Panthras seeking out adventurers wherever they go in the days that follow</span>. If they get down on their luck, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he will reappear and try them again, even finding his way into dungeons they\x92ve gotten lost in or prisons they\x92ve been incarcerated in (offering, of course, to free them if they accept his job offer).</span><br/>Flamsterd will accompany Panthras as an invisible protector at all times. Oddly enough, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PC attacks on Panthras will not diminish his enthusiasm to try to hire them.</span></i><br/><br/>----------------------------------<br/><br/>(I'll continue in the next post... what the hell happened to story-games posting limits?

underline;">If the PCs still seem reluctant to undertake the mission, introduce the next event</span>.<br/><br/>A Visitor by Night<br/>Whenever two or more PCs are together, after dark, a pale blue radiance will suddenly spring into being nearby, growing rapidly brighter. It expands as a whirling, pulsing ball to become the ghostly image of an upright, detached human hand, which turns to point into the darkness and fades away.<br/>If the PCs look where the hand is pointing, they see a slim, distinguished-looking man, wearing gray robes and a red cloak that seem to swirl and shift by themselves, as if disturbed by an unseen, unfelt wind. The man\x92s white beard is so long that he\x92s tucked it into his belt to avoid treading on it. A few hairs as black as a raven\x92s remain around his lower lip, among their snow-white brothers. The man regards them gravely, and says, \x93Well met. I come in peace, to speak of war and danger\x94 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the wizard Flamsterd who has appeared via his teleport ring and created the hand. If the PCs don\x92t look where the hand is pointing, Flamsterd will clear his throat loudly to get their attention. If that doesn\x92t work, he will simply walk right in among the PCs, stepping on anyone who\x92s sleeping.</span><br/>Flamsterd slowly looks around at all of the PCs present, and says, \x93I understand you are adventurers.\x94 He will wait for a reply, but whether or not one is given, will continue: \x93My land has need of adventurers. I am come from the Moonshae Isles, that men hereabouts sometimes call the \x93jewels on the hilts of The Sea of Swords.\x94 My fair land has faced evil aplenty in recent years, and its folk are weary and sick of death and blood-magic and blades. A new evil has come to our shores; evil never grows tired. I need you, and others like you, to fight this evil. Are you willing?\x94<br/>Flamsterd will quietly and politely answer PC queries. He will not bluster and cannot be pressured into bargains or admissions. He will say that the evil of which he speaks consists of \x93. . . brigands, undead, and darker creatures, all of them guided and goaded on by priests of the god Bane, The Lord of Tyranny.\x94<br/>If PCs ask for payment for aiding the Moonshaes, Flamsterd will reply that the High King has already offered them \x93coins, and more.\x94 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(If the PCs did not read the letter that Panthras bore, Flamsterd will produce it now, offering it without the state security warning Panthras was obligated to offer.)</span><br/>Flamsterd will tell the PCs he can offer them his friendship, aid at times when they are in the Moonshaes, and magical tutelage in a single spell of their choosing, when the evil is defeated. If any PCs are Harpers, Flamsterd will call on them as Harpers to do their duty and aid the Moonshaes, invoking the names of any powerful Harpers that may be known to the PCs.<br/>If the PCs seem willing, Flamsterd will tell them to report to the Mermaid Sword, a caravel owned by the High King, at a particular dock three mornings hence. (Once again, the time period can be adjusted to suit the DM\x92s purposes.).<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the PCs are unwilling, Flamsterd will shake his head sorrowfully, and sigh. \x93I see no heroes here,\x94 he will announce. \x93Indeed, none of you can even strike true with a blade!\x94 With these words, the wizard will vanish, using his ring to teleport away.</span> If Flamsterd is attacked at any time during this encounter, he will utter these words and vanish.<br/>Flamsterd has enacted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a powerful steel curse</span>, once widely used in the North. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This type of curse prevents a victim from successfully attacking with any bladed weapon, from a bill to a belt-knife -and all PCs present at Flamsterd\x92s visit are affected!!</span> Attempts to<br/>use bladed weapons as clubs, or to strike them against walls, trees, and other immobile targets, will cause the blade to shatter into tiny shards with no damage to wielder or target (magical weapons also affected) at every attempt. Bladed weapons are simply useless to the cursed beings <span style="text-decoration: underline;">until a number of months equal to the level of the caster (in Flamsterd\x92s case, 21 months) have passed, or until the curse is lifted.</span><br/>A steel curse can be lifted instantly by the caster or by the application of a remove curse by a wizard of fourteenth level or greater on each and every affected being. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flamsterd will lift it if the PCs undertake the mission</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remove curse spells cast by lesser wizards, and dispel magic spells, will have no effect.</span><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One last method of tumbling reluctant PCs into the adventure is to have them run afoul of enemies or the authorities in a dockside area and start a chase</span>, with the PCs fleeing from a trap or overwhelming force. Their flight leads them to the water, where a caravel, the Mermaid Sword, is just casting off. The captain waves the PCs aboard, face alight. \x93Are you the promised ones?\x82\x94 she cries. \x93Come on, then! We sail before the day\x92s three breaths older!\x94</i><br/><br/>[All this complicated mess only to have the PC go in the adventure makes me think that Ed Greenwood had many problems with players that stubbornly refused to go in another of his "adventures" and he never, even, discovered the simple technique of saying "guys, would you like to play an adventure here and there to do this? Yes? OK, you start directly on a ship..."]<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------<br/> (I'll continue in the next post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422632/#Comment_422632" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T07:16:29+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  7:16AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "OK, this was a very railroaded "plot hook", but the adventure can't be so pre-scripted, right?"<br/>You wish...<br/><br/>The ENTIRE module is like this. Just to show some other examples:<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/>This is from a moment where they MUST go on a new part of the adventures:<br/><br/><i>DM Note: If the PCs are too weak to be victorious in this adventure, Lord Cauldyth and Rhiara may join the party or turn up as surprise reinforcements when the PCs are hurting and in a bad spot. Cauldyth will most generally come thundering along to the rescue in his old and battered armor astride a mighty charger. He will plunge into battle with gusto, bellowing war-cries (\x93For Aithe and freedom!\x93, \x93For the Goddess!\x94, and \x93Cauldyth is upon you!\x94 seem to be favorites). Rhiara is quieter in battle, but just as ruthless.</i><br/><br/>So, the PC HAVE to win. If they are too weak, the GM simply has to use two uber-NPC to win the battle for them and "keep them on the track"..<br/><br/>What happen if the PC don't follow the track in a timely manner?<br/><br/><i>If the PCs tarry overmuch in Aithe, townsfolk will begin to ask when they\x92ll \x93set right what is wrong;\x94 first of each other, within earshot of PCs, and later directly questioning PCs. If the PCs stay twenty nights or more without setting forth into the Wild Wood, the townsfolk will begin to avoid them, murmur \x93cowards\x94 in the streets and taverns when the PCs are near, and generally grow tired of seeing the PCs in Aithelar.<br/>If the PCs stay in town more than six nights, they will face three attacks, on different nights. The first will be an attempt to steal their gear by nine were-rats. Then four dopplegangers, hired by a priest in black robes, will try to capture isolated PCs for questioning and eventual sale into slavery, taking their places in the party. Finally, 16 Cult-hired thugs will set wherever the PCs are sleeping afire, waiting with crossbows for any PCs who awaken to emerge</i><br/><br/>What if they want to leave too soon?<br/><br/><i>Ducking Out Of The Adventure<br/>Whether the PCs agree to explore the Wild Wood or not, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no ship will be immediately available for them to sail elsewhere</span>. The Sword may never sail again; if it can be rescued and repaired, weeks of rebuilding will be necessary. If the PCs try to defend it while the crew rebuilds, refusing to go adventuring, the next encounter will happen anyway, at night, on the docks. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the PCs steal or hire one of the ramshackle local fishing-boats, and sail away, a storm will rise</span> (the work of Chauntea? Aany hired crew will think and say so), and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">drive the craft ashore</span><br/></i><br/>----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>You get the idea I hope: most of the module is dedicated to heavy-handed (and ham-fisted) ways to keep players (who don't want to play that adventure) "on the right track". They HAVE to "become heroes saving the isles", even if they don't care and don't want!<br/><br/>This is what passed for "good GMing" for TSR and AD&amp;D2 these times.

The insane number of unique monster sheets, ecological information, maps of lairs, etc. that would be inserted after (say) the owlbear entry made my Monstrous Manual the most useful thing at the table.

It offered optional rules that were labelled usually clearly. <br/><br/>It had awesome settings. Even if they didn't always fit the D&amp;D motif (I love Birthright, Mystara, and Dark Sun, but of the three two of them are better served by other game systems.)<br/><br/>Edit: <br/><br/>I'd also like to point out that most of the railroad stuff flew completely by us as none of us that played in my multiple groups used pre-written adventures.

I'm not sure whether it is a coincidence, but the CRPGs that were based on D&amp;D3e, starting with Neverwinter Nights, were really boring. Much more sanitised, while the old games were at their best when they were throwing really weird items, enemies and spells at you. So for the creators of CRPGs, I'd say that the incoherence of AD&amp;D2e was actually a <i>boon</i>; and it is a medium that allows you to railroad players and have it work, so that even the GM advice was sort of spot on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424054/#Comment_424054" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-11T07:16:31+00:00" title="November 11, 2013  7:16AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2013 7:18AM by VictorGijsbers.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started role playing in 1999 or 2000 with AD&amp;D2e. It was the only game I knew, and the only game the people in my gaming group knew. We never thought about using anything else, because, well, we didn't know anything else.<br/><br/>I loved reading through all the books and thinking about all the adventures you could be having.<br/><br/>Actually playing the game never lived up to that. The system was horrendously complicated and inconsistent, and we house ruled and house ruled, but without really understanding in what ways the system was working against us. Just think about how multiclassing worked, or how exceptional strength worked, or how spell components worked, or how the druid experience progression worked, and so on.<br/><br/>But worse than that was the fact that we actually learned GMing from these books and the GMing advice on internet sites dedicated to AD&amp;D2e. There was a clear wish not to have just dungeon crawls ("role playing, not roll playing"!), as AD&amp;D clearly told us we should be doing; but absolutely no idea on how to achieve this. Illusionism was rampant. So was player boredom and frustration, which meant that we spent most of the time bickering among ourselves, because player vs. player conflicts were the one thing the GM didn't prepare.<br/><br/>The incoherent rules I can live with. The utterly incoherent creative agenda, and the huge gap between the game that was promised and the game that was delivered, is something that caused me years of frustration. So that is why my personal assessment of AD&amp;D2e is very negative.<br/><br/>Though I must admit that it had a certain <i>flavour</i> that seems to be mostly absent from D&amp;D3e, and wholly gone from D&amp;D4e. I've read in the fourth edition books, and it feels like an empty husk. Or rather, it seems to be a nice board game, but the magic of exploring the unknown is lost.<br/><br/>(And, yeah, specialist wizards! The magic schools were actually quite evocative -- no pun intended.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_424075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424075/#Comment_424075" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-11T20:00:20+00:00" title="November 11, 2013  8:00PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> Illusionism was rampant.</blockquote>\nYou say that like it's a bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers" title="VictorGijsbers"><img alt="VictorGijsbers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VictorGijsbers">VictorGijsbers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424083/#Comment_424083" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-12T01:15:01+00:00" title="November 12, 2013  1:15AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You say that like it's a bad thing.</blockquote>\nChange it to "railroading" if that gets the negative aspect across better. The point is that we wanted the players to shape the story, and had no idea how to have that happen. The result was that the GM was unfolding the story while the players contributed what came down to little more than a few bits of colour.

D&amp;D, as most of us know, was a game set up for dungeon exploration - and AD&amp;D 1e was basically Gary's Big Book of Houserules which he presented as rules.  2e was an attempt to move D&amp;D from a game about dungeon exploration to a game the Dragonlance Saga would work in - while remaining entirely backwards compatable.  It was trying to be something in almost direct defiance of its ruleset and this worked ... about as well as you would expect.  They also had very little quality control and were producing an average of around five books per month for D&amp;D (and according to Ryan Dancey <a href="http://insaneangel.com/insaneangel/RPG/Dancey.html" rel="nofollow">never asking the customers what they wanted</a>).<br/><br/>So what was good about 2e?<br/><br/>I'm going to go with the settings.  Planescape in particular.  A lot of depth there - remember they were putting out five books a month, and disparate voices actually deepen settings.<br/><br/>I'm also going to point that the incoherence was often actually a useful thing; it allowed different people to get very different experiences with the same rules set at the same table in a way that's much harder with modern games; the person who wanted the Wizard-with-a-ring-binder-of-spells could have one and the fighter would still fit on one side of A4 and kick ass and take names, and you could play both one-hit-kills at first level and larger than life action heroes at seventh with no problem at all.  Now due to it being incoherent all the way down 2e wasn't good at any of those, but it was <em>good enough</em> at a lot of them at once.  (Something that might be quite useful in one of my current gaming groups where I have two players looking for very different things).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424108/#Comment_424108" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-12T17:59:14+00:00" title="November 12, 2013  5:59PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a big fan of the <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/110324/HR1-HR7-Historical-Reference-Series-%282e%29-%5BBUNDLE%5D?filters=0_0_10020_0_0&amp;manufacturers_id=5034" rel="nofollow">Historical References</a> (the green splatbooks). One of the big shifts in the tone from 1st to 2nd edition was 2nd edition seemed to prioritize the pseudo-medieval thing over the swords-and-sworcery influences.

I mean, the Planescape setting in general is pretty cool, but I'm having difficult deciding what I should quote about it, exactly.<br/><br/>Oh, what the heck - here's a pretty cool thing from Dark Sun, expanded and revised edition (1995):\n<blockquote><br/>DARK SUN campaigns are set in a violent world. Powerful magic and psionics, desperate hordes of raiders, and the unforgiving environment conspire against player characters. This makes death a very real possibility for player characters. To offset this in DARK SUN campaigns, players are encouraged to use character trees. Although they play with only one character at a time, they have four to call upon at the beginning of any particular game session- thus minimizing the time needed to start up a game after a PC\u2019s death.<br/><br/>A character tree consists of one active character (which the player is using as his player character) and three inactive characters. The active character takes part in the adventure, performing actions in the campaign world. When a new adventure begins, the player may switch to one of his inactive characters or keep playing his previously active character.<br/><br/>The character tree\u2019s chief purpose is to give every player a pool of adventurers to choose from for different situations or when one of his characters dies. The player is familiar with these characters and can apply their strengths more readily than he might be able to with freshly created characters. If care is taken, the character tree can be a valuable tool for the player in an extended campaign.<br/><br/>To create a character tree, a player completely rolls up four characters, using the rules presented earlier in this chapter. Once this is done, the player selects the character that he intends to run for the first adventure, making that one his \u201cactive\u201d character. The other three are considered inactive.<br/><br/>The four characters that make up a player\u2019s character tree are unrestricted as to class or race; any combination is acceptable. However, the alignment of these characters is restricted. All of the characters in a character tree must be like-aligned as to good, neutral, or evil. Devotion to chaos or law makes no difference, however. For example, one character tree might have a chaotic-good dwarf gladiator, a lawful good thri-kreen fighter, a neutral-good human bard, and a chaotic-good elf preserver. The thri-kreen couldn\u2019t be lawful evil or even lawful neutral and still be a part of this character tree.<br/><br/>If a character is forced to change alignment so that it no longer fits within the tree, that character must be discarded (or, optionally, the player may discard the other three, inserting three new characters into his tree and adopting this new alignment). Discarded characters should be given to the DM for use as NPCs.</blockquote>\nAfter that the text goes on to describe when you can switch characters (between adventures or after character death, basically), and how the characters in the tree gain xp even while inactive - each time an active character advances, <i>one</i> of your inactive ones advances as well. In general it's a fine compromise for the sort of game AD&amp;D had become at this point. (By compromise I mean, in my games you obviously don't get free xp just for being in a stable, heh heh.)<br/><br/>All in all, this concept from Dark Sun is pretty exciting - it's not perfect (I don't know what that alignment stuff is about, and the limit to specifically four characters seems useless), and it's not entirely original (rather, it's a cool call-back to character stables used in old school D&amp;D), but what is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424192/#Comment_424192" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-14T08:27:36+00:00" title="November 14, 2013  8:27AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an excellent/cool example of what I was looking for, thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424198/#Comment_424198" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-14T10:04:29+00:00" title="November 14, 2013 10:04AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there were a couple of things about 2nd that were good. <br/><br/>1) It was the first time D&amp;D really started to look at diverse campaign worlds. You had Planescape, Spelljammer, Dark Sun, Birthright, Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Al Qadim, The historical guides etc. Not all of those worlds were good mind you, but there was a real variety of options for the first time in D&amp;D. Notably several of these worlds were trying to do something other than Vance/Tolkien western fantasy. <br/><br/>2) By the end of 1st it was a weird maze of sometimes contradictory source books and many of the rules essentially made no sense at all. Negative level cavaliers, weird requirements for being a Bard, Byzantine dual classing requirements, conflicting non weapon proficiency rules from book to book, level caps for non humans, Druids having to duel their superior to advance. Say what you will about play testing and supplement creep, but 2nd Edition cleaned up a lot of messes.<br/><br/>3) In the Kits and the Skills and Powers books it took some baby steps towards the kind of character customization you could get in Rolemaster or other games. It's a step that never really got pursued, but at the time being able to play a Swashbuckler or an Explorer added something to the game. <br/><br/>4) It actually acknowledged life outside the dungeon.

Welcome to the worlds beyond your world, the great wheel of the cosmos. This is a great place! Where else can a poor sod mingle with mighty minions of the great powers, or sail the astral ocean, or visit the flaming courts of the City of Brass, or even battle fiends on their home turf? Hey, welcome to the lands of the living and the dead!</i><br/><br/>So, where to begin? Sigil, of course - there ain't no other place worth beginning. Sigil: the City of Doors.<br/><br/>This town's the gateway to everything and everywhere that matters. Step through one door and enter the halls of Ysgard, or turn down a particular alley and discover the Abyss. There are more gateways in Sigil than can be imagined; with all those doors Sigil's a useful place - and then some.<br/><br/>Want to share a drink with a fiend, or maybe discuss philosophy with a deva? Here it can happen in the same day, the same afternoon, even at the same table - nothing's too unlikely for Sigil. Strange folks abound here, and any one of them may prove ally or foe. Where else but in Sigil do humans, elves, dwarves, githzerai, bariaur, and tieflings form adventuring companies? Where but in Sigil can a well-heeled cutter hire a githyanki ship or a legion of yugoloth mercs? This is the place to live... or die.<br/>No surprise every basher out there wants Sigil! The Cage'd be a pearl for any tanar'ri prince or baatezu lord. 'Course, a few big shots have tried to storm the city, but Sigil's not without her defenses. That birdcage's got more ways to close her doors than folks know about. Then there's the Mazes, nasty little places Sigil makes for would-be dictators. Those that get caught inside go barmy, poor berks - sometimes they scream so much a body can hardly stand it.<br/><br/>But there's a lot more out there than just Sigil. Get outside the city and there's the planes themselves: the throne of the gods, the battleground of the eternal Blood War, and home to more horrors and wonders than ever existed on any prime world. There's enough crusades, exploits, treasures, and mysteries to keep a band of adventurers busy for centuries to come (though why a body'd want to go to some of those places is beyond reasoning). Anyway, all it takes is the right door, so step right through!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424400/#Comment_424400" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T17:53:55+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  5:53PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many trad games talk a good talk, but completely fail in execution - what they told you is revealed to basically be a mix of propaganda and wishful thinking, often written by an entirely different person from the actual game designer. One might say that the authors are fully briefed on what literature looks like, but woefully unprepared to actually implement a game that can match their nice prose. The outcome is that the fictional fluff of your average trad game is often immensely better than the humdrum systemic ideas.<br/><br/>I think that this is the case with that memorable introduction to Planescape; it paints the picture of a game that is experience-oriented and player-directed, with unexpected milieus and untold possibilities just around the corner. However, if you'll look at the actual game materials for Planescape, they are all traditional plotted adventures where you might get to see Arcadia, but only if that's where the influential NPC's quest is taking you via carefully preplotted dimensional doorways. No way are players going to do any choices about which of that multitude of doorways they're going to step through - the material doesn't even include randomizing tools for Sigil destinations, sad as the missed opportunity is.<br/><br/>I mean, I haven't Planescape, but nowhere in the materials did I get any practical procedures that would leave room for hiring a githyanki ship or a legion of yugoloth mercs. Where in the adventure that likely concerns travelling from point A to point B to get a McGuffin is there going to be room for this sort of organic experiencing of Sigil? I don't know, maybe you should just know to play it with a loose leash despite the adventures all pointing the other way.<br/><br/>All this, of course, in the spirit of inquiry - even if I have my misgivings about the history of fluff text in rpgs, the bit Ara chose does a good job capturing the appeal of Planescape. As has been the theme in this thread: 2nd edition AD&amp;D sure did have some ambitious fantasy literature in it, even folks who don't necessarily have any other use for the game can agree to that.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424407/#Comment_424407" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T19:23:03+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  7:23PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you vastly overrate the influence of the modules on the average player.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424408/#Comment_424408" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T19:31:34+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  7:31PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick reminder, please<br/><br/><i>I regret nothing, but I realized that, to this day, I basically know nothing about how 2E works or what it's like to play.

Thought I'd chime in with my 2 c.p.<br/><br/>IMHO, 2E made progress in that characters are more individual (wizard specialty, customized thief skills, NWPs, kits, etc.); there are issues that it retains the same 1E ruleset with its inherently high lethality, and GM advice to keep this down through fudging die rolls as much as carefully tailoring the adventure. The ruleset in general was designed under expectations of near-total backwards compatibility of the kind that mostly seem ridiculous in the modern era, where a D&amp;D edition change is expected to be a ground-up redesign into an entirely different game. <br/><br/>The GM advice that more or less assumes bad players (XP penalties for alignment change on the assumption its just 'bad roleplaying' rather than character development, railroading, etc). I think a lot of it you can put down to the designers assuming a majority of players would be aged about 14 - so that naturally a group will consist of a dwarf fighter who wants to kill everything and refuses to travel anywhere by sea because dwarves hate water, a mysterious hooded guy who refuses to tell anyone their class and steals everything that's not nailed down, a chaotic neutral wizard who insists on making all their decisions by flipping a coin, a hot drow priestess with three 18s played by the GMs girlfriend, and maybe a paladin <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> . <br/><br/>2E does have quite a few toxic ideas which are also more or less par for the course for the era; GM driven stories, illusionism, the idea the rules are fine because you can change them, the 'Stormwind Fallacy' (that picking good options when making a character is directly antithetical to roleplaying), metaplot e.g. in Dragonlance /Dark Sun. To an extent I think it also could be said to encourage cliche-driven RP, low-grade roleplaying as players tried to play mentally challenged or socially dysfunctional PCs, and it has some distinctively strange sorts of characters - like the 'True Neutral' and 'Chaotic Neutral' characters whose alignments were (badly) theoretically derived from the [3x3] alignment matrix idea. On the plus side it should get some points for starting to move D&amp;D outside the dungeon to become a more 'epic fantasy' game, and trying to make the rules at least more clearly written though, I think. <br/>While it was the longest running D&amp;D edition, 2nd Ed. is also in kind of an uncomfortable place because its hated by 3E people for being a disorganized pile of junk subsystems, people of a narrative bent for having bad DMing advice, the more staunchly traditional 0D&amp;D/AD&amp;D players for not being dungeony/Gygaxian enough and having a story/character focus and too much Elmore art, and D&amp;D non-enthusiasts because of the same things as any other D&amp;D edition (classes/levels/hit points). <br/><br/>As time went on I guess even the designers got frustrated with the mechanical holes, and a majority of other systems from TSR were quite different; Gamma World-4 (early on, 1992) was deliberately quite similar, and actually the first Buck Rogers game as well I suppose, but Amazing Engine and Alternity were both drastically different to D&amp;D. Amazing Engine in particular was (more or less as noted from designer notes in one of the Dragon magazines) very much intended to facilititate storytelling by being rules-lite and getting out of the way, in a fashion that AD&amp;D didn't.   <br/><br/>Oh, one other thing - while Ryan Darcey has said he couldn't find much if any surveys or feedback, Dragon <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23124&amp;Mode=like">#124</a> did have this survey (reposted by me under my rpg.net alt) which may be of interest.<br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?621954-Greatest-Ever-D-amp-D-Redesign-Survey" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?621954-Greatest-Ever-D-amp-D-Redesign-Survey</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_424654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424654/#Comment_424654" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T05:11:03+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  5:11AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>2E does have quite a few toxic ideas which are also more or less par for the course for the era; GM driven stories, illusionism, <br/></blockquote>\nThere is a difference between "toxic" and "stuff you don't like".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gnome_Inventor" title="Gnome_Inventor"><img alt="Gnome_Inventor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gnome_Inventor">Gnome_Inventor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424655/#Comment_424655" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T05:54:20+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  5:54AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not in this case <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Seriously though, read my opinion as 'stuff I consider to be toxic' if that makes you happier.

Again, this may not be your ideal game, and maybe you don't play those things, but it is quite clearly a functional and satisfying format for many people.

I mean, there's a lot of talk in the OSR threads these past few weeks, about how OSR games home in on what BX, AD&amp;D 1st Ed., or the white box did best, and winnow out the chaff. And, like, yeah, that's great and I'm into it, but that's a 21st Century sensibility. The design sensibility of the late '80s and the entire '90s was: <i>Let's see how far we can push this puppy.</i> And I think, just in terms of raw ideas, 2nd Edition is a resounding success from beginning to end. I hear you all saying, "They tried to make this system support too much that was too far out of the zone of what D&amp;D does well," and I get that, I really do; but I think it's pretty amazing to turn that around and say, "Holy moly, it's pretty amazing that this game supported <i>all that</i> at all!"---even if it only did it partially.<br/><br/>2nd Edition reeeeally took the game out of the dungeon like no edition before it. It did romance, it did deserts and decadence, it did spacefaring sci-fantasy, it did "dungeon punk" long before the term was coined, it did quasi-historical low fantasy in the greenback series, it did Kung Fu in Dragon Fist.... And everything was designed with a view to giving the players a chance to make almost any character archetype they could imagine (and scores no one would ever have thought up independently), <i>as</i> coherently as the system permitted. They never stopped churning out great ideas that could substantively and fundamentally change the way you play the game; I mean, look at <i>Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic</i> (one of my favourites).<br/><br/>In other words, no, it wasn't perfectly coherent by Indy game standards, BUT it WAS remarkably coherent <i>for what it was</i>, and what was being done with it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424708/#Comment_424708" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T19:30:53+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  7:30PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Romance?</i><br/><br/>Tell me more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424712/#Comment_424712" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T20:35:10+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  8:35PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe Birthright at least had marriage mechanics...but it's been a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424714/#Comment_424714" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T21:03:08+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  9:03PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Especially since (although this was lost on the first page) this is supposed to be about all the GREAT things about AD&amp;D2, and there had to be a lot of them or else people wouldn't have played it so long to such great success, right?

Main game I played through the 90s (along with Palladium) since I didn't like storyteller. We basically never used any of the modules and pretty much ignored the GM advice; PHB + the completes (Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Psionics, in particular) + Tome of Magic + 1E Oriental Adventures occasionally. Varying character generation methods (the GM disliked V), used proficiencies and kits though the GM didn't like kits either. For worlds usually homebrew, though we did a couple of Planescape campaigns and a shared campaign experiment with Spelljammer that didn't quite get off the ground. <br/><br/>I GM'd more or less a one-off of Planescape last year that went across two sessions and was quite fun - the PCs were sent by one of the factions to a ship going through the astral plane to a prison planetoid owned by a rival faction, to free one of their factols. Along the way trouble ensued as a group of githyanki and their red dragon attacked to recapture another githyanki held on the ship, wanted by vlaakith the lich queen for reaching 11th level. The  planetoid itself was matter which came originally from the ethereal plane, brought through the ether cyclone ; it 'wanted' to return, generating a large local gate back there, and left to its own devices would eventually have become the seed for a new Prime Material world (the Doomguard PC was appalled; he also went off and broke the clock tower regulating the planetoid by polymorphing its guardian modron into something). PCs fought some ethereal plane monsters (thought eaters) that'd feebleminded the guy they were sent to rescue and got out. <br/><br/>Lots of good moments playing they game, many aren't especially system-specific though. A few I suppose:<br/>*the overpowered dwarf fighter PC decapitatated by an pirate with a vorpal sword, except that he also had a ring of regeneration...they stick his head back on and he hunts the guy because the blow also cut off part of his beard.<br/>*the 12th level or so game where the party did Dungeon adventure A Rose For Talakara, defeating the evil wizardess of that name (24th level) when she rolled a 1 vs. her own Mass Charm (bounced off someones' Ring of Spell Turning). Spoiled a bit by finding out that shouldn't have worked (area spells can't be turned).<br/>*Red Baron Mk I, someone's fighter who was described as 7ft tall but rolled "1s" for hit points all the way up to 4th level somehow.<br/>*my PC built with both a DIY race (half-nymph) and a DIY class (a 'lone wolf' thief variant)<br/>*my halfling gypsy-bard/psionicist in an online game (GM approved combination) who used Read Languages to read Common due to being illiterate.<br/>*a thief/bard with crazy thief skills in another campaign; the min/maxing here appalled the GM when the character died due to giant crab and he got a look at the character sheet. <br/>*the PC wild mage who generated some very silly combats due to wild surges, including a 'target falls in love with caster' on an evil warlock, a 'switch personalities with target' during a fight with the BBEG (the Witchlord from HeroQuest), and at one stage being polymorphed into a chimera trying to recharge a magic item using Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.<br/>*any number of horrible Deck of Many Things incidents.<br/><br/>Also, the Monster Manual is excellent, with nearly every creature having ecological notes or adventure hooks built in.<br/><br/>There are some things I enjoy about it mostly in hindsight after another 10+ years playing 3E/Pathfinder: multiclassing works better, the rules are often fairly ignoreable (less skill checks getting into everything), and characters with low ability scores are much less gimpy than in 3E. Also while the subsystems are a bit crazy, they do sometimes give less silly results than 3E (half-ogres picking pockets as well as halflings, old people being better at Spot checks, Str checks being only 20% better for the 18 Str character). Psionics is less like a clone of arcane magic, the classes are generally better balanced somehow, characters are more archetypal instead of the winning combinations being fairly strange things appearing emergently from the sea of weird options. If you use the Fighter's Handbook, fighters have quite a few cool tricks available without needing feats to do things in particular, and generally the damage escalation up levels is less so there's more incentive to try cool stunts in combat.<br/><br/>Also, non weapon proficiencies and kits I do really like as a character customization tool; unlike skill-based systems none of the skills are really important/powerful, so that its usually fine to just take stuff that suits the character. Often the way skills don't have defaults or are more specific leave untrained use of NWPs open to a 'rulings not rules' approach that can be interesting. --e.g. say you don't have Survival (jungle) and you're looking for food in the jungle, the GM describes the red berries you find and asks you if you want to eat them, stuff like that. Likewise social interaction usually boils down to 'so what do you say?', maybe a Charisma check - Etiquette is just a fairly specific knowledge of protocol which would help in specific ways rather than resolving a social check completely like Diplomacy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18860/what-was-good-about-ad-d-2nd-edition/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18860/what-was-good-about-ad-d-2nd-edition">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18860/what-was-good-about-ad-d-2nd-edition/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18860/what-was-good-about-ad-d-2nd-edition/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18860%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18860%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
