However, I'm not entirely sure which game I should pick up and get rolling with my group. Thus far I have looked at Dungeon World, FATE Core, and Burning Wheel Gold. <br/><br/>I'm really interested in running a deep, prolific, serious fantasy epic that has an emphasis on the narrative and character development, but I am open to other genres (which is where FATE Core comes in).<br/><br/>Cheers, and thank you in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413381/#Comment_413381" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T08:03:11+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  8:03AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>deep, prolific, serious fantasy epic that has an emphasis on the narrative and character development</blockquote>\nSounds like Burning Wheel to me!

Start with the first 74 pages, and then have players go through Character Burning together, with the intent of starting somewhere and then going on to come up with cool character concepts.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?11796-BWG-Questions&amp;p=132261#post132261" rel="nofollow">This post</a> is actually a really good sum-up of how to adjucate combat without constantly resorting to Fight, which is good--because Fight is only really meant for major combats. It's also harder to get into when you don't have a strong handle on the system.<br/><br/>I'd recommend starting with the core rules (and reading the GM advice at the back), then adding in modules as needed--Duel of Wits may be the easiest to add, rules-wise, and then Fight. I still haven't grokked Range &amp; Cover.<br/><br/>Remember this: <b>failure is fun</b>! It really is. Because failures are explicitly not allowed to be whiffs--you have to use a failure to deepen the story...just in a way that makes things difficult for the characters. A failed Circles test in a game I'm running has introduced a creepy rogue sorcerer into the game, a character I hadn't even envisioned existing until then.<br/><br/>You definitely want BWG for what you're running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413393/#Comment_413393" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T10:04:34+00:00" title="May  2, 2013 10:04AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World might be the best fit overall. It's rather hardcoded to fantasy, but that's where you're starting out. The rules are very approachable, especially as the character sheets and the two-page Moves handout contain most of what the players need to know. If you feel like mixing some SF tropes into your fantasy in the future (as in Burroughs' Mars books or Vance's <i>The Dying Earth</i>), "Dungeon Planet" is a great supplement.<br/><br/>FATE is also a very good system. It's a little heavier weight than Dungeon World but not too much. As a generic system it's not going to have as much setting material, so you'd have to make up more things yourself like monsters and magic items.<br/><br/>I played Burning Wheel (the first edition, not Gold) for about six months a few years ago, and found it too heavyweight for me. It has some very nice features, but there's a lot of bookkeeping for characters to keep track of (especially around experience) and the combat system is pretty complicted, to such a degree that after a few sessions the group agreed to drop it and go with simpler skill tests for fighting.<br/><br/>Some other lightweight fantasy systems you should take a look at are Old School Hack and On Mighty Thews. The first is similar in complexity to Dungeon World but with a bit more crunch to its combat system, and the latter is fun in that it gives the players a whole lot of power to add to the game world by making "lore rolls" that let them declare facts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413395/#Comment_413395" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T10:06:25+00:00" title="May  2, 2013 10:06AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think any of the three you mention will work great, depending on what you and your friends like.

I think, being aware that you're setting both thematic and mechanical expectations, you should make your calls based on that. Realize that when you say "this is like White Wolf games", they're going to bring in a bunch of previous experiences.<br/><br/>In this case, I think I would've advocated the more traditional Monsterhearts pitch: "this is the drama side of Buffy". When building a genre expectation, it makes more sense to use non-RPG fiction (especially because said fiction is usually superior), so that you don't bring in system expectations from a system that's totally differently oriented.<br/><br/>In this case, Burning Wheel offers a few different influences, including LOTR and Wizard of Earthsea.

Absolutely fine. I blazed through the book in a day of fevered reading (skipping through the subsystems on my first go), and sorta kept going through it. For me, it was like studying, except that I had huge motivation to read, because it was so gorram enjoyable to read.<br/><br/>That's a big plus BW has that some games don't--at least for me, the rulebook itself is an actively enjoyable read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413629/#Comment_413629" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T12:18:07+00:00" title="May  6, 2013 12:18PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On bit of advice for BW character burning: either "tell it like a story" to do it in the order of birth to current, letting the Settings lead where they will; or "burn backwards" by finding the final Lifepath you want to achieve, and work backwards through Settings and Leads until you're "Born ___". Lots of beginners try to make a given starting Lifepath lead to a given final Lifepath and spend HOURS grinding through possible intermediary Lifepaths, trying to get the right Prereqs, Leads, Resources, and Traits.<br/><br/>On the flip side: one learns a LOT about the various Settings, doing it the long way.<br/><br/>Another bit of beginning BW advice: minimize PvP squabbling (e.g., Elf v. Dwarf v. Orc) or conflicting Beliefs or Instincts. Save that for your next campaign, when you want to try to push hard at each other's BITs. Trust me: there's enough to do in play and with "normal" conflict (PvE, PvM, PvNPC) to have tons of fun without also trying to manage butthurt between players over setting-implied bullshit.<br/><br/>I'd even go so far as to say "pick one race for the whole party," but no one ever listens to that advice (and, invariably, each chimes in a few weeks later about how "broken" Elves are... or Sorcery... or Faith... or Dwarven arms... etc.).<br/><br/>Burning. Wheel. Is. Not. Balanced. And. Never. Will. Be.<br/><br/>Final advice: Don't make your players pay for shoes if they buy any form of "outfit" or "armor". Seriously--that rule is bullshit. If someone WANTS to put 1 RP into "shoes" then I say they have SHOES, and LOTS of 'em--it's a Thing for them; a shoe for every occasion (and extra pairs for occasions that can damage shoes!).<blockquote></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413639/#Comment_413639" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T15:04:41+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  3:04PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel is a lot to digest no matter who you are.
