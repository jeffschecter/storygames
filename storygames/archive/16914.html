I've played Fiasco many, many times with many different groups of people. Last night, for the first time, I played with a friend who had actually purchased his own copy of the rules and read through it meticulously in preparation. We had a great game (The Ice, with scientist-cultists trying to raise a elder seal god), but it became apparent that I have not been playing the game exactly as written all this time.<br/><br/>The differences were in the Setup. As written, the rules state, fairly clearly, that all plot elements are assigned <i>between</i> two characters, and that by the end of the setup, there should be two plot elements on either side of each player (one relationship, and one need/location/object).<br/><br/>The way I've been playing, the only restriction is that everyone must have ONE relationship (not two). Relationships can be between any two players (not just adjacent players). Needs are assigned specifically to one character, not between two. Locations and Objects "float" in the middle of the table and are open to anyone (like Tilt elements), rather than being assigned between two characters.<br/><br/>It's interesting the subtle differences produced by each version of the setup. As written, the relationship web is very dense and very symmetrical, and I actually found it jarring at first that every player was trying to manage two separate relationships at a time - it required more interpretation to come up with characters that matched my four assigned plot elements. With the "wrong" rules, you tend to end up with more sprawling, asymmetrical webs (perhaps more Tarantino than Coens), often with some more tangential subplots and more minor characters, which sometimes become crucially important and sometimes remain secondary. Characters' personalities and motivations are a bit more clear from the outset, since they are less likely to be torn between different allegiances and needs (although inevitably they become muddled as the story progresses). It certainly isn't game-breaking; every game of Fiasco I've ever played has been narratively satisfying and super fun, and last night's game with the "right" rules was no different, although it did feel a bit more challenging to tie everything together.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was strange and fascinating to play such a familiar game a little differently. I don't really know how it happened to begin with - I'm pretty certain the person who taught me the game was playing the "wrong" way also, and every other game I've ever played has used the "wrong" rules! Is this a thing? Has anyone else been playing Fiasco wrong?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385359/#Comment_385359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T11:30:37+00:00" title="July 18, 2012 11:30AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your particular heresy sounds pretty fun. Attaching stuff directly to relationships is really there to make sure you always have something to latch onto when framing a scene. "X is important to Y, let's explore that". But obviously you can do it differently.<br/><br/>I see a lot of people do weird things with the dice ("OK, negative outcome, roll to see how bad!"), or abuse the Aftermath ("black is bad and white is good!"), or try to play with more than five people (seriously, why?) and that can reduce the overall fun. <br/><br/>I don't play as-written very often myself - typically I play "convention style" by explicitly building all the relationships first, and then adding objects, needs and locations once the relationships are set. This is a very efficient way to do the setup but it strips away certain interesting opportunities. I have also been known to skip the die-allocation denouement in the Aftermath and to straight-up reroll the setup dice if I get a clunky distribution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385363/#Comment_385363" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T12:02:32+00:00" title="July 18, 2012 12:02PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played with six people, but with the "wrong" rules, and I think in some ways the "wrong" rules as described above are more conducive to larger groups, since you don't end up with a ridiculously complex and dense web as you would with the as-written rules. I've heard you say before that three is the optimal number for Fiasco, and with the rules as-written I think that's accurate - we had five people last night, and there were a couple of moments were it wasn't clear if we'd be able to tie all our threads back together (we did, of course, and that's a testament to how well the Aftermath works).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385365/#Comment_385365" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T12:06:13+00:00" title="July 18, 2012 12:06PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played at cons with people who insert extra steps in the set-up, like "we've completed the set-up, now let's decide who is going to play which characters" and "lets think up a few NPCs that anyone can bring into a scene, and put them into the middle of the table for anyone to use."<br/><br/>It was clear they were employing advice of the "here are some things you can do to improve Any game" variety, and applying the advice to Every game they play.  (They may have even learned the techniques here at S-G).<br/><br/>The changes never broke the game and may even have helped slightly; but they did undo some of the smart things built into the game. For example, it was always the person officially 'running' the game at the con-- who imposed the changes.  The more of their own variations they impose, the more they establish a GM-fiat role for themselves; by giving one player "No, we're doing it This Way" veto powers and no explicit limit on them.     <br/><br/>I only felt an urge to object once... as I recall, guy 'running the game' wanted to assign a Need to every Relationship, to make sure there would be enough dramatic tension.  Two Needs per character, Plus 2 Relationships, Plus a Location or Object on each Left &amp; Right... seemed to me like too many ingredients in the pot, to me.     I said that might not be a good idea, and the other players unified into "that's how we do it" defensiveness.  I realized they were "a group" bringing their homebrew culture of "he's our leader/No matter what we play" out in public.  And I had obviously outed myself as Just Making Trouble For No Good Reason (Rules Lawyer!).   I think the leader said "Fiasco is a short game, let's just do it this way &amp; maybe we'll have time to run a 2nd session your way."   The mutual distrust quickly faded &amp; the game went well.  I can't recall whether all the elements were actually used in play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385367/#Comment_385367" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T12:29:27+00:00" title="July 18, 2012 12:29PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2012 12:30PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Four is the sweet spot.

Short list:<br/>-- SETUP: Only one Rel per PC; Objects, Locs not attached to Rels; Needs attached to PCs. The "Parker Liberty Setup".<br/>-- SETUP: Black dice = Category; white dice = line items in chosen black-die Categories. The "Artman Literalism Setup": remember how I thought this was RAW, and that made y'all change the template from black dice to enumerate the Category numbers? Well I still think it's an interesting additional constraint, and it would almost certainly speed setup to have fewer options to stare at.)<br/>-- SCENE: Roll scene resolution die to determine how good or bad it resolved; keep that value, instead of re-rolling them for  the Tilt dice math. The "[Someone Thought Of It] Determinism". (Was this me, too?)<br/>-- TILT: Dice *number* determines "hi black" and "hi white", not rolling all and doing dice math.
