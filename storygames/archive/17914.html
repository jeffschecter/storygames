I'm interested in mechanics that formalize the implicit rule that many groups follow of "your character can't die unless it's dramatically appropriate" or "your character can't die unless you want them to".<br/><br/>Let's say your character is trying to do something. Cliched example, you want to save a princess from a necromancer. Now, you use whatever game mechanics apply to resolve the conflict against the necromancer, but your character cannot lose their life to the conflict. You can have some terrible consequence happen to you (the princess is taken away, you're presumed dead and your items are stolen, you come back to life but are in debt to a demon, etc.) but there will always be some narrative back door so that your story doesn't end. So far so ordinary, I'm pretty sure this is the basis for many playstyles.<br/><br/>My idea is that you can deliberately give up your 'plot armour' to get a better chance of success. You are saying, literally or figuratively, that you will give your life to defend the princess. This gives you a big bonus to the resolution mechanic, but it means that if you do fail, then you can (potentially) get killed off for keeps. So you have to think seriously, in- and out-of-character, about what matters to you so much that you will risk your life to defend it.<br/><br/>If the game was built around this concept, you could actually extend it to any asset that can be permanently taken away from the character. Maybe you won't wager your life but you'll wager your ancestral sword. Maybe you turn the situation on its head and you're actually using the princess as bait (wagering the life of an NPC asset) to defeat the necromancer. If you don't wager anything, you have zero chance of success in any conflict.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405318/#Comment_405318" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-02T23:27:08+00:00" title="February  2, 2013 11:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Death's Door</i> by James Brown.

Absolute plot armour is actually pretty uncommon, although games that allow a player to explicitly trade it for something are a slight bit more exclusive. Still, lots of examples:<br/><br/>In <i>Trollbabe</i> you roll first to find out what happens, sans injury or danger to your own character. If you're unhappy with the result, you can reroll, but then your own character gets injured. You can keep rerolling, but after the third reroll or so you're either going to die, or win a pyrrhic victory.<br/><br/>In the <i>Solar System</i> / <i>TSoY</i> you can take the conflict resolution, or extend the conflict if you didn't like the result. In the latter case we go into a round-by-round detailed subsystem reminiscent of traditional RPG combat. Players always have the option of letting the opposing intent stand, getting out with what they've got left, but if they insist on pushing, they definitely can get killed over the issue at hand.<br/><br/>In <i>Dust Devils</i> conflicts begin from this point: both sides know that conflicts are stupid and dangerous, and they'd rather not do it if they can avoid it. But if neither side backs down on bluster, the cards are drawn and the players bluff a bit more about how deadly their hands are. At this point a player can pay to get out of the conflict alive, but if they won't, then the cards are shown, and it's entirely possible that you'll get killed.<br/><br/>What all those examples have in common is the idea that players can draw on more resources for victory if they're willing to let their character get hurt to varying degrees. This notion goes well with narrativist design ideals, as we generally desire the game to focus on character-important stuff. If a player is not willing to risk anything for victory, then apparently it wasn't that important for him to win to begin with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405346/#Comment_405346" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-03T15:40:20+00:00" title="February  3, 2013  3:40PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add to Eero, I'd bring up <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>'s escalation system.  <br/><br/>You start off talking.

Dogs in the Vineyard is a great example, in that it makes putting your character's life on the line absolutely explicit (you know exactly what the risk is at any given moment, since you have to Take the Blow on certain Raises in order to risk death and collect Fallout dice). You will only ever die in that game when you've decided to make it a possibility for your character.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, Dogs has a separate roll for the death thing, so it's not settled until after the conflict is over. This seems to work pretty well, in counterpoint to <a href="/forums/profile/Callan_S%27s">@Callan_S's</a> otherwise good point.)<br/><br/>Lots of other games had similar rules (like Blackout, sadly unpublished, where you decide which Traits are at risk in any given conflict, and one of your Traits is "Your Life"). <br/><br/>This also happens implicitly in any stake-setting games (since, generally setting death stakes will be consensus) and explicitly in any Otherkind-dice derived game. Absent truly unlikely die rolls, you only die if you choose it's important enough to you. (i.e. You choose to assign a high die to your Goal instead of using it to prevent your death.)<br/><br/>Some games draw more of a vague line, though: for instance, Apocalypse World asks, rather, "Is it worth it to survive this as a cripple (i.e. with a debility), or would you rather just die and let it go?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405438/#Comment_405438" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T00:03:02+00:00" title="February  5, 2013 12:03AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel, when you spend your last Persona point.<br/><br/>BTW, you guys are kind of wrong about Dogs.

In another nice touch, healing the Dead Box is harder than any other wound, because your character is resigned to his/her own death.  In fact, Buddhist healing magic can't heal ANY damage on a character with their Dead Box filled, because it can't defy that kind of karma.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405452/#Comment_405452" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T06:25:36+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  6:25AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2013 7:13AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>BTW, you guys are kind of wrong about Dogs.

When you take damage, you can split it up any way you please between Vitality or wound boxes (each wound box is worth 1 point of damage, except the Dead Box which can absorb any amount).  And as previously stated, the game has a reverse death spiral so you get bonuses for checking off wound boxes instead of penalties.<br/><br/>When you run out of Vitality, you're out of the fight.  Maybe not literally unconscious (and definitely not dead or at risk of dying unless your Dead Box is checked), but you are powerless to affect the scene.  Vitality basically totally refreshes between combats, but wound boxes need actual medical assistance or or magic to get rid of (which means taking wounds now reduces your ability to participate in later fights, even if it doesn't bring you closer to death).<br/><br/>So by taking Wounds instead of just Vitality, you are making the fictional statement "my character is invested enough in this fight to take grievous wounds to win", and mechanically rewarded for doing so by getting bonuses (a la Bruce Lee licking the blood off his face and getting extra motivated).  The Dead Box is the ultimate expression of that-- it has the highest wound bonus, but it also means you and your character are willing to risk being removed from the game rather than get removed from the fight; if you run out of Vitality when your Dead Box is checked, that is when you die. (and since the Dead Box can absorb any amount of incoming damage, if you're up against something totally out of your league you can either accept defeat gracefully by just losing all your Vitality, or make one of those romantic doomed stands samurai fiction so loves by checking off the Dead Box instead.  Or less romantically, it's an "oops, didn't mean to do that" switch if you or the GM just miscalculated the level of opposition)<br/><br/>On the other hand, the issue of "what exactly motivates characters enough to risk their lives" is also handled in detail by the Fate system and cycle of Karma, but that's a post for another day.  Suffice it to say that Tenra is super Buddhist, and attachment to the things of this material world is unavoidable but potentially disastrous.<br/><br/>All that and giant robots, demon-summoners, and super-spy technopriests too!  Tenra's a great game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405654/#Comment_405654" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T09:27:48+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  9:27AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep reading this topic as "Game mechanics you would give your life for?".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
