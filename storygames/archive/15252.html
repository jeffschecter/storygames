I'm thinking along the lines of "System matters" which I interpret as using the rules themselves to create this flow of events rather than rely on the GM to force it to happen or (even harder) force the players to do it for themselves. <br/><br/>Here is a quote from the wikipedia page on Script Writing Theories. <br/><br/>Syd Field's Paradigm: Screenwriting guru Syd Field wrote the seminal book Screenplay, and posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in Aristotle's Three Acts divided into four pieces.<br/><br/>Field also introduced the idea of Plot Points into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:<br/><br/>Opening Image: The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.<br/><br/>Inciting Incident: Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.<br/><br/>Plot Point 1: The last scene in Act One, Turning Point One is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In Star Wars, this is when Luke's family is killed by the Empire. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the Rebels in opposing Darth Vader.<br/><br/>Pinch 1: A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in Star Wars, Pinch 1 is the Stormtroopers attacking the Millennium Falcon in Mos Eisley, reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the Death Star R2-D2 is carrying and Luke and Ben Kenobi are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).<br/><br/>Midpoint: An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.<br/><br/>Pinch 2: Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In Star Wars, Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the Princess in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack motif unifies both Pinches.<br/><br/>Plot Point 2: A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Turning Point Two is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in Toy Story, it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.<br/><br/>Showdown: About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.<br/><br/>Resolution: The issues of the story are resolved.<br/><br/>Tag: An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as denouement. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346544/#Comment_346544" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T12:44:59+00:00" title="October 20, 2011 12:44PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played it, but I think Rob Bohl's <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> has some movie-style plot structuring in it.

The result is my current project, Silver Screen Dreams. Syd Feild gives a good overview of the three act structure and the differences between a scene and sequence, but I found it to be almost useless for game design..I've read Hamlet's Hitpoints, and it is presented as a method to analyze where your story had been, in  a dramatic sense, in hopes of helping the GM to direct the action to where it should be. I'm looking forward to how the Dramasystem turns out with this train of thought, but I didn't find it of much help to me.<br/><br/>The best help I found was in a book called "Save the Cat" by the late Blake Snyder. Is he a great screenwriter? No, not really. He's best known for the Stallone flop, "Don't Move, or My Mother Will Shoot!" Most of the scripts he wrote were done, "on spec" and were never produced. However, he nailed the Hollywood Formula. Surprisingly, the formula seems to show up best in bad writing. Snyder broke down just about every Hollywood Movie into <a href="http://gideonsway.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/save-the-snyder-the-blake-snyder-beat-sheet/" rel="nofollow">15 Plot Points or Beats</a> Just look them over and you'll never be able to look at a movie the same way again. I found this helpful because it provides a roadmap on how a story should go to get that Hollywood Feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346622/#Comment_346622" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T15:47:49+00:00" title="October 21, 2011  3:47PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Screen/Novel writing theory was one of the places I turned when I wanted my play to become more story like.

(For my money the best stuff I've read were Dwight Swain's books, and Anne Lamont.)  I still read writing books because I find them interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is.  At least for me I discovered that most Screen/Novel/Story theory was an analytic structure to be applied after you had already sort of spit out your first draft.  It helped you see things, tighten stuff up, look for holes and weak spots.  I'm not saying that there's nothing to be learned from it, but it seems to me that the best place to apply those structural tools occurs after where most rpg's end.
