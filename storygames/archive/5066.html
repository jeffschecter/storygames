I am of the camp that some games should be trying to evoke certain types of experiences and when that is the case it is often helpful for a system to be linked to key setting elements.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm curious about is how explicit have game developers with tightly linked systems and settings been in describing the critical setting elements which make the game work?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example I have seen a lot of posts about TSOY and how a lot of the setting can be set aside, but how it is key that there not be 'monsters and gods'.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for insight as to how to tease apart these systems from the details of their settings without disturbing important features as well as clues regarding how to explain these intricacies to others.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114312/#Comment_114312" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T07:53:27+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  7:53AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2007 12:55PM by chearns.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mothlos</cite>As an example I have seen a lot of posts about TSOY and how a lot of the setting can be set aside, but how it is key that there not be 'monsters and gods'.</blockquote>\nClinton explains that aspect here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4584#Item_14" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4584#Item_14</a><br/><br/>Now it comes on the tail end of two or three other threads I think, so it may be hard to understand out of context, but that was his answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114331/#Comment_114331" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T08:37:43+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  8:37AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2007 1:05PM by Andy.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found my little essay on the No Gods No Monsters for TSOY as well, here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4538#Item_34" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4538#Item_34</a><br/><br/>That's specific to TSOY, though.  Clinton wanted a particular kind of experience from his game, and so its wired so that it delivers. I think I tackle the intricacies and problems of pulling them apart with TSOY in that thread above. For other games, though, you might want to ask about each individual game and we can try to break it down from there.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114334/#Comment_114334" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T08:46:24+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  8:46AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to think that indie systems, approaching a smaller-scale setting, are effectively codifying a particular play experience.<br/><br/>For experience, Dogs in the Vineyard is about Mormon cowpolks to ride in to Save The Day. The system, with its' establishment of relationships and intertwined personal achievement and history, has effectively codified a system where a group of individuals work together from a common goal set, ostensibly to help those attached to the same goal set.<br/><br/>Once you abstract the play model, the system is about travellers protecting and policing those of similar beliefs. Even unpacking that, though, you could imagine a Jedge Dredd hack where no one believes your madness, or a Deep Space Nine hack where those in need come to you. To me, it's all about what you want to achieve, and finding mechanics to reinforce your story style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
