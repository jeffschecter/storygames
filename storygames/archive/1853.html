                            I was thinking about this! Here's a few<br/><br/>Truman Capote, <b>In Cold Blood</b>. Lots of Capote attention nowadays thanks to the films but you really have to go and read the book because it is so damn good.<br/>Geoff Dyer, <b>Out of Sheer Rage</b>. A book that keeps threatening to be a biography of DH Laurence but never really gets there. It both pissed me off, because Dyer is so damn cynical, and knocked me over with absolutely incandescent writing. And you do learn about Laurence in the process.<br/>Dwight MacDonald - <b>Against the American Grain</b>. I was recommended McDonald as an antidote to the 'Orwell is the peerless 20th essayist' canard and good gracious is this a masterclass in clear, arresting writing. I don't agree with everything he says (he's a high-culture conservative, with all that brings) but who else would get me to read an essay on a new (then, old now) reissue of an Encyclopedia and enjoy it? I write better english thanks to ole Macdonald.<br/>Keith Johnstone, <b>Impro</b>. Hello? Hello??? Read it please.<br/>Simon Singh, <b>Fermat's Last Theorum</b>. This makes a story out of math in such a cool way - it's a historical romp (including letters defiantly written awaiting the guillotine), a classical enquiry, an account of challenge and loss. Plus, math making sense.                        </div>

                            Yay, nonfiction!<br/><br/><i>Ti Ping Tien Kwoh: The History of the Tiping Revolution Including A Narrative of the Author's Personal Adventures by Augustus Lindley (Lin Le), formerly Honorary Officer, Chung-Wang's Guards; Special Agent of the Ti-Ping General-in-Chief; and Late Commander of the "Loyal and Faithful Auxiliary Legion"</i> (1866) -- a former British naval officer describes running goods and fighting pirates while assisting in China's pseudo-Christian Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864), including long tracts where he gives his own government hell for supporting the corrupt imperial government over their fellow Christians. Beijing Foreign Language Press just came out with a 2-volume hardcover slipcase edition with the original full color illustrations and a replica of Lindley's commission from the one of the head rebel generals.  Holy crap is this an amazing piece of work.<br/><br/>Steven Mithen's <i>After The Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000 - 5,000 BC</i> (2003) -- A terrific account of post-Ice Age humanity for the lay reader. Mithen creates an imaginary literary persona, John Lubbock, and describes him wandering around thousands of years ago.  A great account of where we all came from and of hunter-gatherer and early agricultural societies in general.<br/><br/>Christopher Dewdney's <i>Acquainted With The Night: Excursions Through the World After Dark</i> (2004) follows the hours from dusk until dawn, describing different aspects of nocturnal existence, from bats to ladies of the night to dreaming to lunacy.<br/><br/><i>The Book of the Cosmos: Imagining the Universe from Heraclitus to Hawking</i>, edited by Dennis Richard Danielson (2000), is a collection of short historical papers on cosmology. From the earliest discussions of the music of the spheres to modern discussions of dark matter and black holes, all by renowned thinkers and scientists.<br/><br/>I'd suggest a good overview of contemporary China or contemporary Chinese religion, but there really isn't one.                        </div>

<b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b> by Bill Bryson.  A great book popularizing the last, say, 300 years of scientific development, explaining pretty much how the modern view of the world got to be this way.  Long, but extremely readable and entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
A second vote for <b>A Distant Mirror</b> by Barbara Tuchman.  I also liked the <b>Life in a Medieval _______</b> series by Gies, but I wouldn't claim it's essential.<br/>
<br/>
<b>King Leopold's Ghost</b> by Shields, is a pretty good history of the Dutch committing genocide in the Congo.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tomorrow We Wish to Inform You that We Will Be Killed Along with our Familes</b> by Philip Gourevitch, is a pretty good account of the genocide in Rwanda.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</b> by Richard Feynman.  He's awesome!  <b>QED</b> is one of the more presentable works on quantum mechanics, too.  I've heard that the Fundamental Character of Physical Law is good too, but haven't read it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Duty of Genius</b> by Ray Monk is a pretty good biography of Wittgenstein.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, though, I don't read very much non-fiction.  That's probably about it, over the last ten years or so.                        </div>

                            Jeez, how could I have forgotten <b>Godel Escher Bach</b> by Douglas Hofstadter?  It's about artificial intelligence, and is about 30 years old now, so maybe the technical side is dated.  But it's great, great, great.  It reminds me of those "Tomes of Intelligence" in D&amp;D, where you read it and your Int score gets boosted, permanently.                        </div>

<i>Hope Against Hope</i>, by Nadezhda Mandelstam. The wife of Russian poet Osip Mandelstam writing about the years directly preceding and surrounding her husband's imprisonment, mysterious release, re-imprisonment and eventual death in a Siberian labour camp. The title is a pun on the meaning of the author's name (Nadezhda = 'Hope', approx.) Osip Mandelstam is an incredible poet, but this book is easily as illuminating as his poetry, especially to a non-Russian reader like myself -- I haven't read a ton of Russian history, but nothing else seems to come close to explaining what it was like to live as an artist in Stalinist Russia.<br><br><i>Essays</i>, George Orwell. <i>1984</i> sucks, but that doesn't mean Orwell isn't worth reading. It's all about the essays.<br><br><i>Fearful Symmetry</i>, Northrop Frye. The first serious literary criticism of William Blake, and in my opinion more enjoyable than actually reading most of Blake's poetry. Blake's symbolism and philosophy -- often confused for or passed off as 'mysticism' by scholars and readers alike -- are explained and elaborated, and it turns out that they're completely fascinating. Angels and Devils -- and not the kind you know -- engage in a war to remind human beings that they themselves are the only true God, fallen from Eden through the denial of Imagination. "Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead"!                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<i>Seconding:</i> Freakonomics is fun, and I would recommend checking both the generally warm discussion of it on Crooked Timber and Daniel Davies rather more critical treatment on his own blog (I'll fish up links in a bit). BTW, Crooked Timber also have a 'book event' on china mieville. That Shakespeare book I bought for my aunt's birthday! And the Feynman book.<br/><br/>EDIT: Here are the links to the Freakonomics stuff. <br/><a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/category/levitt-seminar" rel="nofollow">Crooked Timber Commentary</a><br/><a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2005_11_27_d-squareddigest_archive.html#113336769665072876" rel="nofollow">Dsquared Part 1</a><br/><a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2005_11_27_d-squareddigest_archive.html#113354352719336579" rel="nofollow">D^2 Addendum a</a><br/><a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2005_12_04_d-squareddigest_archive.html#113414957422113225" rel="nofollow">D^2 Addendum B</a><br/><a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2006_03_19_d-squareddigest_archive.html#114315195116297548" rel="nofollow">D^2 Part 2</a><br/><br/>Other stuff:<br/>Scott Plous, <b>The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making</b> - the most fun required read on my undergrad list, and relevant to people who want to deal with perceptions of risk/probability, so many folk here.<br/><br/>William Goldmanâ€™s <b>Adventures in the Screen Trade</b> is a wonderful romp through Hollywood from the perspective of the screenwriter. Heâ€™s a funny guy who knows a lot, and part of the book is taking one of his stories and making a script out of it, then pulling it apart. A cool little exercise!<br/><br/>Mariane Satrapi's <b>Persepolis</b> is an account of her childhood in Iran told in comic form. Itâ€™s fantastic.<br/><br/>Paul Broks, <b>Into the Silent Land</b>. This is the book I had envisioned myself writing about neuropsychology one day, but heâ€™s gone and written it and done it much much better. Broks, a clinical neuropsychologist, manages to take you inside the narrowed or altered realities of patients with brain damage, then push you at arms length and make you realise how authentically alien such a state of experience would be. He does this by combining anecdote with clinical judgment and scientific findings in a very distinctive but fluid way. Some of the philosophical depths the book delves are wondrous, and the passage on Robert Louis Stevenson and creation in dreams has permanently changed my thinking.<br/><br/>Tom Stafford &amp; Matt Webb, <b>Mind Hacks</b> (disclosure: I was one of the main non-editorial contributors) is a really neat pot pourri of one hundred neuroscience findings that you can try out on yourself, together with ideas of how this science might be used practically, from website visual design to emoticons, detectives detecting lies to using a favorite coffee mug. Interestingly, I just stumbled across a piece on the science behind being made upset by reading negative things, even if they are about or from sources you donâ€™t know; a few people have talked about the damaging effects of toxic internet discourse, so this might interest them.                        </div>

<b>The Rape of Nanking </b>is a very important book, as much as because it tells what actually happened in China in WWII as that almost no-one knows about it; I read it in conjunction with another book called <b>Building Japan</b>, simply because as a country the Japanese have always been an enigma to me. from this I realised that a) they have a history quite unlike most other countries; the sudden and overwhelming influx of other cultures, the seeking of a new way to validate themselves, the manipulation by their government and finally the manipulations from other governments, all in less than 100 years... I mean, there were people around during World War II who still remembered old feudal Japan! And b) the fact that even the Japanese know very little about what happened in Nanking, and no-one else wants to bring it up. It is pretty universally acknowledged that WWII started in 1939, but for Asia it was several years earlier. No history books I ever read even mention Nanking (now known as Nanjing, I believe), or the unspecified hundreds of thousands of people who died there.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was amazing, and I'm much more together about Japan, and of course China, because of it.<br/><br/><b>The Making of Psycho </b>was fantastic. The screenwriter actually couldn't look himself in the face after he was done.<br/><br/><b>The Cartoon History of Time </b>from the same woman who does the cartoons in the New Scientist; explains high-level Hawkins physics with the aid of dancing sheep and Liza Minelli. Classic, funny <i>and</i> informative. We could all learn a thing or 2 from this one.                        </div>

                            Alex F., you remind me with your mention of Paul Broks of the (to me) wonderful Oliver Sacks. He wrote the book <i>Awakenings</i>, on which the film of the same name was based, but has written a number of others including the wonderfully titled <i>An Anthropologist on Mars</i> and <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>. He comes across to me as a skilled and empathetic doctor who is interested in the neurological patients he treats because he finds them fascinating and wonderful <i>people</i>. The books generate a "there are so many different ways to experience being human, and many of them are wonderful" vibe.                        </div>

<blockquote><strong>King Leopold's Ghost</strong>by Shields, is a pretty good history of the Dutch committing genocide in the Congo.</blockquote>
Belgians, it is indeed a truly excellent book that is well worth reading, but it's the Belgians who committed genocide and whom it talks about.                        </div>

                            Ah, right.  The Belgians.  That was my initial thought, and then I was like, "Wait, I always get those countries in there confused.  But I'd better not look it up, because I have a train to catch."  In my defense, I read it when it first came out years and years ago, and my memory isn't what it was.<br/>

And I second all the stuff about Oliver Sacks.                        </div>

                            First, a few "yeah, I agree" comments.<br><br>Yes, <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em> is pretentious, but it also a great, interesting read on a valuable topic.<br/><br/>Jared Diamond's books <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em> and <em>Collapse</em> are essential to anyone who gives a hoot about verisimilitude in setting. The former is a bit more enjoyable, but the latter is probably a bit more relevant to the sort of settings that RPG designers are interested in. Screw it, read 'em both. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>Goldman's <em>Adventures in the Screen Trade</em> is a barrel of monkeys wrapped inside some great commentary about how to create an engaging story. The sequel, <em>Which Lie Did I Tell</em> was more fun for me, simply because I was familiar with more of the movies he talks about.<br/><br/><em>Fermat's Last Theorem</em> is amazingly interesting, since the story of how a mathematical mystery was solved seems like it should be dry as a bone. SImon Singh is just an amazing storyteller, though. His book on cryptography, <em>The Code Book</em>, is also great, but probably not useful to RPG design or play.<br/><br/>As for original recommendation....<br/><br/>Anyone designing a contemporary spy game that hasn't read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spy-Catcher-Autobiography-Intelligence-Officer/dp/0670820555/sr=1-1/qid=1164309704/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-6337693-8459625?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Spycatcher</a> by Peter Wright is just hurting themselves. There's a lot of great non-fiction about the worldwide intelligence community, but this is the best one. Robert Baer's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/See-No-Evil-Soldier-Terrorism/dp/140004684X/sr=1-1/qid=1164309747/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-6337693-8459625?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">See No Evil</a> and James Bamford's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Body-Secrets-Ultra-Secret-National-Security/dp/0385499086/sr=1-2/qid=1164309459/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/105-6337693-8459625?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Body of Secrets</a> (possibly in conjunction with the older <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Puzzle-Palace-Americas-Intelligence-Organization/dp/0140067485/sr=1-3/qid=1164309459/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/105-6337693-8459625?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">The Puzzle Palace</a>) are also very important.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Presidents-Men-Bob-Woodward/dp/0671894412/sr=1-1/qid=1164309842/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-6337693-8459625?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">All the President's Men</a> is the story of how Bob Woodward (in his pre-sellout days) and Carl Bernstein brought down Richard Nixon, from the horses' mouths.Sounds like it should be boring a hell, but it's one of the most interesting books I've ever read.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/DREAMS-OUR-STUFF-MADE-Conquered/dp/0684859785/sr=1-8/qid=1164309984/ref=sr_1_8/105-6337693-8459625?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">The Dreams Our Stuff is Made of</a> by Thomas Disch.

                            Anybody interested in the Middle Ages should read Marc Bloch's <i>Feudal Society</i>. Also Huizinga's <i>The Waning of the Middle Ages</i>.<br/><br/>If you can get hold of it, <i>The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World</i>, by G.E.M. De Ste Croix, is a giant Marxist analysis of ancient society. And if you're at all inclined to head along that path, I always think you should have a stab at Marx's <i>Capital</i> (Vol.1 for starters).                        </div>
