I haven't done a 24-hour one yet, and my entry for Murderland took almost too long even for that contest. I think I came up with a good idea, but I had no real plan on how to approach the project.

Mine is something like this. Start thinking at midday the previous day. Wander around while the concept develops in my head. Start writing at about three o'clock. Have a draft finished by the evening. Take a break, edit the draft a little later. Go to sleep, wake up, go through the draft again in the morning and be done by midday.<br/><br/>Others just write, writing up until the deadline.

I started writing 12 hours in , and most of the time involved was still thinking. My game was only 3500words or so, but 28 pages. <br/><br/>I spent some time on layout/font/images which were pleasant distractions but still kept me in the mindspace of the game.  I had more more or less decided the night before (a little bit after 9) to stick to a simple roll under system. <br/><br/>It didn't stay simple for so long ...<br/><br/>either way, the best way to do it, I think is to avoid over planing and worrying. Also write down not up. I started with an outline of like 300 words, basically just section titles, and went from there and I think that saved me alot of pain, by preventing me from wasting time/words on bad sections and giving perspect as i want along. <br/><br/>Help that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214647/#Comment_214647" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T05:22:04+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  5:22AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I write a game.

He has a personal grudge against the protagonists, or at least seems to.<br/>4) Bickering and conflict between protagonists, due to the tensions resulting from above adversity<br/>5) Violence carried out in an absurd manner and/or with absurd results<br/></i><br/><br/>Then I started designing a system that would do that.

And you are always going to have a prototype system (or more than one) based on your experiences and personal taste (even if it's a negative prototype - what you don't want to do). So unless you expect the only people to do the contest are those who have never even heard of roleplaying games before - or unless you plan on giving yourself electro-shock therapy before you begin in order to get a nice blank slate to start with - then you're already following the steps I've talked about - you're just doing it badly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215130/#Comment_215130" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T14:28:52+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  2:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I write a game.

Generally, anything I've designed, the actual design portion is a really short flurry of thoughts and fitting mechanics together and coming up with cool avenues for play to explore.  Two hours or so, typically.  Then the rest of the contest time is spent trying to take my initial notes and make them into something understandable by someone who isn't me.  The difference between 24 hours and two weeks isn't in the time spent designing as it is in the time spent clarifying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
