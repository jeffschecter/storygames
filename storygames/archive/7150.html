Sad, but true. I've read an awful lot about the hobby, but I've yet to become involved in any sort of actual play. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest question I have for players is what person you use when you respond in roleplay? First or third? My natural instinct seems to be third person - I am more interested in telling a story and reacting to the other players, than embodying my character. Yet it seems that the default pronoun is "I."<br/>\n<br/>\nI've tried researching this myself, but all I've come up with is an article on RPGnet:<br/>\nhttp://www.rpg.net/columns/nextlevel/nextlevel16.phtml<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think the article particularly hits on my point though - I think my natural preference for third person might be that I come heavily from a literature perspective, and most of my writing has been done in third person. I'd want to be involved with the creation of the story just as much as anyone else. Since I don't have an acting or theatrical background either, I don't know how satisfied I'd be with myself "taking on" the role of a character that is completely unlike me (and I'd love to create fictional people that are nothing like me!) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what are the drawbacks and perks of using the particular pronouns? Which do you prefer, and for what reasons?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159082/#Comment_159082" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T08:54:23+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  8:54AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Christine,<br/><br/>I think one of the really cool quirks about roleplaying games is that it feels absolutely natural to switch between these as tone and situation fits. If I'm in a scene where my arch-nemesis just poisoned my daughter and she's in her dying seconds, I'll most definitely be using "I". If I'm storming down  said nemesis' corridor, fighting his henchmen as they show up, I'll be more likely to use third person.<br/><br/>I think you use first person more often when you are confident of your credibility, as well.<br/><br/>Where do you live?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159084/#Comment_159084" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T08:59:23+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  8:59AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Christine, and welcome to Story Games!   I hope you get a chance to play some games soon, because that will definitely inform this conversation.<br/><br/>From my perspective, person varies according to circumstances.  I think first person is way more common as an "in character" voice.  A game like <i>Prime Time Adventures </i>offers many opportunities for describing scenes very broadly, from an audience's point of view, and I find a lot of third-person going on.  So it depends.<br/><br/>One disadvantage with third person, for me, is that you can't really interact in it, at least not in a natural way.  If I want my character to talk to the (imaginary) Dean of Students, first person is direct and conversational.  It feels comfortable, because we do it all the time anyway.  Acting skills don't really enter into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159088/#Comment_159088" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T09:03:10+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  9:03AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't Walk in Winter Wood has the player and the GM describe everything in third person past tense.

I find that I use third person early in a scene, or early in an evening, sort of warming up. And then later on first person becomes more common.  Of course there are some games that push a certain method. <br/><br/>A Penny For My Thoughts is a game about recovering lost memories. Wh's memory is being recovered changes hands. So most players are doing second person past tense, with the person who's memory it is doing first person past tense.  It helps this with some ritual phrases, like you begin with "I remember..." so sticking to one POV is more natural.<br/><br/>But when I choose, it's based on how I feel.  I'd really like to explore POV in games more and instead shift it based on what I want the other players to feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fine" title="Fine"><img alt="Fine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fine">Fine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159135/#Comment_159135" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T12:02:04+00:00" title="July 28, 2008 12:02PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2008 12:05PM by Fine.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the warm welcomes, and thank you for the play experience so far!

I'd often be like, "We should make Nathan go stand under that tree and when the kobolds come by, he can hit them with his mace," despite the fact that Nathan is not actually near a tree and definitely doesn't have a mace. Nobody seemed to mind, partially because we were playing in a very "story light" style where we were mostly enjoying moving figures around and bashing things.  So, yeah, the switching is often very fluid, and often varies dramatically between different games, different groups, different players, and different play styles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159236/#Comment_159236" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T19:25:07+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  7:25PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, the more I *want* to share the experience, the more I speak in first person.<br/><br/>Me and a few really cool cats played a game called Mythender at a recent convention. It's a game about mythically powerful warriors, blessed by the Christian god, who travel to Mythic Norden to slay the last of the magical beasts. It's basically a game about taking down gods and dragons and the boogeymen that we've threatened children with all these years.<br/><br/>And I made this character was a violinist that'd defeated the metatron in a violin duel, and who had spurned god, and then eventually developed wanderlust and changed his mind on the whole nihilistic-prick thing. And while I was setting up this backstory and making my character and narrating his entry into the action... it was all very much third person. After all, I'm not a violinist, I'm not a mythic warrior, I'm not Christian, I'm not ever going to beat an angel at anything.<br/><br/>So, we're in this fight against a gigantic dragon and the mud and earth around it, which <i>became animated and attempted to swallow us whole</i>. And still I'm in third person. The action is awesome, I'm loving it, but it's not something that feels in any way connected to me. And then the earth splashes over me, knocking me down. It hardens into a casket, with me trapped inside. Claustrophobic and dying. And I've obviously never been trapped inside of an earthen casket that's trying to kill me before, but imagining that feeling of being trapped under that weight, with no stability or way to escape (after all, it's THE EARTH).... suddenly everything was in first person. I died. God shone his light down on my casket. My inanimate body burst through the clay and hovered in the sky. I coughed up clay and mud, as I sputtered back to life.<br/><br/>Before, this guy had been there to kill a dragon. But suddenly, I was there, ready to fight back against the very earth that I walked upon. Ready to take what had recently been a fantastical and slightly ridiculous story, and make it personal.<br/><br/>And I'm sure I didn't make a conscious decision about tense or pronoun usage in that case.

"I use my Twin Strike."<br/><br/>Sometimes we use third person ("Balthazar is going to use his Second Wind"), but it's less often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159271/#Comment_159271" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T00:21:30+00:00" title="July 29, 2008 12:21AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, as in writting, most of the times dialogues easily come in first person.<br/><br/>Even if your narration is mostly in third person, it also can kind of break the mood to say "Mr. Paladin says to the King he'll honor his word.", instead of something like "Aye, my Lord.

The activity of playing an RPG is really completely unlike story-telling, so the language doesn't enter into consideration so much. A transcript of a game session generally looks and sounds very... odd and unnatural. Certainly not something you would want to read. So the style of narration and so on is rarely a big concern.<br/><br/>However, some games do lead more to "storytelling" or "narration" style. For instance, Polaris (even though definitely a roleplaying game) has the players use ritual phrases (which are past tense and third person) on a regular basis, and in my experience that makes everyone begin narrating in past tense and third person. In contrast, I've played a number of storytelling games (unlike RPGs, no one portrays a particular character), and while no one ever narrated in first person, it was impossible to remain in past tense. I don't know if it was just because the story was being made up as we went along, or some other reason, but on many occasions, with different players, no matter how hard we tried, the narration would switch into present tense. People just couldn't handle staying in past tense. I find this interesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159398/#Comment_159398" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T10:17:59+00:00" title="July 29, 2008 10:17AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>So, I noticed that, when playing D&amp;D4 last week, I switched between referring to the other players' characters by the names of the characters in the fiction and the names of the players, because I couldn't remember what the characters' names were (it's just the second session of this game).</blockquote>\nOoh, that's interesting. In our D&amp;D game, the GM has been explicitly referring to us by character name, even when asking something Meta. Sometimes it's direct, "Okay Jak, what are you doing," and sometimes indirect, "What is Jak doing?"  I'm not sure if it has a profound story effect (I think we've been story light so far), but it does help me remember everyone's PC's name. I'll have to remember to ask him what his intention is.

Most of the time I couldn't make it feel right and stuck with third person.

Then I describe his actions. Hell, I don't play LARPS and sometimes I even "act" my actions (such as putting a book aside, aiming my arrows at someone or stuff like that).
