Just today I decided to can the idea. \xa0I think that, that decision deserves some examining.\xa0<br/><br/>The idea itself isn't really important to this discussion but what work I had done on it is. What I had at the time of the project's demise was; a rather long note on my iPhone, two pages of short hand rules, and three sheets of graphs, heiroglyphs and numbers which where beguining to hurt my brain. All together this represented maybe three hours of real thought and effort and about an hour total (over the course of a few days) of just throwing ideas into my phone.<br/><br/>When I knew that the project needed serious evaluation was when I got to page three of charting out rule interactions. \xa0I looked at where I was and then looked ahead. In my estimation I had far more to do than I had already done just to bring the design to a point where it could turn from doodles and charts into a working prototype. I also guessed that when I was done the prototype would be horribly broken (I know I forgot to carry the one somewhere I just didn't know where). Looking at the work nessessary to bring a broken prototype to reality along with concidering the likelyhood that I would ever make the changes nessessary to make the design work (not likely among my other projects) I decided to can the project.\xa0<br/><br/>If I had looked ahead and seen a shorter work cycle, a quicker path from prototype to finished design, or a higher probability that the project would keep my interest I would likely have kept working. Canning a project before prototype stage is something new to me and I was suprised by how good it felt. Before, abandoning a design I had put so much work into (getting it to prototype by hook or by crook) hurt a little. I always felt that canning a project that far along was a betrail of all the work I had put in. This time, however, I felt reassured that the design's time was up and felt good that I had saved myself the time and effort I might have wasted.\xa0<br/><br/>Do I still feel like there may be useful nuggets hidden within that design? \xa0Sure I do, thats why the two page rules sketch went back into my folder of horrible ideas. The rest of the work, the actuary chart from hell and the gibbering notes on a madman's phone, got tossed as I felt they held nothing of value to future projects.\xa0<br/><br/>Learning to let go is valuable but I fear it may be dangerous as well. I do not regret scrapping this game at this point but I need to add that into my conciderations in the future. \xa0Will I regret letting this go? \xa0I hope I can contenue makeing wise decisions about my designs on into future projects.\xa0                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308763/#Comment_308763" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T11:23:16+00:00" title="January 19, 2011 11:23AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made a New Year's resolution this year to only work on new projects, letting go all the old stuff that I've been hammering away at (like in Metallica's classic video for "The Unforgiven"), and only dredging up older stuff if I was willing to completely rethink it and rebuild it anew.<br/><br/>Another thing I've added to that is: only work on games that I'm excited about playing.

Like, you start working on game A before game B, but -- really -- you need to finish B before you can finish A, because there are a few problems you need to solve and B is a better place to solve them than A.<br/><br/>A good example is how working on Super Suit is solving many of the problems that I had with both Geiger Counter and An Ill-Fated Descent.  But I'm already too invested in Geiger Counter to be willing to be experimental and gut that project entirely before rewriting it, plus the people who already liked Geiger Counter would freak out if I released versions that got substantially worse before they got better.  Consequently, I need to work on my problems with Geiger Counter in another game -- a game that I have much less history and investment in -- and then come back later.<br/><br/>John Harper said that he was feeling similarly about Danger Patrol and -- while those are both unfinished games that have seen a lot of play in their alpha and beta drafts -- I think that can hold true for other games as well. Forking certain concepts off into a "side game" is not really about managing audience expectations so much as it is clearing away everything else and giving yourself space and permission to really go to work on a design problem, digging into the guts and trying a few new ideas without any expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308815/#Comment_308815" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T20:01:11+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  8:01PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My ex-wife had the potential to be a good artist.

I tried recently to pick an old project up and see if I might make it work. Still not clicking. Some other time maybe, but no, to abandon something is too radical a choice for my way of thinking. The most extreme solution I can think of is cannibalizing the (possibly) working bits for another new project, but that doesn't mean the elimination of the original idea. You can still cannibalize crunch bits from a game that doesn't work, finish another work with those, then get back to the previous work and, thanks to the new experience, find the solution.
