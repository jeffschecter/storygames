Today I had a little free time and took some 3x5 note cards to come up with a few random Noir characters.  But when I got to the "Goal" part of each character I was drawing a blank.  What was it that they were all looking for?  So I threw together a R-Map and created an overarching plot; "Stop a crazed killer who is loose on the streets of LA".  I figured that every character would either connect directly to the plot or connect to a character who connected to the plot.<br/><br/>And after re-reading the cool <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2323&amp;page=1#Item_23" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> here recently, I decided to start creating links between the characters on the map to see what came of it.  And damned if that wasn't the funnest part!  I've linked to a quick throw-together <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/235/447842476_e6ef48ae52_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">R-map</a> to show the relationships.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, things happen in the following order:<br/>1. Group decides on a setting and a time (i.e. 1946 L.A.)<br/>2. Group decides on an overarching plot (i.e. "Stop a crazed killer who is loose on the streets of L.A.")<br/>3. One person adds a name to the R-Map.  And below it they add the character's "profession" with an adjective (i.e. Gritty Prizefighter).<br/>4. This continues around the table until there are at least twice as many characters as there are players in the game.<br/>5. Then the next player draws an arrow from one character to another and defines a relationship of some sort.<br/>6. This continues until the players are satisfied or the GM thinks there is enough material to continue.<br/>7. Finally each player gets to choose a character from the R-Map to flesh out.  This is important because everyone first contributes to the R-Map (characters and relationships) as a group and then they get to cherry-pick the character they really want to play.<br/><br/>And now I'm looking at the "finished " R-Map and seeing that only two relationships really reference the plot at all and I'm wondering if that's a bad thing.  So my questions are:<br/><br/><b>1. Does it make sense to keep the plot/McGuffin there just to add glue to the characters and their relationships?  My guess here is yes.<br/>2. Do the existing relationships look like enough to start having scenes and developing conflicts?  I think so, but wish there was more pushing them.<br/>3. Should the character goals be linked more to the plot somehow, to their relationships, or to some other inner goal?  I've always been tending towards the latter.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63077/#Comment_63077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T19:56:13+00:00" title="April  5, 2007  7:56PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. I agree that it makes sense to keep the plot hook "a crazed killer is on the loose" but as pure situation into which this relationship map is dropped. Some characters don't care if the killer gets caught; others might root for him. In any event, they're working out their own issues.<br/><br/>2. You've totally got enough here, IF you imagine that the GM has the authority to push by invoking the plot hook: the reporter's editor tells him to find out why the crazy industrialist is acting crazier than usual, the killer is wounded and winds up with the nurse tending to him as his hostage (that's very noir), and so forth. GM gotta push.<br/><br/>3. Tony L-B has spent a long time thinking about this sort of thing; hunt up the Misery Bubblegum threads and draw your own conclusion. Inner is probably okay, depending on what you mean, but it looks like each character on your map can be pretty adequately defined in terms of what they want from each other character they're connected to. But if you say there's a larger "identity issue" at stake for each character -- whether they get to define themselves how they want, or have to accept someone else's definition of them -- I'll buy that.  Maybe for your map:<br/><br/>The crazed industrialist's issue is to prove that he's rich and powerful.<br/>The paranoid gunman's issue is to show that he's tough and doesn't need anybody.<br/>The gritty prizefighter's issue is that he's afraid he's a loser.<br/>The bubbly cigarette girl's issue is that no one should think she's a whore.<br/>The harried nurse's issue is that she'll never have anything but her work ever again.<br/>The reporter's issue is that he has to know all the angles.<br/>The pawnbroker's issue is that he's a legitimate businessman, no matter what anyone says.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how you mechanically represent those, but I know you've got a line on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63082/#Comment_63082" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T21:46:58+00:00" title="April  5, 2007  9:46PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You've totally got enough here, IF you imagine that the GM has the authority to push by invoking the plot hook</blockquote>\nThank you for reminding me about this.  I've been playing enough hippy GM-less games lately that I sometimes forget about the power of aggressive GM scene-framing.<br/><br/>I also like your concept of "identity stake"...I think that's more what I had in mind for "Goals" on the character sheet.  Looking at a Film Noir like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042208/" rel="nofollow">The Asphalt Jungle</a>, all of the main characters are tied in some way to the heist.  But in reality, Dix just wants to get back to his family's farm, Doc wants to retire to South America with enough money for some young female admirers, and Emmerich wants to protect his front as a "legitimate" lawyer.  Even Emmerich's mistress just wants to fly to Cuba because it sounds nice.  And when the heist goes bad, they all keep grasping with increased desperation at those early goals.  It's not about the money...it's about what the money allows them to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
