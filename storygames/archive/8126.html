I ran the Beast Hunters demo and played in Barbarians of Lemuria and the Roach.  The Roach is some kinda fun; we drugged each other, indulged our <i>appetites</i>, vandalized some ceremonial mustaches, electrocuted some freshmen, and cashed checks for anti-unionist mind control technologies.  You know how it goes.<br/><br/>After hours, we rocked some double boner biscuits with a sweet 1001 Nights game at Ogre's place.  Long live Chudo Udo and his gullet-full of legendary Russians!<br/><br/>Thanks to Sophie, Ed, Laura, Mark, John, and all the other ECGF folks for a bitchin minicon, and also to storygame cruise directors Ogre and Mickey.  And whoever donated the Riddle of Steel core book to the raffle -- I promise I'm gonna make it a good home.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eryops" title="Eryops"><img alt="Eryops" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i732.photobucket.com/albums/ww325/Tibor_02/ceilingcat22.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eryops">Eryops</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178910/#Comment_178910" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T12:47:45+00:00" title="November 16, 2008 12:47PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a great time as well.

I had been interested in checking out the fully developed version (I had the old free PDF) and it did not disappoint.  Johnzo, Ogre and I cooked up nice little "dysfunctional Barbarian family" vibe and Kristian rode along.  Thanks to some quick prep by Alan as the gamemaster and we had a nice little stewpot of greed, double dealing and stabbing.  BoL features very simple 10 minutes or less character creation (pick from some lists, then spread a few number around) that nevertheless leaves you with a character that has some nice color and hooks built in, and is embedded into the setting.  The system is simple no fuss task resolution, which can be drifted to CR with just a little bit of story gamer fu.  Highly recommended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179019/#Comment_179019" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T13:58:49+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  1:58PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heck, yes!<br/>some old school (like, ancient) shotgun wedding attemptery in IAWA,<br/>some post-modern Zombie Cinema below the streets of paris (oh, Bob's death scene was just too poetic.)<br/>and the bonus game-track of 1,001 nights back at ogre's seriously ranks with my best remembered experiences.<br/>God, ogre's chudo-udo description was just so stellar. goosebumps. and the yogurt cooled in wells was most delicious.<br/>went so nicely with the pretzels.<br/><br/>AND!<br/>if anyone managed to end up with one of those copies of Kobold Quarterly, purposefully or accidently-<br/>flip open to the last two page spread, there's the gold!<br/>i'll admit that i just took the copy because i didn't want to go to the trouble of refusing it and wanted to get back to Chombie Zinema,<br/>but this morning found me merrily rolling percentile and lol-ing to myself.<br/><br/>there's this chart which lets you figure a name for an old-school adventure module.<br/>so funny.<br/><br/>i made:<br/>1.
