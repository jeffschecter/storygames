Magic as a currency which can debase as more of it is injected into the world (via discovery, epiphanies, training and meditation, etc).<br/><br/>Could be sort of fun, for a while. I can see it fitting a game with a proscribed Narrative Arc and clear End Condition (no more manna) like Grey Ranks. Play would be more about how you leverage its utility while it has some, to establish yourself (or take everyone down with you!). Some mage's would have "Golden Parachutes" setup (enchantments?) while others would squander their power trying to find that "mother load" cache of remaining magic, up in them thar hills (or Antarctica or what-not). Still others might "buy-back" waning power from other mages, like short sellers.<br/><br/>And what would the NON-mages be doing, as they watch the Gods on Earth begin to become just the feeble old folks that they are? There could be some interesting nuances of theme revolving around revolution or "meek inherit the Earth" and such-like.<br/>-----<br/>BTW, Niven's done a few novels about magic going away (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven#Magic_Goes_Away" rel="nofollow">Magic Goes Away</a>--go figure!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170950/#Comment_170950" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:29:04+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The fate of the Zaru in TSOY's Near is all about having lost the defining assets, partially in the hands of the enemy now.

You see, magic can be used to turn lead into a luminous crystal form. Expose the crystal to a magical field, and the raw energy is released. Suddenly magic can be used as a form of exchange. There's still money, but the big magical powers use crystals as their currency.<br/><br/>An individual mage can only produce so much magic at once, because the power comes out of their own life force. If they need more, they can borrow crystals on security, essentially siphoning off a small portion of their life force over time to cover the loan. In the meantime, they can do bigger enchantments than they could otherwise.<br/><br/>Enchanter's guilds can do the conversion for a small percentage of the exchange. Investors can offer a portion of their magical life force against a future payoff with interest. The enchanters take this life force and use it to create crystals to lend.<br/><br/>So here's what happens when the system melts down:<br/><br/>The investors want their investment back now. They go to the enchanters. But the enchanters don't have enough magic to pay off the investors right now. Most of their investment is currently lent out ot magicians. If the enchanters can't meet the investment they have to pay up with their own life force. Their life is literally on the line. Maybe there's a magical contract (in the form of an artifact of some sort) that allows this to be enforced in grisly detail.<br/><br/>So the enchanters are on the hook. They go to the magicians who owe them magic and demand it back RIGHT NOW, possibly by force. In this world, being foreclosed on means that the repossesors climb in your window at night and suck your life force out through your mouth, leaving you a withered husk.<br/><br/>And that's jus tthe legal lenders. The cimirnal underworld you don't want to think about. Their leg-breakers are the dessicated shades of past defaulters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170966/#Comment_170966" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:50:14+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:50AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tony, nice setting/ parable<br/><br/>captures how finance- money, credit, interest, etc - can 'magically' create something from nothing - but, when leveraged to highly or when the market is too effervescent, watch out for the down side..<br/><br/>by the way the undead collection agency reminds me of dead labor/dead capital in early marx                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170972/#Comment_170972" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:56:53+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 11:57AM by Marshall Burns.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason Corley is right, money is a kind of magic.  <br/><br/>From a magical worldview, everything is power manifested as symbol -- a vehicle and an intent.  "A knife" isn't "a knife"; it's a symbol representing the concept of KNIFE.  The virtue of a knife is that it cuts.  But the intent is independent of the vehicle -- a shard of glass can cut, as can a beam of light, a hand, a word, a thought.<br/><br/>The virtue of money is that it is exchanged for other things.  In effect, it changes its shape.<br/><br/>And, of course, the virtue can go out of a symbol.  A knife goes dull, a car runs out of gas, a wand shatters, a wad of cash is reduced to spare change.<br/><br/>(And, yes, I'm already working on a game centered around this line of magical thought)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170979/#Comment_170979" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T12:25:25+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 12:25PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            marshall, cool- l look forward to it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171020/#Comment_171020" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T13:48:52+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  1:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!  That's always good to hear.  The working title is <i>Uncanny Underground</i>.  Your character's abilities are defined in a series of Virtues (from a set list in the manner of <i>Sorcerer</i> that can be expanded if all the players agree), invested in various player-specified forms:  innate ability, objects you are carrying, bonds and contracts you have established with other entities, etc.  These Virtues have a number that indicates how much power they have.  Each time you use it, the power drops by the amount you used, and you have to replenish it ; if it goes below zero, the Virtue is broken, gone forever.  Power can be bought, traded, stolen, lost, inherited, given, or, if you've got the means, transformed.<br/><br/>(One of the Virtues I'm really fond of is called Access.  You define what exactly it gives you Access to, and you can use it any time you need that thing.  So, you've got Access to Cars?  Then as you're running out of the building, chased by enemies, and you need a quick getaway, there's a car right outside, ready for you to drive it away.  This could be innate, like there's just a car around whenever you need one <i>for no apparent reason</i>, or it could be invested in, say, a cellphone that you dial and say "I need a ride," or it could be invested in a demon you've contracted to be your wheelman, whatever)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
