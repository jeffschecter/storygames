                    This thread is a follow up from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=310" rel="nofollow">Sell me on Task Resolution</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=347" rel="nofollow">Maneuvers, Stakes, and Player Knowledge</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In the second thread, John Kim asked about the terms Stakes Resolution and Maneuver Resolution, as I was using them in the first thread. He had an interesting follow-up regarding player knowledge and some other stuff, which I'll get to shortly.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this thread is to define my terms (possibly for this thread only, unless others want to adopt them for general use) so that we can focus on discussing the ideas behind them, rather than debating the definitions themselves. I don't enjoy a lot of definition debate, but I know other people do. So I forked off this side-thread as a place where I could put a stake in the ground and ask everyone to only focus on how the ideas intersect with our game play.<br/>
<br/>
<b>I'm going to post three more messages, then everyone else is free to jump in.</b> The next message will define Stakes Resolution. The one after that will define Maneuver Resolution (a term I stole from Joshua). And the third message will address questions brought up by John Kim in the player knowledge thread above.<br/>
<br/>
For this thread, it is completely off-topic to discuss different definitions for these terms or to suggest different terms for the ideas.                </div>

<b>Stakes Resolution</b><br/>
<br/>
In its simplest form, Stakes Resolution has three steps:<br/>
<br/>
1. The players involved agree to the stakes. This agreement may or may not be spoken. This agreement <i>must</i> come before the mechanic is engaged.<br/>
<br/>
"If you lose, your brother goes into town and shoots the woman."<br/>
"If you win, your brother does not go into town and shoot the woman."<br/>
<br/>
2. The mechanic is engaged (add skill points, roll dice, draw cards, use drama, etc.) which results in one outcome being selected over another.<br/>
<br/>
"I won! He doesn't shoot her."<br/>
<br/>
3. The final outcome becomes part of the fiction. It "happens" in the world of the game. All the players abide by the outcome, as stipulated in the stakes.<br/>
<br/>
"Your brother looks at you as tears well up in his eyes. 'I don't know how it came to this' he says. He puts the gun away."<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
More examples of Stakes Resolution:<br/>
<br/>
"If you win the fight (by reducing the monster's hit points to -10), it dies."<br/>
"If you lose the fight (by having your hit points reduced to -10), you die."<br/>
<br/>
"If you succeed at 10 climbing rolls, you will have climbed the cliff."<br/>
"If you fail a climbing roll, you fall back to the bottom and take damage."<br/>
<br/>
"If you make your Investigate roll, I will tell you something that will help your character."<br/>
"If you fail your Investigate roll, I won't tell you anything."<br/>
"If you fail your Investigate roll by 10, something very bad will happen to your character."<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
The key to SR is that the players agree to stakes <b>before</b> the rolling happens. They essentially enter into a contract that says they will abide by the outcome of the dice, as established by the stakes. Nothing else may modify the stakes once the final outcome has been determined -- UNLESS the players agree to a new contract and begin the process again.                        </div>

<b>Maneuver Resolution</b><br/>
<br/>
With Maneuver Resolution, the players do not enter into a contract before the mechanic is engaged. Instead, the mechanic determines whether an attempted maneuver "happens" or not. The outcome and effect of the maneuver is determined by another process in the system, and may be modified or even negated after the roll.<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
Examples of Maneuver Resolution:<br/>
<br/>
"I split your ugly face with this axe-handle! Raise with 12."<br/>
"Oh no you don't. I duck under your swing and it misses me by a mile. Dodge with 12."<br/>
<br/>
"I put my sword through the goblin's neck! I hit for... gah... 3 points of damage."<br/>
"Your blade bounces off its shield and just nicks the goblin's skin, leaving a trickle of green blood behind."<br/>
<br/>
"I want to climb the cliff."<br/>
"It looks pretty tricky. DC 25."<br/>
"Okay. I'll take extra time for +2. Climbing roll of... 20."<br/>
"Ah, close. Just when you get to the top, your hand slips. You skitter backwards and clutch a root to stop your fall to certain death. You hang there in midair, legs kicking."<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
So, obviously, Maneuver Resolution is sometimes embedded in Stakes Resolution. Sometimes it isn't. Unlike Stakes Resolution, players are not required to agree to anything before the mechanic is engaged, and the final outcome can be modified or substituted with a different outcome, as determined by another player or system.                        </div>

As you can see, SR is concerned with <b>outcomes</b> (of any scale). The "moves" performed to get to the outcome may be strongly or loosely connected to the outcome, depending on the mechanic.<br/>

MR is concerned with <b>"moves"</b> performed in the world of the game. The final outcome or effect may be strongly or loosely connected to the moves, depending on the mechanic.<br/>

<br>
Does this mean that Dogs In The Vineyard has a combination of stakes resolution and manoeuvre resolution? The resolution of the stakes is stakes resolution (and note that things are introduced into the fiction before the stakes are decided - which still fits John's definition). But fallout is manoeuvre resolution?<br>
<br>
Sorry about the spelling of  "manoeuvre". I have to.<br>

It would still help me if you could comment on the specific example to demonstrate this more  concretely.  Player knowledge is necessary for agreement to stakes, right?  If the player doesn't know that the monster has damage reduction, then the player hasn't really agreed to the outcome of the roll.  That is, he thought that the usual result would apply: i.e. damage he rolled would be subtracted from the creature's hit points.  Conversely, another player who does know about the DR ability is implicitly agreeing to the outcome of the roll when she makes her attack.  <br><br>Also, you give as an example of stakes resolution this:
<blockquote>"If you make your Investigate roll, I will tell you something that will help your character."<br>"If you fail your Investigate roll, I won't tell you anything."<br>"If you fail your Investigate roll by 10, something very bad will happen to your character."</br></br></blockquote>
This seems questionable to me.  That is, if the outcomes are sufficiently vague, then I think that Stakes Resolution must shade into Maneuver Resolution,  right?  For example, consider: <br><br>If you roll a critical success, something very good happens to your character. <br>If you roll a success, something good happens to your character. <br>If you roll a failure, something bad happens to your character. <br>If you roll a critical failure, something very bad happens to your character.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            It seems to me that part of the "stakes contract" is also agreeing to the rules of the game. So, pretty much every attack roll in D&amp;D has an agreement along the lines of "If I hit the monster, I will deal my weapons damage, with any modifiers that that monster may have due to it's writeup, which I may have to determine for myself from the GMs description of my strike."                        </div>

                            Well, John Harper's example of Maneuver Resolution includes:
<blockquote>"I split your ugly face with this axe-handle! Raise with 12."<br>"Oh no you don't. I duck under your swing and it misses me by a mile. Dodge with 12."</br></blockquote>
So I think this means that most of Polaris resolution is Maneuver Resolution.  Actually, I'm not sure where it fits.  Unlike Dogs, in Polaris there's no negotiation of stakes prior to the start of conflict.  Any statement you make can by the rules be overturned.  <br><br>Also, I think Soap was considered Conflict Resolution in many places, but it also seems to fit better with John Harper's example of Maneuver Resolution here.                        </br></br></div>

However you may then be making lots of rolls to catch the edge of the thing you were jumping to, to catch a flagpoll on the way down, to have someone on the other side catch you, etc. The action occurs maneuver by manuever, and even when you fail (or succede) at one part you never know exactly when the conflict will be over. <br><br>In Spycraft 2.0, otoh, the rules for jumping are laid out in the book with painfull clearness. If you make your jump roll you make it. If you critical it you make it with X room to spare. If you fail you do not jump -- you stop at the edge, realize you can't make the jump, and have to stop. If you fumble you jump, don't make it, fall and hit shit and probably splatter. When you make a jump roll you know what it counts for, and know exactly when and how the conflict is going to be ending. <br><br>So even though both are using the same size and scale of action, and even though both may be embeded in larger scenes or challanges, on is based on moment to moment development of play and the other is based on meeting or failing pre-established stakes. <br><br>Sound right?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<b>Brand:</b> Yes! That's a great example.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tony:</b> I agree. SR and MR as defined here map exactly to how I view CR and TR. But, given all the confusion in some other threads over the CR and TR terms, I thought it was worth it to start fresh and work from "new" terms. <i>But I really, really don't want to talk more about the whole terms issue here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>John Kim:</b> I'm glad you brought up the vague SR example. That was very much on purpose. Having perfectly clear and precise stakes are not a requirement of Stakes Resolution. What's required is that the players involved agree to the stakes as established -- <i>before the roll</i>.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, this is Stakes Resolution:<br/>
<br/>
"If you roll a critical success, something very good happens to your character.<br/>
If you roll a success, something good happens to your character.<br/>
If you roll a failure, something bad happens to your character.<br/>
If you roll a critical failure, something very bad happens to your character."<br/>
<br/>
But ONLY if the players agree to it before the dice hit the table.<br/>
<br/>
I think I see what you're getting at about player knowledge now. And I agree that it is kind of a gray area. I think Nathan's answer is interesting, but it's reaching up to social contract as opposed to a specific resolution method.<br/>
<br/>
Let me put it another way, and see if this helps: I think almost every single roll in a game of D&amp;D is Maneuver Resolution, even including combat rolls. I mean, yes, the D&amp;D combat system is a kind of stakes resolution -- specfically winning or losing a fight (-10 HP) = death. However, players don't usually know how many hit points a monster has, or what its capabilities are, and even if they do know, the DM has the ability to modify them before combat. AND the DM can add anything he wants to the conflict after it has started, including more monsters, an invisible healing ray for the monsters, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Given "open" combats like that, D&amp;D can't deliver true Stakes Resolution. The players think they're agreeing to the terms of the stakes when they go in, but those terms can be manipulated during resolution without their knowledge or consent. So no SR is happening.<br/>

                            In Maneuver Resolution, can you narrate your own failure? Theoretically, it's possible, but is it possible in practice?<br>
<br>
"I want to climb the cliff."<br>
"It looks pretty tricky. DC 25."<br>
"Okay. I'll take extra time for +2. Climbing roll of... 20."<br>
"Crap! Okay, just when I get to the top, the rock I'm holding collapses and I tumble backwards, but my lightning fast reflexes save me and I grab a root about ten feet down, my feet dangling beneath me. Whew!"<br>
<br>
The trick is that since stakes were not negotiated pre-roll, they have to be negotiated now. Presumably, the GM is the "neutral arbiter" of consequence, but we all know it doesn't always work that way. If you let the player narrate his own consequences, someone (the GM, other players, whatever) has to "judge" that the player's narration doesn't essentially let him win the stakes that were never pre-negotiated.<br>

"Dude, no fair. You failed that roll. You can't climb to the top on a failure."<br>
"Why not? I still fell and made a fool of myself in front of the princess."<br>
"Yeah, but who cares? The roll was about climbing, not about impressing the chick."<br>

This doesn't feel right to me as a distinction.  If I'm facing a bunch of orcs in D&amp;D, I feel fairly sure of what I can do as a player -- i.e. what my options and chances are, and the expected results.  While I could be surprised, it's not the usual.  If I'm facing a sinner in Dogs, the possibilities feel more up in the air to me.  The proto-NPC rules set limits on what dice the GM can pull, but there's a wide range (from no d10s to 5d10 or more, for example).  And I can't be sure which traits I can pull in.  <br><br>While Dogs doesn't allow new characters to join in the middle of a conflict, there are parallel effects.  The GM is free to invent background and has at least some leeway in dice by assigning traits.  Also, she can freely add new opponents between conflicts.  Is there really such a huge difference between sending in a new opponent in the middle of a fight -- and sending in another new opponent afterwards?  <br><br>I coming to believe there are too many issues here to adequately be distinguished in a binary X vs Y distinction.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

When you face the orcs in D&amp;D, you may or may not enter into Stakes Resolution. It's not the possibilities or surprises that are significant. It's <i>agreement to the stakes before the roll</i> that matters. That's all. Are you able to agree to the stakes, then roll and abide by the outcome? That's SR. Everything else is just noise.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs is the most clear cut case possible. All conflicts are very explicit Stakes Resolution, with Maneuver Resolution embedded for each Raise and See.<br/>
<br/>
Where's the confusion? I guess I'm still not seeing it.                        </div>

You're right. Maneuver Resolution doesn't address that issue. Narration is outside the scope of the definitions. Interesting thoughts, though.                        </div>

                            You're facing down orcs.  The stakes are, obviously, do you rout the orcs or do they force you to retreat?  How many times do you have to roll dice in order to rout them?  Do they give up when they're down to half their number?  Do they fight to the death?  Do they fee when they see your bright, shiny swords?<br>
<br>
Whether or not there are stakes is not the same as each and every roll having a direct and transparent effect on which stakes come to pass.                        </br></br></div>

                            That's probably a very good question, ross.<br>
<br>
I generally define stakes as 'explicitly created and negotiated by the play group'.  John also considers pre-defined and discrete effects of rolls to be 'stakes' because everyone understands what they are going into the roll.<br>
<br>
Stakes have a pretty broad potential range that is usually limited by the play group (no meaningless death, etc).<br>
<br>
Who gets to set the stakes and how they do so are both important considerations.<br>
<br>
John, since this is your show, you want to give us your definition that you're working with?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            let me be frank. We are writing manuals for games. This is technical writing, and in technical writing we don't get to use a term that is not defined.                        </div>

                            Stakes are a set of possible outcomes. They may be vague or specific, and I don't specify their source (i.e. how they are created) for the purposes of these definitions.<br/>
<br/>
They generally fit the formulation, "What's at stake is, does your brother go kill the woman in town?" Or "If you win, X. If you lose, Y." X and Y are stakes.                        </div>

                            Actually, we're discussing theory about playing games, which may become theory about writing games. We are not, at this moment, actually writing any game at all. <br><br>By the time we get around to doing that, we do have to have our ducks in a row. This is true. But we're not up the mountain yet.                        </br></br></div>

                            I was under the impression we were game designers framing our discussions in terms of creation and clarity. I don't mind it when definitions change, but having no real definition makes an idea too ephemeral.                        </div>
