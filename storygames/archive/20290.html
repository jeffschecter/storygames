I've been working on this for over a year now and it's become a<i> totally</i> different creature from the pseudo-D&amp;D that i started off with.<br/><br/>Now, it's simply a game about making stories together, without any human characters. Aimed mostly at (aspiring) writers and actors, but meant for everyone who loves a good tale. You start by pulling 1 card from the following decks: Clade (your species), Stature (your position in life/job) and Numen (your magical gift). This allows you to write a character out of your comfort zone, be it protagonist/antagonist/sidekick/... . Plus NPC's can also easily be build up from this template. Your history, gender, etc. are all chosen by you, but a sort of "<i>native american name</i>" will be given to you by the other players, based on your appearance, deeds or family. So this "moniker" can change throughout the story. <br/><br/>From there on out, it follows the "8 sequences" that make up most stories, whatever the genre may be. During each sequence, you each pull a card from the Ambition deck. This is your personal motivation during that sequence. This can span throughout the entire story or can simply be resolved in a couple of turns. As a group, you also pull one Objective card. This is the main "goal" during that sequence. A binding element that drives the story forward, if you will. Many of them can be interpreted in their own way, so you can give it your own twist.<br/><br/>I've left out a lot of details but so far, so good, right? Well, not really, i'm afraid that it lacks an element that drives the story forward. And well, i have no idea how to solve this. Maracanda, a friend of mine, has recommended me to avoid using a win/fail mechanic. I've also considered using a sort of democratic system to vote on ideas, but frankly, that's just a disaster waiting to happen. And trying to turn <i>the Maslow Pyramid</i> into a game mechanic hasn't seemed to work either. <br/><br/>So i'm turning this over to the experts. Any advice that can be given is more than welcome! And if you want to know more about <b>"The Warring Woods"</b>, be sure to let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447279/#Comment_447279" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-27T18:47:00+00:00" title="July 27, 2015  6:47PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The design and presentation look awesome! <br/><br/>Do you have anything more to show us? Pages, rules summaries... I'm especially looking forward to seeing more of the layout. <br/><br/>In my opinion, win/fail mechanics don't pull the story onwards. On the opposite, 'failing' on something (or even 'winning' in a way) removes you from your creative role and ransoms the story. The challenge is to create procedures that create and reinforce the kind of story you want to be played. I think your decks work quite well to inspire the story and pull it forward. <br/><br/>A mechanic for fairness is something else. This is usually what win/fail mechanics and gamemasters function as. I don't believe in heavy-handed systems much. In <i>Microscope</i> or <i>The Extraordinary adventures of Baron Munchausen</i>, for instance, narration mandate is hardly diluted, except for a very conditional veto. In a bunch of games, players need to work together to overcome a challenge, so there is less need for inter-player fairness. <br/><br/>Psychological research points out that when players sit down at a table, there are already social expectations and roles between them, or they are quickly improvised and exerted. This unspoken 'social contract' is what your rules are up against. You can only challenge this insofar as the players want to roll with it. That's why only minimalist interferences can puncture this network of social performances. In <i>Monsterhearts </i>gender performance is pierced by tiny sub-rules and tone (for instance pc's can be turned on regardless from orientation and gender). In <i>Alien\xf2r</i> the powers of the narrator are centrifugally balanced by the performer of Alien\xf2rs character. I don't believe the performance of social roles out of the game is natural or beneficial. Imo, games should teach us to challenge them (and learn better ones). <br/><br/>I also think you'd have had more luck with your thread of you had a different title... But... show us more please!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBalcaen" title="DBalcaen"><img alt="DBalcaen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBalcaen">DBalcaen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447285/#Comment_447285" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-27T21:00:55+00:00" title="July 27, 2015  9:00PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2015 9:01PM by DBalcaen.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the response, Maracanda!<br/>Everything that's done can be found here:<br/><br/><b>Character creation</b><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfNHBlWGJYcm8yS2c" rel="nofollow">Character sheet</a><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfV1hGWDZYRGFZUHM" rel="nofollow">Clade cards</a> - Your species<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfcE81WVEwaG9vT1E" rel="nofollow">Stature cards</a> - Your role in society<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfMDhHa2hWTmlqZjA" rel="nofollow">Numen cards</a> - Your magical gift<br/><br/><b>Gameplay </b><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfRU9qQjB1anhyUkk" rel="nofollow">Sequence list</a><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfWmUzTzdTZ1BDbk0" rel="nofollow">Ambition cards</a> - Your personal drive <br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfOFd5c1ozenNoc28" rel="nofollow">Objective cards</a> - The groups motivation<br/><br/><b>Manual</b><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHOiyLzfylfbE1RN0ZpcmxtZlE" rel="nofollow">Manual</a> - WIP | Only up to the point where the actual game starts since i'm still working out the kinks<br/><br/>Besides all this, i'm also going to make a sort of cheat sheet for the people who don't have access to the cards while playing, as these can easily be replaced by a deck of playing cards.<br/><br/>But back to the issue at hand, your advice might point me in the right direction. It does indeed seem like it's a fairness mechanic that i am looking for. So far, the only actual "rules" i have seem to be narrative restrictions in order to make the players think outside of the box (there are no humans/apes, there is no currency, magic relies on either creation/destruction, etc.). Does this seem like a step in the right direction? Or am i looking at it the wrong way? And could you elaborate on the "conditional veto" you mentioned? It's something i had in mind with a small amount of tokens as a limit, but still the idea of vetoing someones idea seems harsh.<br/><br/>And you're probably right about the title, i'll keep that in mind for my next posts.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447291/#Comment_447291" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T00:38:12+00:00" title="July 28, 2015 12:38AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does a typical game look like, and where does it go wrong?

In my games, the answers to this question has been things like this:<br/>* Look at the Friction Meter. If the characters are fighting, threaten them with something. If they are not fighting, find something that can get them to fight.<br/>* Look at the relationship map. Find two characters who have a conflict of interests and find a way to escalate that conflict.<br/>* Look at the list of questions. Set a scene to either answer one of the questions, or to ask a new one.<br/>It seems the answer you have is "Look at the Sequence list. Set a scene where the things that should happen in this sequence happen". That's pretty good, but maybe it's not enough? Mechanically going through the Storytelling 101 sequence doesn't guarantee a good story. Maybe you need to make the players explore the characters more, for example? Maybe we need to make sure that there's some uncertainty, so that it's not obvious from the beginning what the threat is and how the characters will eventually overcome it?<br/><br/>2: The Czege principle<br/>the Czege principle is basically "It's not fun to make up a problem and then solve it yourself". Maybe you need to make sure the players are giving each other creative challenges? "Here's a threat that looms over the characters, now you make up how they respond!". I've found it's very challenging to make a GMless game that has a group of characters facing a common threat. If there's no specific player playing the threat, the group will make up the threat and then make up how they face it, and that's not a lot of fun. For a game where characters are in conflict with each other, there's no need for a GM, but for a "party play" game, it's hard to go without. There are ways around it, though. One way is to make sure challenges are more individualized, facing one or two characters at a time. Another way is to have the players battle against the game itself, adding a layer of mechanical obstacles, but that's probably not what you're after here.<br/><br/>Just some loose thoughts from my side. The game looks beautiful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447308/#Comment_447308" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T13:07:14+00:00" title="July 28, 2015  1:07PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If each player characters has <i>his</i> Clade, <i>his</i> Stature, <i>his</i> Numen, <i>his</i> Ambitions, while the whole group has one Objective dangling in a vacuum and nothing else, the design clearly tends towards very limited interactions between independent personal stories.<br/><br/>To encourage involvement of other characters (and, indirectly, the creation of a single coherent story everybody contributes to), I would add to the character descriptions something the character can do or use for the benefit of other characters (it might be magic, skills, favors, habits, objects, anything that fits the setting) and make characters "succeed" in their story if they involve another character's traits in their machinations. <br/><br/>For example (I hope I don't misunderstand the setting too much) the Mouse might need either the Bear's attitude for physical intimidation or the Eagle's hunting skills to reclaim his wife who has been kidnapped by the Snake. Convince either animal to help, and she's back (unless the Snake gets help...). <br/>It would be a better story, and better roleplaying, than the Mouse attempting a stealth rescue mission on his own and getting a random outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBalcaen" title="DBalcaen"><img alt="DBalcaen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBalcaen">DBalcaen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447323/#Comment_447323" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T21:19:41+00:00" title="July 28, 2015  9:19PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2015 10:12PM by DBalcaen.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>What does a typical game look like, and where does it go wrong?

My previous playtest did provide some interesting insights though. The process of creating characters proved to be very easy (even for two non-RPG players) and by sharing the background during the naming process, a sort of status quo was quickly established by the group. So by the time everybody got named we knew what kind of story we were going to have and how we each filled in certain roles. <br/><br/>In this particular example we had an ancient yet strong tortoise who was a kindhearted diplomat, a corrupt bear councilor, a raccoon scolar looking for forbidden wisdoms and a crazy snake herbalist. From there we each pulled an ambition card and compared them. The tortoise had the disaster card, while the councilor pulled the miracle card. We quickly agreed that what might be bad for the good guy, might seem like an chance for the bad guy. So again this seemed to work in the games favour. It had turned into a Game of Thrones-esque situation with the Councilor and his protegee, the Scolar, having poisoned the King with a potion from the Herbalist. And then, after interpreting the objective card, the story begins with the Diplomat being called back to the courts after the murder. <br/><br/>But that's where it grinds to a halt. As <i>lorenzogatti</i> points out, from here on out it's just every individual player spitballing ideas. They each have their own subplots going on in the form of the ambition cards. These are supposed to help drive the <i>objective</i> in that chapter (a single turn) or sequence (a couple of turns that are bound to narrative rules) forward. But it needs something more binding. Something that pulls it all together.<br/><br/>But i think the following quotes from <i>Simon_Pettersson</i> and <i>lorenzogatti</i> might prove useful in solving that:\n<blockquote><br/>If there's no specific player playing the threat, the group will make up the threat and then make up how they face it, and that's not a lot of fun. For a game where characters are in conflict with each other, there's no need for a GM, but for a "party play" game, it's hard to go without. </blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote><br/>The Mouse might need either the Bear's attitude for physical intimidation or the Eagle's hunting skills to reclaim his wife who has been kidnapped by the Snake. Convince either animal to help, and she's back (unless the Snake gets help...). <br/></blockquote>\nFrom what i've noticed, the players quickly pick their own side. During the last session there were 3 antagonists and 1 protagonist. So there is already a source of friction ensured. But even within the group of antagonists there were separate loyalties (for example, the Scolar was loyal to the Councilor). And that's something that might improve both teamwork and/or the creation of challenges.<br/><br/>A possible solution thus might be to quietly pick an ally after you've heard everyone's story, the story wherein their (alleged) background and skills are revealed. Or you just pull a name randomly (preferably from a hat, of course!) You do not reveal this person but in need you can provide him/her with aid. However, you can just as easily be on the other side, only aiding in the effort to fool you later. So an antagonist might reveal to have been on the protagonists side all along or vica versa. Only you know what side you're really on.<br/><br/>It might also be more interesting to see what happen when you don't reveal your personal ambition card to the other players. This way it is up to you to fulfill this task without being able to rely on the rest of the group. And then you can reveal it upon completion.<br/><br/>How does that sound?<br/><br/>(And thanks for the compliments on the design)    <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
