I've read it three times, love it, and recommend people buy it just for the text. It's so thoughtful and satisfying, it makes me want to hug someone.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I could do with some help. I'd prefer, of course, answers based on play experience.\n<ul><li>Should I expect pocket-play where each minion's story is independent to the rest?</li>\n<li>Assuming yes to the above, how could I encourage more interaction between minions?</li>\n<li>For a three session conclusion, what scores would you advise for Fear vs. Reason?</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384427/#Comment_384427" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-06T09:13:59+00:00" title="July  6, 2012  9:13AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give the minions individualized tasks, and make the first scene (after they are given that task) highly individualized.  After that, see how much "down-time" they want before reporting back to the master.  The game can be awesome even with pocket-play, if the group is in the mood.  Just trust them to find their groove.<br/><br/>They will usually monitor themselves and ask for scenes with other players when they feel it's right.  If you think a scene should involve a few, you have tools to push towards that too. Have the master make some minions spy on others, stealing items or whatnot.  There's nothing like a Master that sends Oglof after a magic scepter, and then sends Penzig to steal it from Oglof when Oglof stops in the bar to moon over Penny.  That leads to wonderful scenes later as Oglof can't find it, and has to grovel at Master's feet.<br/><br/>Three sessions?  Give them a Fear they can really squirm under; set it to 5.  It makes all of their work for the Master so so easy, even if they are very Weary.  The most profound effect of Reason (for me) has been how many times they will be Captured.  Just judge accordingly.  If you want the minions to work together more, let them get captured more, and have to rescue one another.  (I'd say a 5 fear 3 reason, but that's just me maybe?)<br/><br/>(The flip side of this is when the Master rescues them instead, and abuses them mercilessly for the inconvenience, or when someone from the town sneaks them out of harm.  The best pain is when your victim is the one that has more sympathy for you than your Master.)<br/><br/>Good luck, and report back if you can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384447/#Comment_384447" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-06T15:14:19+00:00" title="July  6, 2012  3:14PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To avoid pocket play: Send Minion A on a task that threatens the interests of Minion B's Connections.<br/><br/>For three sessions: Do not start doing the above until session 2.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384453/#Comment_384453" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-06T16:56:09+00:00" title="July  6, 2012  4:56PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very useful Thanks so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
