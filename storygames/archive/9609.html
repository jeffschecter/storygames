Sounded like a great idea to me!<br/><br/>Here's my first impressions:<br/><br/>1. PKD novels are about identity and what it means in a world of technology;<br/>2. Rarely in RPGs do players have as little clue about what is happening to their characters, internally and externally as PKD protagonists;<br/>3. The best way to mess with a player's "in-character" sense of identity is to take it away, without explicitly stating it at the table;<br/>a. How would you do that? My first effort: allow players to add details to each other's characters, if and only if they can introduce them in casual conversation, without explicitly stating what they are adding. eg: Adam, as Noriega: Wow, Skinner, you look exhausted. Have you been having those dreams about the blonde woman again? Thomas, as Skinner, knowing full well he's never mentioned his character having any such dreams: Uh, yeah. I was up all night with them. They just seem so real! GM: (cackles in insane glee and makes notes about a blonde woman and who she might be).<br/><br/>Thoughts?

In fact, what I've read about APFMT makes it sound right up my alley.<br/><br/>My first thought for an extant system was some kind of <i>Polaris</i> hack with some kind of encouragement to add details about who a character was, regardless of how well it meshed with what had gone before: "But only if you've been having dreams about the Blonde Woman". My worry was that it would be too tricky not to set things up ahead of time and reveal too much when you add details. Although... "but only if the Blonde Woman is someone I've never met..." might make a good twist.<br/><br/>I'll check out the various suggestions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213232/#Comment_213232" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T14:40:47+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  2:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>This would fit really well in Lacuna but there aren't any mechanics to support it in that game.</blockquote>\nI can't believe I forgot Lacuna.

My suggestions will draw on a combination of Seth Ben-Ezra's in-development game <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8445" rel="nofollow">Showdown</a> and John Harper's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9139" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a> (and its influences in turn, especially Burning Wheel and friends).<br/><br/>Suppose that you have a few sentences on your character sheet, all of the form "I think that I am \u03c6" for purely internal sentences \u03c6 ("I think that I am compassionate," not "I think that I have green hair.").  Those are like your hit points; let's use Showdown's terminology and call them Qualities.  If someone succeeds in making an "attack" on your identity (however that works), then the group somehow comes to a consensus (maybe one player proposes and everyone but you has a veto?) on something that will replace one of your Qualities, and you alter your character sheet to read "I think that I am \u03c6 but I'm not; I'm \u03c8" where \u03c8 is the replacement Quality.  Unlike in Showdown, it would be flavorful for the sentence \u03c8 to be something surreally unrelated to the thing it replaces ("I think that I am compassionate, but I'm not; I'm probably the advance guard for an invading force of small gods.")  Replacements can also start to describe your character externally, maybe ("I think that I'm compassionate, but I'm not; I have a second head growing from my chest.")<br/><br/>Idea 2: Each player authors a handful of Dickian Conditions, maybe in the form of predicates ("is somehow the same person as the person to his/her right",  "is infested with a sentient and communicative parasite", "is addicted to Key 17") and pushes them into the center of the table.  When you lose an Identity Test, everyone else at the table chooses one of these Conditions for you.  You add it to your character sheet and you have that Condition, in the Blackbird sense (which is in turn the Burning X sense).  Then you can come up with interesting ways to frame Refreshment/Recovery scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Thanks for the link and kind words about my blog!<br/><br/>It does not surprise me that many people have toyed with writing a Philip K. Dick game. It seems like one of the great un-cracked challenges in game design.  Two and a half years after that original post and I still haven't finished my own PKD rpg but I do noodle around with it from time to time. It has a couple of tracks along which reality bends: identity is one (you are not who you think you are); others involve free will, pattern recognition / paranoia, and the illusory nature of reality. One of the key principles is that the GM can introduce all manner of weird incident and enigma but is specifically prohibited from deciding what it all means, in the same way that a Dogs in the Vineyard GM poses moral quandaries but is not supposed to take a position on the PC's proper course of action.<br/><br/>Ron Edwards had a characteristically incisive (if characteristically grumpy) warning on the problem of the PKD rpg in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17354.0" rel="nofollow">a Forge thread on Steve Hickey's excellent Left Coast</a>:<br/><br/><i>"The subject matter works very well for me, because I think you've hit upon the core issues that drew me to the topic, back in the day. Bluntly, I despise the subset of SF-fandom which adores the ravings of Philip K. Dick, for instance, as if they were gorgeous fantasies. I respond to his fiction because the stories and empathy for others seem to clamber forth, somehow successfully, through the fog of his personal misery and confusion, and I see the stuff the fans seem to like as the fog. Classic Philhead fans appall me with their babble about dimensional shifts and conspiracies; they seem to me to be like vultures or fetishists. It's not the Black Iron Prison or his Exegesis or Valis (as a topic, not the title) that interest me, but the stories about friendships, the betrayals, the groping for a meaning to it all, the misunderstandings, and the desperation - his artistic sensitivity to issues that really matter."</i><br/><br/>My goal would be to write a game that only half appalls Ron: to do the genre justice, you do have to push deeper than the sci-fi window dressing to get to the deep issues that really drove Dick. That said, I <i>like</i> dimensional shifts and alien conspiracies...<br/><br/>I'm in total agreement with what Joshua says right above about Paranoia as the first (wonderful, if flawed) science fiction RPG. Coincidentally (of course there are no coincidences), I mentioned the PKD project just yesterday at the end of <a href="http://clawclawpeck.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/a3-alphaville/" rel="nofollow">a series of alternate Paranoia settings</a> on a friend's gaming blog.  Maybe it's because I just had a second baby, so I'm back in the same sleep-deprived headspace I was in in 2006.<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213741/#Comment_213741" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T12:58:03+00:00" title="June 21, 2009 12:58PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, small world!<br/><br/>Do you mind sharing any mechanical insights you might have had in your multi-year PKD RPG journey?

PKD was more "Holy crap, I'm actually a robot who thinks he's a leprechaun!" and WSB was more "Holy crap, I'm a robot who thinks he's a leprechaun with a heroin addiction and an eyeball growing in the back of my hand and OH MY GOD WHY IS THE BIBLE BLANK?"<br/><br/>Actually, upon second-reading, your game seems very David Lynch, which is another thing to lead to the list of inspirations for <i>Mindfuck</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
