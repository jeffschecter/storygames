Wow!) only to pop in with a directed promotion thread. I hate to do that but, well, I need the exposure AND more, good, directed feedback (and you folks have always been good at both). <br/><br/>Swords of Strange Aeons, as some of you are aware, is a project that I've been working on for a little over nine years in one form or another. The current version (and, indeed, the last version) owe a great debt to Graham Walmsley's <i>Cthulhu Dark</i> and Zak Arntson's <i>Shadows</i>. System-wise, it inhabits a space somewhere between traditional games and story games, borrowing a little from both schools of thought. <br/><br/>I just released the current revision through RPGNow, which is a whole new deal for me. I've been writing and disseminating free-press games for almost 17 years, but I finally put myself out there commercially (plus invested in some artwork, did some actual layout, etc). The rules content of this revision have been released in their entirety under the terms of the OGL and I plan to release a series of PWYW 'hacks' that will allow you to apply the rules to other settings and genres. <br/><br/>The current rules include a number of clarifications made to the previous revision, as well as an all new system for social conflict resolution (though one that stems from the existing conflict resolution system), slightly revised health and damage rules, quick and dirty rules for defining settings, and rules for pushing your physical limits to better your chances of resolving action favorably. <br/><br/>You can check out the old, free, version of the rules, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21527620/sosa2.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>The current, non-free (but super cheap), rules can be found at RPGNow, <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/206629/Swords-of-Strange-Aeons" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>Thanks for your time!<br/><br/>Kind Regards,<br/>James D.
