                            The way I see it:<br/><br/>Pushing is taking an action that you expect will engage other players by inducing them to <i>react</i>, because you're making inaction have in-game consequences that you believe they will not like.<br/><br/>Pulling is taking an action that you expect will engage other players by inducing them to <i>act</i>, because you're making inaction boring compared to moving in and picking up the plot threads you're offering.<br/><br/>Sometimes people will react to something that you intended as a push, as if it were a pull, and vice versa.  Sometimes people will ignore a push or a pull.  Neither of these conditions matter to whether it's a push or pull or something else, because they happen AFTER the push or pull is made.<br/><br/>A push or a pull is a play made with the expectation that it will engage the interest of one or more of the other participants.  It's the play, PLUS the expectation.  Is the expectation a 'feeling'?  Maybe.  It can be instinctive or reasoned, well-considered or impulsive, and may not even be entirely conscious, but it has to be there.<br/><br/>This means that you can't ALWAYS tell whether a particular bit of play was a push or a pull without talking to the people involved, but sometimes it's obvious.                        </div>

                            Hi Tony,<br/><br/>It is something you do.  It is exactly equivalent to assertion and solicitation in normal everyday speech <i>patterns</i>.  I'd really have to do some research to dig up the exact social sciences way of putting it- but we make assertions and solicitations everyday unconsciously in interacting with others.<br/><br/>"How are you doing?" mostly is a greeting, as opposed to an actual solicitation for deeper information.  We expect an equally vapid response, but when we here something like, "Uh, ooo-kkaay... I guess", that's a solicitation in return for us to show sympathy and hear their story (even if that's not what we wanted to begin with).<br/><br/>This is a feature of human communication, it happens with or without our conscious awareness.  It is not surprising that in hobby that functions by way of communication, similar patterns emerge explicitly in dealing with the fictional material.                        </div>

<p>I didn't participate in that other thread, but I read through it and think somewhere along the line the definitions of Push/Pull became a lot more muddy, mostly because of a heavy reliance on a "how you feel" component, which results in fuzzy definitions. I have a deliberately more focussed definition that is "what you do" only, which may make it more appealing to you but might turn off a number of the other people discussing Push/Pull.</p>
<p>I think discussions of exact ontext and the intentions or unspoken desires of the players involved is a red herring, even if this may actually occur in play. I see Push and Pull as actual techniques of roleplaying identified by analogy to "soft" and "hard" martial art techniques. Push is the karate of roleplaying, Pull is the aikido.</p>
<p>The two techniques are about how you, the player, get another player to act in some way. <em>How</em> the other player reacts is unimportant; you are only concerned with <em>what</em> the player reacts to. They are ways of focusing play on specific topics. Push focuses play on a topic by confrontation; Pull focuses by offering a tempting hook.</p>
<p>Examples from a game of Burning Wheel in the Agone setting I played at Dundracon. The supposed focus of play is a nobleman's annual census and inventory of his territory. One player has a satyr character that is descrbed as sex-obsessed. During play, he repeatedly uses magic to seduce the female characters, grabs them and attempts to physically carry them off, and so on. That's Push: he's focusing play on the satyr and his sex-obsession by confronting the other players with actions they can't ignore. The GM at one point attacks the party with spiders; that's another Push. When we selected characters, I chose one nobleman who was described as the Duke's somewhat frivolous cousin; the GM made a slight suggestion to the Duke's player that he he keeps his cousin close to the court because he has no way of knowing if the cousin is just self-absorbed or is plotting against him. That's Pull, since there was no requirement for either of us to act on that suggestion, even though it was an open suggestiona and not subtle. I opted to take that suggestion and twist it a little: the cousin, who was ten years older than the Duke, swore an oath to the Duke's father to protect the Duke, but his own dislike of the young Duke's personality and of getting personally involved in anything makes him choose to carry out his oath as behind-the-scenes manipulation and stealthy behavior. So, I deliberately act many times in an ambiguous manner, staying behind in camp at first as a scouting expedition is sent out, then suddenly following when the Duke decides to join the scouting, and so on. That's Pull; I'm not directly confronting anyone, but I am sublty suggesting interpretations of my character's behavior that could provoke action.</p>
<p>To take your Major Victory example: since it's a demo, you are trying to provoke any kind of engagement with the system at all, especially with Major Victory. Your opening statement is just a characterization of Major Victory inviting the other player to form an opinion and act on it, but isn't a direct confrontation. That's Pull, even if it seems a little pushy (Pull/Push is probably more a matter of degree, anyways, rather than a binary toggle.) Your second statememt is an actual confrontational action, attempting to humiliate the other character: that's Push.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>Cool responses!  Thanks.</p>
<p>Arref, I am not ignoring your actual-play examples, but you're one of the few who offered them, so ... y'know ... I still feel somewhat in the dark about how other people think of the issue.</p>
<p>Just a quick check here:  You people, right here in this thread, seem (to me) to be disagreeing in some pretty fundamental ways.  Which is cool.  I love a good discussion.</p>
<p>But maybe I'm misreading.  Do you think it's fair to characterize this thread as offering several people's distinct (and in some cases incompatible) views on the subject matter?  Or am I seeing differences of opinion where none actually exist?</p>

<p>I am using Push/Pull in the spirit of the original posts on the topic and several of the examples that have been provided, but I am definitely changing the definition when I use it, or at least refining it. I am doing this because I think the definitions already in circulation don't agree, and because those definitions include concepts that I think prevents agreement.</p>
<p>I'm not specifically disagreeing with anything in this thread, though. Arref didn't provide a definition in this thread, so I'd have to go back to the other thread to see how close his usage is to mine. I'm not finding anything extremely disagreeable about Vaxalon's comment, although I'm focussing it in a different way and think discussing expectation is a red herring; yes, you are expecting certain reactions, but that's always true. I'm not sure about Chris's definition, because he starts out saying something that's close to what I said, but his example doesn't seem to relate to his definition.</p>
<p>I think Thomas, Brand, Ben, and Emily have all said things that are in agreement with what I am saying, but they have some feeling components that make Push/Pull more subjective and thus harder to define. I want to eliminate those subjective components.</p>

                            See, that's where I disagree. I think it's easier to not worry about your intentions too much (am I doing X because I expect a strong reaction, or because it's just what I want to do?) That opens the door to hard-to-categorize actions.<br/>
<br/>
It's much easier to just ask "did that action direcctly change another player's character or one of their resources?" If yes, it's Push. If no, it's Pull. Sometimes, you do two or more things simultaneously, so it's possible to Push and Pull at the same time, or Push one person and Pull another.                        </div>

I can get behind the above.

<p>Talysman:  Let me test whether I'm grokking what you're saying, with actual play:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>I ran an Amber game ("Will of Kings") in which Oberon was going all senile, and people were jockeying for position as he got ready to name his successor.  So I would insert something like "King Oberon's physician suggests that he take the medicinal waters at Shanna'Ur" and I'd have some bitchy NPC trying to be the one to "selflessly" nursemaid her poor, dear, ailing father ... and I'd dump this directly into one player's lap, and say "Well, it's no harm to you if you let her get away with that, except that she might move one step closer to Oberon's doddering heart, and you won't."  Then I'd see how they responded.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So it strikes me that by your definition, my dangling that opportunity is not directly changing another player's character or one of their resources, so it's Pull.  Am I reading you correctly?</p>

                            Aren't the players jockeying for position, too? If they are, Oberon is a shared resource, a method to the throne. The NPC shutting off access to Oberon is Pull if the PCs haven't been jockeying for Oberon's attention; it's Push, otherwise. Once you Pull with Oberon and someone responds, any further changes to Oberon count as Push for all who have staked a claim.<br/>

Of course, I'm assuming here that the bitchy NPC is controlling access to Oberon. If not, it's pure Pull. But I've come to the conclusion, based on your actual play examples, that you're never a pure Pull kind of guy, Tony...                        </div>

                            Based on that understanding of push/pull, though, the only way you could ever be a "pure pull" player is to never actually change anything that's "owned" by anyone else. Which sounds suspiciously like solitaire play.                        </div>

                            I've played "all pull" before... there's a GMing style that involves doing nothing but leaving plot threads lying around for the PC's to investigate.  After they bite, you only push when an NPC wants you to.                        </div>

                            Fred, NPCs are still using your narrative power. Unless you're also playing conflictless games, even that kind of "open" GM-ing relies on SOME kind of intrusion on the players' turf. Or is this purely tourism? (Look, but don't touch)                        </div>

<p>Well, actually, I wasn't talking about that.  Though, y'know, the whole access thing is a great tack, which a player jumped on hard.  But it wasn't anything that I did as a GM.  No, I think in this case it was pretty much what you'd call "Pure Pull."</p>
<p>What do you think about the issue of relative advantage?  Like, if I'm playing D&amp;D and I miss <em>all</em> my opportunities to gain XPs, while other players level up pretty constantly then there's a sort of creeping deflation of my abilities.  They don't get reduced (my first-level character is just as buff as he's ever been) but the rest of the world gets increased, which means that those same character abilities no longer lend me the same authority as a player ... my Magic Missile spell doesn't let me wow folks when we're fighting Frost Giants the way it did when we were fighting a Giant Rat, y'know?</p>

Relative advantage as a 'do'?<br/>Relative advantage as a 'Pull / Push'?<br/>Relative advantage as a 'feel'?<br/><br/>I'm not sure where you are going with that so I can't answer.<br/><br/><br/>ps: How are you coding the yellow quotes as opposed to the blockquote I am?                        </div>

<p>Arref:  Well, Talysman is offering a definition (which I don't <em>think</em> is agreed on by everyone, but I'm engaging with him) that says "Something is a Pull, no matter intention, intonation, perception or whatever, if it does not directly change another player's character or their resources.</p>
<p>So I'm asking what he thinks of the question of relative advantage, in that context.  'cuz it seems relevant to what would be considered pull and what would be considered push.</p>
<p>Like, in the Amber example I was discussing:  there's a school of thought which says "Letting my rival get closer to the throne <em>weakens me</em>, because her success raises the bar in terms of how much I need to achieve to be at her level.  While I stand still she's going to leave me in the dust."</p>
<p>It strikes me as a possibly wierd, fuzzy area in Talysman's definition of Push/Pull, so I figured I'd ask how he sees it.</p>
<p>p.s. I get the yellow quotes by nesting a block of text inside of backwards quotes (under the "~" character on my keyboard).</p>

I was talking about how ONE participant in a game, the GM specifically, could play "all pull" with players willing to play along.                        </div>

                            Hey guys, also Mo said that she was going to come back after some thought to tighten up her definition with some more expanatory text and a few game examples.<br/><br/>I think that's a great opportunity to wait for her answers, then:<br/><br/>1) Set those answers in stone.<br/><br/>2) Find the behaviors we witnessed that didn't fit into her model that still somehow feel like "pushing" or "pulling" and come up with a secondary model, or at least give those behaviors names.  Or they might roll up into push/pull.<br/><br/>In any case, I wouldn't go forward racking your brains too hard.  Since Mo started the avelanche, I'm gonna support her efforts to "funnel" it for Round Two, where she explains the ideas (and puts it to the table with solid examples). <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
