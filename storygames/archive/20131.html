I dig the system, but there are a few things that I wanted to simplify for this new game I've been working on. Love the investigation aspect, running a structured mystery and all that, but I found myself wanting something a bit more fast and loose when the PCs were doing other stuff. I ran a session of <i>Blades in the Dark</i>, and found that I enjoyed the countdown clocks on Conditions so came up with this. I've seen a bunch of threads about GUMSHOE so I was hoping for some feedback and any thoughts. Here's what I've got so far:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/UuIMCiE.jpg"/><br/><br/>Players show what skills they have by highlighting them, then they distribute points among the highlighted skills.<br/><br/>Spending points buys you an auto success. If you have no points you can choose to either take a Condition, or choose to forego a Condition but the GM will escalate the danger in some way. A Condition can be either mental or physical, and suits the situation, are removed when they're addressed in the fiction.<br/><br/>The set-up in the game is that in the far future law enforcement farms out cases they can't solve to consultants at various agencies due to a general lack of manpower for various reasons. PCs work for one such consultant agency, and the game is set in Korea, where they've figured out how to implant skills by using "mind maps" to map neural patterns that correspond to the learning of certain skills. <br/><br/>Of course, in order to implant the memories they've got to screw around in there, take out existing memories and use existing strong pattern maps (though temporary maps are possible) so once you wake up from one of these you're essentially a different person with different memories and different wiring, and skill varies too, of course. So PCs are able to go to Memory Lane and mess with the memories or get skills implanted they need, but there'll be consequences that should add a fun angle to things I think, and should allow for consequences during Investigative scenes as well. I really wanted to add a dimension of having to explore and get to know your body and add an additional personal level to mysteries so I'm looking forward to playtesting.<br/><br/>Any thoughts would be much appreciated!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444646/#Comment_444646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T11:16:10+00:00" title="April  8, 2015 11:16AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the way you've adapted the mechanics to thematically meld with your setting. I'm also working on a system inspired by GUMSHOE, but it still retains the fundamental idea that you automatically succeed at certain things, without having to spend any points. <br/><br/>Regarding your system, I have a general distaste for "new danger appears" mechanics but I know I'm in the minority there. I'm uncertain of the necessity of "effect". You liked the countdown clocks, but one thing I always liked about GUMSHOE is the freeform problem solving, from the "asking questions" nature of investigation to  the flexible application of skills. You think about how you're going to overcome your task, rather than rolling dice and waiting for the wheel to fill up.<br/><br/>But, if you're trying to do something very different with GUMSHOE and are mostly looking for adjustments on mechanics, I'd say that you have too few "highlights" and "points" to spend. Also, I'm not sure why one would choose to Fail? Essentially, you'll only attempt that action if you want to succeed at it, unless there are situations where they are forced to make such actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444647/#Comment_444647" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T11:28:36+00:00" title="April  8, 2015 11:28AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2015 11:40AM by kksimons.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely need to do a lot of playtesting to see what a good sweet spot for highlights and points are but I like the idea of points scarcity to either force them to try another skill, or to force them to take consequences doing the cool things they do. I guess "choose" was a poor choice of words, just thought it sounded a bit more like it was in your hands, as a player. Number of players and how many clues/expected length of game will have to play some role here as well. Do you have recommendations in terms of amount of points?<br/><br/>As for "new danger appears" I'm going to have something like GM moves, so they've got some suggestions for what to do. I was thinking it could just be the equivalent of a hard move, where a new faction gets introduced, or whatever they like. They'd be able to choose what kind of a move to make as they like, bringing in something new (but that still builds on the fiction), or escalating existing variables.<br/><br/>I don't see countdown clocks being used for everything - clues wouldn't use clocks I imagine, mostly Conditions. Certainly mental ones that should take some time in both addressing and resolving, rather than being able to resolve them quite so simply. All challenges would be made up of a certain amount of segments, along with however-many segments for Conditions affecting their character at the moment they need to resolve as well.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting it to take away from the freeform problem solving, things like clues won't have clocks like I said, but they'd still spend a point to get extra action during the scene. They might push themselves to get extra goodies despite having no points as well, but take a Condition (maybe they get the clue, but it throws them off, shakes them psychological in some way so they take a Condition clock on that. Or they see a woman pass by in a red blazer that sparks a memory and a "side quest" and that could be on a clock as they try to remember what it's about, that kind of thing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444649/#Comment_444649" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T11:40:54+00:00" title="April  8, 2015 11:40AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be uncertain about the "pushing themselves" when finding clues.

Again, they feel kind of contrived. I don't <i>mind</i> things like "move x clock forward 1" or escalating the danger of an existing threat, but when I start the scene, these are the threats. You work out how to overcome them, you don't get halfway through and then a completely unrelated action narratively somehow mechanically causes Godzilla to burst through the wall.

What I was thinking of for danger in clue-finding was the mental side of things. It's also up to the player how their character reacts, by spending points or not, or pushing themselves or not. Since the setting is about constantly erasing and rewriting your identity and memories to an extreme degree, likely each case, I think there's ample opportunity there to explore personal implications in what's going in the fiction. Things triggering true or false memories, or being affected by a crime scene different this time for some reason, psychological and mental triggers. Which is not to say that that stuff can't be explored after clue locations and when danger is obvious and apparent, but I like the idea of setting up personal "side-quests" and personal exploration along the way as well, especially when it's player driven. I'm more interested in breaking away from the stoic, highly-skilled and calloused investigator vibe, but it'll be player driven via point spends mostly. If they don't want to go that route they can be more creative with spends, find ways to refresh (which I'm also working on), or just forego the extra tidbits for fear of consequences.<br/><br/>I admit it needs some playtesting though, so we'll see. I agree that the mechanics should respond to narrative events and should fit within the fiction - unrelated narrative events taking place is usually when the GM needs to make a move, but tries to be clever rather than rolling with existing danger and obvious implications. I think that's less a mechanics problem, and more a GM issue with responding to a list of ideas, not having anything in mind at that instant, and maybe wanting to be clever and start introducing other elements. I'm guilty of that myself when I play in AW-powered stuff but it's easy to address once you've identified it. Good advice is probably the best advice for this, but I will definitely consider limiting options and suggestions for certain scenes!\n<blockquote>Interesting stuff!

You draft a set number of cards for skills, so in a smaller group you get more skills per player, and in a larger group you get fewer skills per player.  But always more or less the same number of skills for the group as a whole (this is similar to standard Gumshoe's advice).<br/><br/>When investigating in Medical Bay Three, the bottleneck isn't having tokens to spend so much as worrying about the Stress mechanic.  Investigation while you have Stress pushes you toward your inevitable doom, so players have to ration out their clue gathering.  (They can also have intra-party interactions in order to shuffle around the Stress, but that's another matter.)  Nonetheless, the mechanic exists to make it difficult to just try every skill until one works, causing the players to make meaningful decisions about what skill to use in each situation.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me as most similar to your game was that when you don't have the appropriate skill, you can still buy a success by taking on additional problems.  (The specifics are a bit different I guess.)  For investigation, this means that the player can always get the clues they need, rather than relying on fickle dice rolls, but it isn't a simple gimme every time.  I think that is important and useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444673/#Comment_444673" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T19:37:38+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  7:37PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the skill points system, I like how you are allowing automatic successes with general skills.

The thing I'm most unsure about right now is number of points per player, but I've also got drafts up for a simple subsystem for chases and hacking/cryptography, which would allow for something hopefully like NBA with colorful moments throughout, but a swifter resolution. <br/><br/>For refreshes I was thinking of having the player have some pre-made stuff the GM can draw on for that character having to do with lost or purposefully deleted memories, ghost personalities, unfamiliarity with one's body and the uncanny in general, that kind of thing. Engaging those elements and generating a personal "side-quest" or tangential arc might be fun and would be good cause for fiction-based refresh I think.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444692/#Comment_444692" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T03:43:21+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  3:43AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>With the skill points system, I like how you are allowing automatic successes with general skills.

In any case, and while what you say makes some sense, I think on a deeper level what's going on in a player's head and how they manage their point economy is going to be different. Probability of success allows for spends where you don't actually get what you want, plus this might mean rolls where you can't guarantee success regardless if you don't allocate points between skills in multiplies of 3. This way it's more like a spotlight mechanic the player has control and certainty over, I think. We'll see what that looks like and how many points need spreading around as I continue to playtest though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444695/#Comment_444695" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T05:45:12+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  5:45AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, the actual difficulty numbers are not germane in this case - spend all 8 of your Guns pool in NBA and you can shoot, once, anything in the game. <br/><br/>That is, if you spend "enough points", you can guarantee success a limited number of times until you refresh your pool. <br/>So with the investigative abilities, that nebulous "enough" is reified to a specific amount: 1 point.<br/><br/>(Even "failing" provides a benefit if you spend the necessary amount for certain general ability purposes.

You just spend 3 skill points on the task - and investigative skills are general skills that you're forced to spend in multiples of 3. <br/><br/></blockquote>\nI'd like to get away from the "unsaid" part.  Why not have general skills succeed all the time?  At least at some level, such as with Cthulhu Dark where the d6 roll determines the range from barely successful (success with cost) to successful with bonuses.  I realize there has to be some tension in the game through uncertainty; I'm just not sure if the uncertainty has to be through the actions typically resolved through general skills (fights, chases, etc.)  As the GM, I want the characters to win these events, just as I want the characters (and players) to have the information found in the clues. A good compromise is a limited number of guaranteed successes through spending some number of points from a finite pool but I think Gumshoe should take a leap of faith and treat general skills similarly to investigative skills.  The hard part, perhaps, becomes making that interesting.  I sometimes think that would be getting too far away from Gumshoe as it currently is.  However, as others have pointed out, you can guarantee success with general skills in Gumshoe for some finite number of times by spending enough points.  I suppose the design philosophy may be that players should save points for when success is vital--but, in a fight or other contest, when isn't it?  Even if the success is vital for the character concept.  It makes no sense to struggle in fights with underlings (by conserving skill points) and then become more competent when facing the prime antagonist.  And, in any case, pools are quickly depleted.  That's why I ask about conflict vs task resolution.  Since I am proposing general skills always are successful, why not cut to the chase and resolve the entire conflict at once?  At that point I throw up my hands and go back to the rules as written (more or less!).  Again, I like the compromise in the OP, which basically comes to three options:  succeed (by spending a point), succeed with conditions, fail (which I think I would change to "fail on player's terms".  Currently, it seems to really be "fail with conditions" and so is too similar to "succeed with conditions.")  I think this is a good mechanic, and one I would use for resolving complete conflicts rather than single actions.<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444707/#Comment_444707" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T13:14:39+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  1:14PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>I'd like to get away from the "unsaid" part.

Yeah, it sounds the hack is staying well within the desired intention and philosophy then. <br/><br/>I playtested it again this weekend and the players had a lot of fun. I only asked them to roll for effect for non-investigative stuff, or when taking or dishing out a Condition. The number of points seemed to be ok with 3 players and me GMing, but maybe a bit much. It's hard to tell since the players were used to more narrative-style games so were totally fine with, and only to happy to, take Conditions on despite having points to spend to avoid them.<br/><br/>I had refreshing points set-up so that they could choose 3 skills, but had to play out a personal scene to get the refresh. I designed a second page for the character sheet where they can write in lost memories, and new memories. Right now I have it so they can either:<br/><br/>1) Gain a pool of 3 points they can use as they like (even temporarily use a skill they don't have on hand as long as the memory referenced involves the skill) by tying the memory to the case at hand. <br/>2) Refresh 3 general skills by showing how the character recovers, blows off steam, or leans on a vice or source of stability.<br/><br/>I enjoyed having everything player facing so I didn't have to roll and could focus all on the story, even if I didn't prep probably as much as I should have! I also made up a cool map to use after the game. Didn't get a chance to use it so far, but next playtest I'm hoping it'll add in an extra fun element and I'm going to write up some fun rules to generate an adventure by rolling randomly on the map, making a pattern on the map, or using key locations for DaVinci Code-style adventures where clues lead them to different locations, or they can see by where they mark on the map a pattern that begins to emerge.<br/><br/>Here are the sheets I made up, along with an example for how I hope the map will work:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/6KRWVJ9.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/kzyIPUr.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/xeln6oX.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/E1eoGib.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444766/#Comment_444766" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-12T17:50:18+00:00" title="April 12, 2015  5:50PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really dig the hex-grid you've used here... what did you use to generate it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444770/#Comment_444770" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T01:28:32+00:00" title="April 13, 2015  1:28AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I really dig the hex-grid you've used here... what did you use to generate it?</blockquote>\nI actually started out with a map of England in 1851 and then screwed around with it in Illustrator until it looked something like part of Seoul.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444772/#Comment_444772" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T02:00:48+00:00" title="April 13, 2015  2:00AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2015 2:03AM by Coalhada.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like that style of mainly-blank map to start with, so that after you've introduced a new place you can do callbacks, or associate NPCs with a particular place.

These days I can only play for a 3 hours or so at a time, so it's a rare occasion that we can wrap things up neatly in just one session, even if it's a one-shot. I think the map should help for multiple session, bigger scope stuff, and hopefully is just fun in general to have in front of people!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
