The concept (and the text) was simplicity in itself: football players and their lives on and off the pitch.  For a guy like me, who catches every Manchester United match he can manage to see on American TV, and who has a thing for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Team_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">Dream Team</a>, it seemed the perfect fit.<br/><br/>So the game's a little rough.  It's ripe for playtesting, right?  So that's what we did, wrangling up a batch of 20-sided dice, some scraps of paper and a few pencils.  We settled in around the table and told this story....<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>One major advantage up front is that <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/up-go-the-heads" rel="nofollow">Up Go the Heads</a> is GM-free.  If you're a gamer like me, who has limited opportunities to play, the easier it is to get everyone having a good time, the better.  I view being the GM as being the facilitator of everyone else's fun, and while it can be fulfilling, I don't know a single GM who doesn't wish he got more time as a player.<br/><br/>We had three characters, all members of the fictional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_One" rel="nofollow">Football League One</a> team, Crofton FC.  There was Robbie Hargreaves, our nominal star, the striker who wanted to be the winningest in league history.  There was the Scottish midfielder Ewan McLean, whose ambition was to rise to the top ranks of Scottish footballers.  And then there was the Welshman, John Davies, the one with the most modest desire: to be the footballer who never let his side down.<br/><br/>The game allows for two different sorts of dice to be used.  I happen to have a lot of d20s and, as the rules themselves say, a d20 is more "football-shaped," so we decided to go with them over the six-sided dice.  It certainly makes for more "successful" results where EGO and TALENT are advanced as opposed to ones where HUBRIS and EXPECTATION are advanced.  We considered this a good thing, though one of the players did go down in flames.  I'll reveal who at the end of the post.<br/><br/>At first it was a little difficult for us to get used to the scene-framing necessary to the game.  We had a lot of Match scenes early in the game because those were easier to get a handle on.  The same was true of Training scenes.  Everybody understood how to dramatize a training montage.<br/><br/>Eventually we started getting into more Gossip scenes and that's when things started to blossom creatively.  Interestingly enough, we expected Hargreaves to be the one who'd be hardest hit by failed rolls.  Maybe that's because his Demons of hard-drinking and womanizing are the ones most commonly attributed to footballers.  It turned out that McLean was the one who consistently blew rolls, or didn't make it outside of the +5 zone, so we spent a lot of time figuring out how his ferocious temper would manifest itself.  He got a lot of red cards during those Match scenes, let me tell you.<br/><br/>Davies had the most success and lived up to his promise as a solid, dependable football player.  For a little while it looked like Hargreaves might burn out, but it was McLean who tipped the scales at seven for his HUBRIS and led to the endgame.  Hargreaves got to realize his dream to be the winningest striker and Davis never let down his side.  McLean ended up tangling with the manager and that can only mean one thing: ouster.  He ended his career playing for a team in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_National" rel="nofollow">Conference National</a>, still racking up red cards and finally growing too unpredictable to hold down a first team position at all.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/up-go-the-heads" rel="nofollow">Up Go the Heads</a> is a very simple game, but that's because it's focused squarely on producing one particular kind of story.  It's definitely not for those who don't have a grounding in football and its perennial gossip, but those who do will have a good time.  I'm certainly glad I got a chance to play, even though my character was the one who went down in a blaze of ignominy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266962/#Comment_266962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T14:37:57+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  2:37PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conference National?

You designate a particular scene a Match scene and then you can load however much (or little) expectation you want into it.  So for example it could be just another game and you roll see how well it went, or it could be a crucial match for one reason or the other.  There's not any of the back and forth flow that's present in actual matches.\n<blockquote>This reminds me that I'd sometimes wondered about using Contenders for a game like this.</blockquote>\nOn a bare bones level it's like <i>Contenders</i> in that there are specific scene types that provide the initial framework for the action.  It's not like <i>Contenders</i> in that <i>Contenders</i> makes some effort to replicate what goes on in the ring.  <i>Up Go the Heads</i> makes it all a function of one set of dice rolls and that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267194/#Comment_267194" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T17:44:30+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  5:44PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1<br/><br/>When I played it we narrated the first half of a game or so and then at a pivotal moment (first 15 mins of the second half, right?) go to the dice. (Having said that I knew a journalist for the Sun who could "call" a game after seeing the first five minutes.
