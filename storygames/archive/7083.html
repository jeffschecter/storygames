It was just the demo scenario Fires Over Omac, but it was a good intro to the game. I know I screwed up some stuff, but regardless, it was an interesting and fun game. I can see it has a lot of depth to it that we only barely got into. Yet even without the player investment in the world (through the world burning process) the group got into the story that developed.<br/><br/>We ran out of time (we were playing at our FLGS and they closed up at 10pm) in the middle of our first firefight, which was an assault on the OPRC prison complex. I bit off a bit more than I could chew by having more than one unit on each side (there were two per side) but it was moving along smartly (as smartly as we could anyway). We had to stop just as the players' Iron platoon had jumped onto the gatehouse to engage the Warden's troops, and the rebel army was coming over the walls, led by the Kerrn General. It was just getting good!<br/><br/>I really did like the scene economy, and the way it forced certain choices to be made regarding what to do with them. The story built itself very organically, and it made sense. It was a little hard for people to grasp what they could do with the different types of scenes but we were starting to get it toward the end. One question I had was if your side only gets one Conflict scene per maneuver, does it mean you need to avoid any "conflict" at all on the way to it? No minor fistfights? No minor arguments? I suppose those could be done with color or interstitials, and even building scenes, but it did seem to make everyone shy away from anything that might have led to a premature confrontation. Can there be any violence or shouting on the way to the big Conflict scene?<br/><br/>But all in all, I loved the game, and I'm really eager to play a full campaign (though I may never have the time - I can barely make a session once a month).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve%20H" title="Steve H"><img alt="Steve H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve%20H">Steve H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157562/#Comment_157562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-20T02:04:22+00:00" title="July 20, 2008  2:04AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can actually sneak in a second conflict scene if the narrative demands it (p428) I take Conflict Scene to mean a scene where you engage the Duel of Wits or Firefight mechanics you could use versus tests for those less significant conflicts.

You just don't engage the full conflict system. For violence, use the I Corner Him and Stab Him in the Face! rules (I'd give you a page citation, but I don't have my book here). For arguments, do a Persuasion versus test (or similar). Each side states intent and you roll. If you want to convince someone of something and the other side just wants to resist, you roll your Persuasion (or whatever) with an obstacle equal to your opponent's Will.<br/><br/>You can also have great arguments in Interstitial scenes.

I'll certainly try to keep that in mind and do it that way in the future though. I guess the difference is what's at stake - if the violence or argument isn't really about the main goal of the maneuver, it can be resolved quickly with one roll, and no need for the full-on Conflict scene.\n<blockquote>You can also have great arguments in Interstitial scenes. They just won't hold mechanical weight.</blockquote>\nRoger that. Without this insight I found it hard to do the Interstitials sometimes because I wanted to argue but I thought any argument would become a DOW and I didn't want to go there until the big scene itself, so I felt like I was really holding back a lot of times. Actually I think we all felt that. Didn't make it any less enjoyable, we just weren't sure how far we could go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157618/#Comment_157618" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-20T15:20:43+00:00" title="July 20, 2008  3:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two thoughts on conflicts and the scene economy:<br/><br/>First, each side has access to an optional second conflict.<br/><br/>Second, if you can resolve a conflict with a single roll, you can stuff it into your regular building scene budget.
