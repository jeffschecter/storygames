Two of the characters have known the mission from the beginning, while a third has just found out the full nature of the bombing run as the play clock starts. They have to decide what to do in the last 7 minutes before the point of no return.<br/><br/>If two characters are agreed on a course of action, the third cannot stop them.<br/><br/>It was quite intense from my perspective, probably in no small part due to the fact that this is the first of my games that's ever been play(test)ed, so I was nervous about that. I had to go sit at another table, and I didn't feel comfortable looking up from scrabbling notes for the whole 7 minutes.<br/><br/>The Pilot (played by Joel), had just found out the nature of the mission as play started, and argued with his Commander about what to do. The Commander held fast the whole time, while the Bombardier (Ben) sat on the fence and was quiet most of the time, until the Pilot looked to him for agreement on aborting the mission and turning around. He wavered as the seconds ticked down, and finally gave in, aborting the mission.<br/><br/>When 1 minute is left on the clock, the Commander has to give an order one way or the other, and he forcibly told them to continue the mission, and drop the bomb. They didn't. The last few seconds ticked down in silence.<br/><br/>After the clock runs out, on the way back from the mission, each character can say one sentence. The Pilot said something like "I'm sorry, Commander." The Bombardier paused, and shook his head. The Commander said something like, "You don't know how fucked you are right now."<br/><br/>And that was it. Joel said something about it being "intense", and there was a little talk afterward, but I don't remember it. If anyone who played wants to hop in and comment, that would be great.<br/><br/>It was nerve-wracking listening to it, and playing it too, I imagine.<br/><br/>Was it good? Was it <i>fun</i>? I don't know. As I was pitching it to people my behind-the-keyboard courage failed and I almost felt like it was a total mistake to even write the thing. One other possible player opted out "for personal reasons," which is very legit.<br/><br/>I will say, the game is not about judging history and those in it. It's about inserting ourselves into an incredibly charged situation (charged both for the characters and the players), and seeing what decisions we make, and what that feels like. Think of it as a roleplaying poem, I suppose.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350749/#Comment_350749" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T00:57:49+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 12:57AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a damn good poem!

Have the 2 players help the 3rd player develop an everyday soldier character.  Then, sit the three of them down and give them the scenario.  That way, the 3rd really has no clue what's coming but already has a "character" in mind who can react.  Meanwhile, the other two know full well what is coming.<br/><br/>Also, this would have been an awesome classroom activity during highschool (This occurs to me because I grew up in Oak Ridge, TN).  You send 1/3 of the class outside, explain, then bring the others back in and pair them up with 2 others.  Then, after the 7 minutes, poll the class about their games and have each person write a personal diary entry from the perspective of later that night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350760/#Comment_350760" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T06:55:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  6:55AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

They knew they were ending the war and saving millions of lives. <br/><br/>It probably helped that they had already participated in the fire bombing of Tokyo - killing more people than the Atom bomb did.

The game's not a moral test, first. You could say that it's broken because it doesn't have that stuff, or that it would be a better game with it, but I think about it in the same way as I think about something like a high luck-based dice game. It's fine and works if it's short, it doesn't if it's long. This would be a terrible hour-long game, but I think it works at 7 minutes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350793/#Comment_350793" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T12:55:14+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 12:55PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good idea for a game!<br/><br/>Testing the willingness of members of soldiers &amp; civiian leaders to launch nuclear weapons was/is a chilling real world dilemma that was connected to game theory early in the cold war.

Which isn't to say it wouldn't be interesting to play out, but it doesn't feel like a moral simulation to me either, because at least from my own cultural perspective there is near-total consensus on an almost emotional level that dropping the bomb was a catastrophe.

But of course, lots of people did make those sorts of moral decisions, even if the context that allowed them to do so now seems extremely remote to us. I'm not really sure it's possible to elegantly provide that sort of context, though, short of players who already know something about the historical/military situation at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350811/#Comment_350811" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T14:15:55+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  2:15PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

The idea for example of substituting an ahistorical, invented scenario for the Enola Gay scenario seems like it's just designing some other game, largely unrelated to this one.<br/><br/>Jonathan's response re: characters all deciding to drop the bomb is an interesting one. My initial impression of the game was that it wasn't the sort of game where you take on a character and adopt their worldview completely, but something closer to a character-as-surrogate approach where you put a slightly-modified version of yourself into a historical situation and see what it's like. The sparsity of the questions seemed to support that, but it could be that I simply misread the game, or (see last paragraph) that we both just read it differently. <br/><br/>Now obviously the questions are still adequate to produce a different-enough version of myself that I could play a pro-bombing character -- I would just have to come up with a really strong answer to 'why do you obey orders?' and focus on that in play. My feeling was mostly that people would do this largely out of dramatic obligation, rather than personal preference, if they imagined that the game was about a moral decision-point. Including a question that aims at this moral context/experience would (I think) allow for a slightly wider variety of play.<br/><br/>In general, I think for a 7 minute game, the fact that two groups might play it based off completely different assumptions is a major plus, and not something to be scrubbed-out or worried about. The question of what happens when different players within a group approach it differently is maybe a bit more of a concern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350856/#Comment_350856" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T19:24:47+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  7:24PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2011 7:26PM by Hans_c-o.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>but something closer to a character-as-surrogate approach where you put a slightly-modified version of yourself into a historical situation and see what it's like</blockquote>\nThis has been <i>exactly</i> my intent pretty much since the beginning.

So, you're baring your own ideals and morals, but through the guise of a character. Still, it seems it would be mostly about you.<br/><br/>I like the way it is, as written! <br/><br/>And I disagree that it's a given that no one would drop the bomb. I'm pretty that, at least in North America (and possibly Europe), a lot of people are *very happy* about the way things turned out (the war ending, both the USA and Japan now being developed, prosperous nations at peace with one another). So, the "modern" angle can be used to argue FOR dropping the bomb.<br/><br/>And I know a LOT of people who would definitely argue that the right decision was made, even given the "modern" viewpoint.<br/><br/>All this just makes the game more interesting, to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350860/#Comment_350860" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T20:02:40+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  8:02PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I admit after I wrote what I did about how there being "near-total consensus" regarding the dropping of the atomic bomb, I thought about going back and hedging further -- obviously I was speaking for my own small-c personal culture, which while North American is not US-American. I also very specifically said "emotional level" because while I feel there are definitely many people who can intellectually justify dropping the bomb as a military action, there are very few who would <i>feel</i> particularly good about the idea, and in the sort of 7-minute-pressure situation I kind of expect emotionality to rule the day. By comparison, circa 1945 I imagine there were a huge number of people who would emotionally, viscerally feel that bombing Japan was not only acceptable but admirable, even triumphant.<br/><br/>Then again I really don't know that there's much the game can do, in the space of an elegant question or two, to reveal those emotional possibilities to players in the same way that the 'following orders' or 'fearing the commander' questions can reveal similar possibilities. I think the suggested questions about knowing someone who has been killed is definitely the closest/most likely avenue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350868/#Comment_350868" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T22:08:49+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 10:08PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2011 10:10PM by jackson_tegu.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Firstly, Hans, outstanding. <br/><br/>I first heard of this game while staying up far too late with some very lovely people, and got the good-freaky-chills after one of them told me that you made this masterpiece. I haven't played it yet, but i am excited to.<br/><br/>including Daniel: we, the story-games crowd and convention goers in particular, make up a very diverse group. I bet that there are folks who would have very diverse opinions about that bombing, or other bombings; and furthermore, that they'd all assume a consensus with their own viewpoint while heading into it. Now those, those would be an intense seven minutes.<br/><br/>&amp; Christopher weeks, you said\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>What concerns do you face writing a game about specific real people with close living relatives?

They touch many people, and everyone that those moments touch is part owner to them. The crew of the Enola Gay are not people now, they are ideas.

It's alt-history about the Little Boy mission, treading on the same ground as you are here.  It's a good read.  Wish it was available for reading online...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>By comparison, circa 1945 I imagine there were a huge number of people who would emotionally, viscerally feel that bombing Japan was not only acceptable but admirable, even triumphant.</blockquote>\nYou are understating things.<br/><br/>The 1945 American mindset is that the Pacific war is a long way from done.  The Allies have demanded unconditional surrender, which puts the Emperor himself in jeopardy, so everyone expects Japan to fight on.  That means the next move is going to be the invasion of Japan itself, which is going to be a catastrophe on the order of many Stalingrads.<br/><br/>If you're an American serviceman, you are rightly terrified of this.  You know that Iwo Jima and Okinawa have been corpse factories and that the home islands will be even gnarlier.  You've heard that millions of civilian levies are set to charge the landing beaches with bamboo spears in hand and land mines strapped to their chests, and that the entire Japanese Army is dug in behind them.  You know your enemy has got nowhere to retreat and they don't care if they live as long as you die.<br/><br/>And then suddenly, thanks to these mighty silver superbombers and their mighty payloads, the war is over.  You're not going to die!  Your father / husband / son is going to come home safe!  Imagine today if a million cancer patients all simultaneously received a miracle injection that put them in remission.  Triumphant doesn't cover it -- how about utter ecstatic jubilation!  Urban riots!  Fucking in the streets!<br/><br/>In this atmosphere, I don't think many Americans really gave a shit about what had been done to the Japanese in order to induce their surrender.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.Walton</cite>I have a suspicion that, playing with most of the folks I know, dropping the bomb would be agreed upon pretty quickly, especially since the setup makes it seem like the intent is to play in character</blockquote>\nMy knee-jerk reaction is similar.<br/><br/>By the time of HIroshima, any B-29 veteran would have plenty of blood on his hands, and also would have had ample opportunity to explore conscientious objection or mutiny in lieu of being a bomber crewman. The USAAF had inflicted Katrina-type damage on a <i>national scale.</i>  They were running out of targets.<br/><br/>So yeah, if I'm playing any of these characters, each hardened by war, each frightened for their future, and each chosen for their reliability<sup>1</sup> and competence, then I feel like I can't justify not dropping the bomb.<br/><br/><b>edit:</b> except that I just re-read the rules more carefully and I see that I am supposed to play a <b>fictional</b> character.  And that little tiny suggestion of creative liberty makes me realize that I don't know which way I would go if I played this game.  I don't have to be true to the history, I don't have to be true to my own morals and judgments, I have to be true to the tiny fictional reality we make in those seven minutes. Nice job, Hans.  I think I definitely want to give this a shot. <br/><br/><sup>1</sup> <sub>which compels me to link to <a href="http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/i/armstrong/" rel="nofollow">my favourite alt-history story ever.</a>  It reveals what happens when less reliable pilots are sent on epoch-defining missions.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351083/#Comment_351083" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T08:27:03+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  8:27AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2011 8:27AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone ever played a character who proposed a different outcome along the lines of dropping the bomb on the sea or some uninhabited area within view of the Japanese?

Petrov judged that the report was a false alarm. This decision may have prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its Western allies. Investigation later confirmed that the satellite warning system had malfunctioned.</blockquote>\nGreat idea - it would be particularly stressful if one were to determine randomly whether or not the launch warning is in fact real, with the result not being revealed until the launch decision is made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
