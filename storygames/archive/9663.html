And I came upon this one weird turning point in the way I think of games that I think might deserve, well, bein noted.<br/><br/>Many years ago, I played Heavy Gear. And our game was blessed with an entertaining assortment of characters...  We had a reporter, and a Gear duellist, a foot-soldier veteran, and two engineers. These are the PCs (I was the veteran).<br/><br/>The engineers were Howard and Donald; while not related, they never left each other's company, and came to be known in the game as The Duck Brothers (by way of their names).<br/><br/>In the course of the entire campaign, neither of the Duck Brothers took up arms. We had plenty of fights; they never fired a shot. During fights, they took notes on the fights.<br/><br/>And then they tinkered with crafting, with the Gear-construction rules, with all of that. We had the coolest, most wicked gear in the world, custom-built for exactly our actions and skills, and the players of the Duck Brothers had a great time tinkering while we ran around and blew stuff up.<br/><br/>At a marked, basic level, they were not playing <i>the same game</i> that the rest of us were.<br/><br/>And it worked.  With buttery ease.<br/><br/>I've had many, many similar experiences since.<br/><br/>You?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214917/#Comment_214917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T15:43:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  3:43PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't seem to me that you were playing the same game, it sounds like you were playing with different mechanics (Which is present in varying degrees in most roleplaying games, this game would represent an extreme example)<br/><br/>It seems like the point of the game you were playing was "The PCs who are not the Duck Brothers have awesome fights."

Like one sub-systems uses 3D6s, Task Oriented, and the other uses 1d20, Conflict oriented, and when one side has to sit on their arse while the other plays (Deckers?). But that's obviously about group preferences.<br/><br/>I think aside from group and player preferences, it helps that their characters were invested in your fights, taking the notes, and the result of their mechanical tinkering (in both ways) fed into what your characters had done. And that they probably played with the Silhouette's system when you guys weren't together?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214938/#Comment_214938" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T17:06:47+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  5:06PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I think the comments above me are partially about the fact that the word "Game" has two distinct meanings here: Of course they all played in the same social activity we call game.</blockquote>\nNo, no, I was not talking about that.  I was talking about the difference between what <b>PLAYERS</b> do and what <b>CHARACTERS</b> do.<br/><br/>Levi's tale is all about the difference between what the characters did. Taken by itself, this mean nothing. In my last Trollbabe game, one trollbabe was evoking a city of undead, while the other was on the other side of the planet saving a farming community from bandits. Did the players play different games? Of course not. <br/><br/>Even in games where the characters act together, there is the thinker of the group, who never fight, and the bruiser.  Think about Buffy the Vampire Slayer: you would say that Giles's player would play a different game than Buffy's?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214939/#Comment_214939" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T17:08:37+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  5:08PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an even better example: in a Soccer team, the goalkeeper and the left wing play in different sports?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214952/#Comment_214952" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T20:02:19+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  8:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I have an even better example: in a Soccer team, the goalkeeper and the left wing play in different sports?</blockquote>\nLet me rephrase your analogy.<br/><br/>Are the coach and the center playing the same game?

It makes me think about, yes, Deckers from <i>Shadowrun</i>, but also Kaylee and Wash from <i>Firefly</i> - they definitely have different things to do, and aren't at all "hybrid" characters just so they can stay in the action at all times.<br/>A cleric's just a weaker fighter with healing powers (etc.), but a pilot in a <i>Firefly</i> game is probably just a pilot, even if he's a damn good one. <br/>It'd be neat to take this route further than <i>D&amp;D</i> does - the party roles aren't just different strengths of fighting skill with something else tacked on; they don't even have a chance of the spotlight in the same scenes as one another.<br/><br/>This reminds me of my desire to make an artisan class for an RPG at some point, ever since I had a player in a game of <i>Exalted</i>, running a Solar, Twilight Caste, who used her craftsperson powers to be a fashion designer <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Totally not good at combat, only good as a talker, and of course made a living (and twisted a few arms) by making very pretty dresses for officers' wives. <br/><br/>I love it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215064/#Comment_215064" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T10:16:29+00:00" title="June 29, 2009 10:16AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This phenomenon is why my <i>Spycraft </i>games keep dying.

Some indie games are all about this: When it's not the characters that are connected, but the players.<br/><br/>So long each player cares enough to listen to the other's story, it works. Some games add stuff for the non-PC players to do, like an ability to affect the scene. For some reason, most of the games where it happens but not with it being GM-full currently escape my mind.<br/><br/>Maybe it was also Sorcerer? A game where the PCs might not meet up, but they are all existing in the same world with thematic connections?

I'd be real careful about putting CA and other theoryspeak to it in that way.  One could, I suspect, just as easily say that the game of the Duck Brothers worked <i>because</i> the group had a unified gamist CA on the long run, as one could say otherwise, if inclined.<br/><br/>This thing happens.  It can be a huge positive; it can also be a big problem.  Some games, chasing a tight focus, make it less likely to happen in either direction.<br/><br/>The big question, I think, is how to encourage it to happen positively, rather than negatively.

Let me amplify: Suppose you have one guy in your group who lives for gameworld maintenance, who really cares that little Sally dotes on her brother Jed, who is a tough thug in public but a softie once he gets home.  Suppose that you have two other guys who really want to do the whole Story Now enchilada \u2014 they're so hot to address premise and achieve literary technique that they sometimes forget to update the facts in the knowledge base.<br/><br/>These guys are playing Dogs, the first as GM and the others playing the actual Dogs, and they're having a blast, scratching their own creative itches and reinforcing each others' contributions to the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
