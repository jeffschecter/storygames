I haven't posted on any forums for almost five years, between sliding into mental illness and the distraction of maintaining a presence on a forum, I had to take a break.<br/><br/>However, development on my game system, <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/" rel="nofollow">Scattershot</a>, hasn't been on hiatus.<br/><br/>Late last year I decided that the 'as a publisher' approach was going to leave me with nothing.  I set aside the idea of self-publishing, even not-for-profit.  Weirdly, it seems I'm not the only one.  A couple of months ago, it seemed like there was a noticeable shift around the indie game scene.  A number of people have much better and more thought out reasons to drop publishing.  I just wanted to bust my creative block.  So listen to them, not me.<br/><br/>After a <a href="http://rpgheretic.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/play-is-the-point/" rel="nofollow">few mentions</a> of the <a href="http://www.i-would-knife-fight-a-man.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=3296" rel="nofollow">flood of bad indie games</a>, the reasons NOT to publish were examined. <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/01/30/getting-out-of-the-status-game/" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Walton</a>, <a href="http://rpgheretic.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/marketing-in-the-land-of-hobbyists/" rel="nofollow">Clinton R Nixon</a> and <a href="http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/327324.html" rel="nofollow">Fred Hicks</a> wrote on how publishing is not the way to make friends and influence people.  Jonathan specifically <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/01/30/getting-out-of-the-status-game/" rel="nofollow">officially gives up the money</a> side of self-publishing.  Then Joshua A C Newman <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/index.php/2008/02/08/maybe-you-want-not-to-publish/" rel="nofollow">shows us</a> what we can avoid doing this.<br/><br/>That said, I wanted to let everyone know that I have begun posting <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/" rel="nofollow">Scattershot presents: Universe 6 - The World of the Modern Fantastic</a> on its own website.

If a concept car, I've put the working engine on display but it's far from in tune.  Everything else are single prototypes, just back from the lab.<br/><br/>The site design is right out of the can.
