Plus the play aids are usually top notch and most people can jump into the game with very little gaming experience. All this helps push us towards the goal of developing focused games that are very easy to play. <br/><br/>We love to play games. The more games we play, the more we learn. And it may seem that people who like collaborative story focused games and people who like competitive games would be separate but I've found this community, including myself, to love both sides of the spectrum. I love Dogs in the Vineyard but I also love BattleLore, Descent, Jungle Speed, Memoir 44, Settlers, San Juan, Citadels, Heroclix, and more. Just like many people who love tabletop RPGs can like MMOs just the same. <br/><br/>That all being said, let's go back to the idea of German boardgame aesthetic to create awesome story games. Additionally, we love social procedures that help make play fun and problem free. D&amp;D 4E has many of these elements. As a community that loves to play many games and have played RPGs for a long time, it's hard not to get excited about 4E. Throw in the fact that it shares many of this community's aesthetics, and you are doubly sold!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147941/#Comment_147941" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T05:12:59+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  5:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, when Clinton suggested the term "story games" as a replacement for roleplaying, he wasn't (in contrast with some other folks), trying to define a new term for a certain kind of narrative or storytelling-based games.

Sure, there are threads on design here as people work through their own game problems, or suggest little game exercises/challenges and the like. I think that the act of design, for a lot of us, is an analogue to people in other communities doing fanfic or fan art. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, the focus here is on <b>playing</b>, with designing or thinking about design a second. Like, a passenger who rides in the back seat. Or tied up in the trunk. (^.^)<br/><br/>It just so happens that a bunch of people are not only enthusiastic about the direction of the design bits in the game, they're finding that it's fun in play, too. And that's all that really matters here. (^.^)<br/><br/>Also, as I mentioned in other threads, there's definitely a Honeymoon effect going on. In 2-3 weeks we won't see nearly as many "OMG Awesome!" threads. By then we'll probably see more actual play "this is something we did in game that was great"/"help me with my game" threads, which will be awesome and a little more univresal.

For this reason Polaris and Grey Ranks are among my favorite games.  You totally don't have to try to "get it" in those games, just play by the rules and the game delivers.  I like that, alot.  Its what I try to achieve in my designs and I want to see more of it.  This is also foundational to my disdain for games that don't bother to write effective rules to deliver a particular play experience but just expect the players to figure it out and make it happen.  I like that sort of activity too...I just don't need someone elses rules for that, I've been playing "let's pretend" since I was three.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when a new edition of D&amp;D; comes out that completely and totally embraces what I consider to be the single most important thing in game design...clear rules, well presented that delivers a particular play experience just by following them...I get WAY excited about it.  Excited for this game, because I know its a game whose design philosophy I can respect...even if after some play I find cracks in it.  And even more importantly for me, excited by the trend that a game with a following the size of D&amp;D; is likely to kick off.  A trend that I very much support and promote.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love RPGs.  I've long thought we need to learn from boardgames (which are way more popular than RPGs), and learn from computer games (which are way more popular than boardgames) and incorporate some of the elements that make those games successful into our RPG designs.  Things like clear rules, well presented rules, options that allow players to be continually making interesting choices, a focus on the highlights and willingness to abstract, gloss, or even fast forward past the "boring bits".  Its what I've wanted to see in game design for years, its what's attracted me to indie games, its what's got me roleplaying again after nearly abandoning the activity in favor of eurogaming...and I'm really glad to see the philosophy adopted by the biggest rpg company on the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, 4E is something to celebrate.  Yay, the most popular game on the planet has just issued an edition that at the very least is heading towards the design philosophy I like best!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147981/#Comment_147981" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T07:02:17+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  7:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Also, remember IAWA + Red Box Hack month?

I'm only talking straight (into trouble, it seems) on a theme that baffles me. I do see that a lot of people have a lot of fun with D&amp;D, even though I believe they would have <i>a lot more fun</i> with other RPGs. But each player (or GM) is free to choose, of course. I can do naught about it, but to raise my voice and give them my point of view. <br><br>Valamir: wow man! I respect you bigtime for this answer! Cool and steady, and clearly founded in your own design-philosophy. Your philosophy looks very much like mine. Still: I'm not overexcited about this game. It is so far from what I normally expect from a roleplaying game, and even if I like the occational monster-bashing, I've found my own classical FRP-game to be better than anything ever given to me in a session of D&amp;D. And all other classical RPGs I've tried, from Call of C to Warhammer to Paranoia and James Bond, have delivered more. I even played D&amp;D to the finals of the national championship twice, only to experience sub-standard scenarios run by pathetic GMs, in a way that made the ultimate best of Norwegian roleplayers seem like a herd of dumb sheep. That told me the game is (has been) fatally flawed, and probably very detrimental to the hobby as a whole. That is my personal sentiment, of course, not at all something I would claim to be an universal truth. I reckon a lot of people would have tons of reasons to disagree with me, and maybe this edition has rendered my point of view a bit less valid.<br><br>I am glad that the game, as it is played by a lot of people, have raised their own standard, but I still se no reason to flock around it shouting HUZZA.<br/><br/>It was the "flocking" on this forum I did not understand. It's been thoroughly explained to me now, bot in direct and indirect ways.

I can respect that bad experiences with the culture around a game system can make you want to steer away from it -- I tried to play Amber Diceless once -- so I won't fight you on this one, but I do disagree.<br/><br/>Those old boring con games you've described? You'd have to bend or break the rules pretty hard, and ignore most of the advice in the DMG and MM as well, to even run a game like those under 4th. It's a coherent design and the collective weight of all those preexisting attitudes about how D&amp;D is "supposed to play" doesn't really hold it back.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the system has issues, but to me it feels like they put more effort into removing the suck than they did in keeping it "faithful" to old editions. Reading it, I got as much of a "These guys have their design down" impression from reading it as I did from Agon or FATE (two of my faves), which means I'm far, far more impressed with the design than I expected. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, it seems that lots of "traditional D&amp;D" fans seem upset that so much incoherence was stripped out of the game design, because it does what it intends to do and no more.  For example, there's tons of things that are not explained in "in fiction" terms -- they give you the game mechanics and some evocative flavor text, and what actually happens in the shared imagined space is up to the people at the table. A fair number of people absolute hate that about it, but it's not a flaw in the design, it's intended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148370/#Comment_148370" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T09:43:38+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  9:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah Tomas, if it helps...don't call it or think of it as D&amp;D; at all.
