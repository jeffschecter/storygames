But also a little bit of B, where the problem of the ambitions and goals is at least in part, A.  Mostly it is A.  The advice to GMs in the Dresden book makes this pretty clear.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I maintain this is because Aspects are TERRIBLE for generating situation.

In fact the mechanics of Aspects are such that they only <i>color</i> situations. Let's say you have that Aspect and you're a wizzard. We start the game, I'm the GM, and I toss you a chip for a compel. You were drunk casting a spell on your slytherin or whatever and now there's a monster running around.  Being a drunk is not the situation - but it does personalize the situation to you, tie you into the situation.  The monster running around is the situation.<br/><br/>Similarly, City Creation inevitably creates a bunch of crazy people who all want to kill each other.  Cities in Dresden are glass houses and a pile of rocks.  That's the situation. Which ones take which action against each other is supposed to be tied to the players' Aspects.  If someone is a good-hearted Sorceress and there's a White Council asswipe in town, then that asswipe is going to decide that Sorcerers are a fucking problem and foreclosure fraud is the solution (or whatever).  The situation is the asswipe's evil plan.  The player's Aspects tie them to the situation and color the situation according to their character traits.<br/><br/>You could conceivably run a Dresden game in which the characters are self-starters who want to come out on top, and make the game much more about B than A, and I am pretty sure that this is listed in a sidebar or subsection as a possibility, but no, the game is mostly A.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318632/#Comment_318632" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T22:50:19+00:00" title="April  3, 2011 10:50PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>As I said BOTH of the FATE games we've played have been a little wonky because of this confused tension.</blockquote>\nI don't agree with this at all. I think the tension between dealing with the crisis and achieving your character's agenda is great. It was only presenting a problem for us because some players thought the others would get upset if they neglected the crisis. It was a matter of communication between the players. That's why we started echoing the "talk to you players" advice. When we played Diaspora the problem was we talked about being explorers, rediscovering lost technology, and dealing with the hazards involved with that. Then we completely ignored that set up and decided to bury ourselves in the affairs of the primitive society on the first planet you went to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318701/#Comment_318701" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T11:42:00+00:00" title="April  4, 2011 11:42AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2011 11:42AM by Jesse.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>It's A.

I've seen it happen in many systems. We plan to do one thing, then we get into another, and we think we are being signaled by everyone else that something is important to them and we go along even though it's not important to us or related to our plans and before we know it we've successfully buried the game.  Sometimes this ends up being okay in the end, other times everyone is disappointed. <br/><br/>If I misread a player and think they're interested in something when they're not, and I give them more of that thing, they might misread me and think I'm interested in that something when I'm not. It can really happen in any system, since the communication of those interests is a social level thing (though maybe not exclusively, see Keys and Flags and so on).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318724/#Comment_318724" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T13:49:49+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  1:49PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the Dresden Files scenario-generation process:<br/><br/><br/>1. Assemble Aspects<br/>2. Choose Emphasis<br/>3. Make Connections<br/>4. Scenario Ideas<br/>5. Putting It All Together<br/>6. Scene Hooks<br/>7. Create Additional NPCs<br/><br/><br/>And, briefly, the steps:<br/><br/>1. Assemble Aspects:  Make a list of all of the PCs\u2019 aspects, your city\u2019s themes and threats, location aspects (both themes and threats), and the motivations of faces and other key NPCs.  (NOTE:  in Dresden Files, all the players contribute to creating the city, the locations, and the NPCs.)<br/><br/>2. Choose Emphasis:  Choose which of these aspects you\u2019d like to emphasize for this scenario. [...] To generate a shorter scenario, pick just two or three from among the PCs\u2019 aspects and one or two from the city. For really long scenarios, stretching over several game sessions, pick up to two for each PC and two or three from the city.<br/><br/>3. Make Connections:  Take aspects related to different PCs, or a PC and an NPC, and start pairing them up. Look for strong connections that leap out at you.<br/><br/>[and so forth; that's probably enough to get my point across.]<br/><br/><br/>My point here is that, if you follow the DF System as written, you're building the scenario out of PC Aspects.  The plot of the scenario is driven by the characters' agendas.

The potential for tension is obvious -- Harry is supposed to act in the interest of the White Council at all times, but his own brother is a Prince of the White Court.  Given the war, that\u2019s a pretty big potential conflict of interest.<br/><br/>Other examples of Aspect pairs that create tension might be Fix\u2019s "Geased by Titania" and Harry\u2019s "Faerie Debts". Harry\u2019s "Warden of the White Council" and Murphy\u2019s "SI Lead Detective" frequently put them at odds on how to deal with supernatural crimes in Chicago.<br/><br/>Harry provides yet another great example here. His Aspect "Wizard Private Eye" and Murphy\u2019s "SI Lead Detective" put them at the same crime scene, working together to try to figure out how -- and why -- Jennifer Stanton died.<br/><br/><br/>Based on that excerpt, it seems to me that the authors of DF are of the opinion that Aspects do (or can, or should) say quite a bit about a character's goals.  I mean, sure, it's possible that you drop "Wizard Private Eye" and "SI Lead Detective" into a crime scene and they decide, ennhh screw solving the crime, let's go out and get mojitos.  But it doesn't seem immediately problematic to operate on the default premise that the reason the players are playing characters with those Aspects is because they want characters with goals like investigating crime scenes and catching bad guys.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm starting to feel bad now about not giving the podcast a listen yet, so I'll try to check it out tonight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318740/#Comment_318740" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T15:03:58+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  3:03PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the confusion is over the word "agenda" vs. "goals". Certainly I can identify your character's normal agenda from your Aspects.

That's a good start!  So step 1 is Assemble Aspects.  I'm happy to just make some up as I go along; if you want to provide some real ones, though, that's groovy too.<br/><br/>So I'm imagining some city Aspects like "Every man has his price" and/or "Crooked as a dog's hind leg".  A good Face (NPC) for that sort of thing might be Harvey Dent, District Attorney, with an aspect like "Justice to the highest bidder."<br/><br/>2: Choose Emphasis:  I'm thinking "Wizard Money Man" up against "Crooked as a dog's hind leg".  This'll be a scenario about a wizard trying to make a buck in a corrupt town.  Good times.<br/><br/>3:  Make Connections:  I think the tension here is going to be between "Wizard Money Man" and "Justice to the highest bidder."  There's some co-operation too, between "At war with my business partners" and "Justice to the highest bidder."<br/><br/>4:  Create Scenario Ideas:  My main idea here is that the business partners pay off Harvey Dent to bring a spurious investigation against our wizard.  I think the specific details are, in fact, there inside the Aspects.  As an outsider, I don't know if "Wizard Money Man" is a guy who is selling winning lottery numbers to the highest bidder, or predicting the stock market, or what; as someone who went through the entire collaborative character creation process around the table, though, I'd probably have a pretty good idea.<br/><br/>So, what's his goal, in this scenario?  I feel pretty confident that his goal is going to be to avoid being convicted and sent to prison.  I could be wrong, sure.<br/><br/>Of course, this doesn't tell us anything about what our wizard will specifically do; we don't know yet if he's going to try to bribe Harvey with even more money, or cut off his head in a dark alley, or get all lawyered up.  That's good!<br/><br/>So... I'm not sure if this addresses your issues or not.  I feel like we're walking down the righteous path together, but I could be mistaken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318767/#Comment_318767" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T17:37:40+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  5:37PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I think the confusion is over the word "agenda" vs. "goals".

However, the characters will <i>also</i> have goals completely unrelated to the "monster of the week." There are no built in tools to help the GM here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318773/#Comment_318773" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T18:47:16+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  6:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I feel compelled to ask:  Did Harry Dresden have goals completely unrelated to the monster of the week?

So, sorry about that.  Everything's become clearer.<br/><br/>So... yeah.  The good news is that I think I understand what you're getting at now.<br/><br/>And I think it's directly related to Trouble troubles.  I read Trouble as very similar to PtA's Issue, although that might just be my personal quirk.<br/><br/>I think it is possible to resolve a character's Trouble -- I think both Harry and maybe Murphy do this by the end of the last book -- but here's the thing:  You also change the High Concept when you do this.  That's how the Trouble is resolved.<br/><br/>In terms of character goals that take less than a twelve-book series to resolve, yeah, I believe you: this isn't really something that DF does out of the box, in say the same way BW provides.  You could probably graft in something like Plot Stress Track from, hmmm, StarBlazer? if you wanted to try to do something like this.<br/><br/>For something more lightweight, consider this idea:  Express shorter-term goals as Consequence Aspects.  This time... it's personal.<br/><br/>The DF books aren't strictly episodic, but they're pretty glacial in terms of character change, by an rpg scale.  I mean, yeah, Harry gets a new job on Council.  But he sure takes his sweet time getting there.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, sorry again for leaping before I listened.

But by the same token, those tools only work if the players are playing in that sandbox. If the player decides to go somewhere else, either the GM can make it still about the City and use the stuff the group made, or they've got to make new stuff.<br/><br/>Our game has been having similar issues as yours with regard to aspects. We play a lot of Burning Wheel (and SotC), so we approached Dresden like SotC, but with Beliefs in the form of Aspects. The trouble is that Aspects don't direct play that way, precisely as Will points out. There's no goal. Aspects are very abstract and they're fun for color, but they only sometimes function like Sorcerer's Kickers or Burning Wheel's Beliefs. We're fixing things by discussing the issue amongst ourselves, deciding on agendas and going for them. The GM also has had to grab the NPCs he had at his disposal, give them clear agendas that are in opposition to our goals (not just highlighting an aspect).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
