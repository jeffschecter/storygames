So I got started and translated my newest game "Medan v\xe4rlden g\xe5r under" into English.<br/><br/>Now... it is almost fifteen years since I last had English in school.  It might be pretty horrible without me realizing it.<br/><br/>Does anyone want to take a look at the game before I put it up on Lulu? It's a pretty small game 40 pages / 7000 words. And it is about space, the future, human drama and stuff.  It is complete with pictures and all.  If you have three friends, four hours and some D6s you could even give it a spin this very weekend.<br/><br/>Sorry, no money in return for the effort.  But you'll get listed in the credits if you point something out that leads to a change.<br/><br/>Let me know below. Whisper me an email-address if you don't have one in your profile.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238032/#Comment_238032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T01:13:51+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  1:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have found some proofreaders now.
