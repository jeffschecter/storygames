Specifically with the caveat YMMV - some gamers who experience / enjoy immersion may find that some of the things suggested in the list are actually counter-immersive for them. And obviously, in compiling the list, there is a risk that my own bias has crept in, as it nearly exactly reflects my own preferences. The only major difference I have to the majority is that my tolerance of "clunkiness" is far higher than most people's.<br/><br/>What do people think of my list?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391549/#Comment_391549" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T08:01:13+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  8:01AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS I use my definition of immersion throughout, which is stated in the OP on TBP.

There are people who find the concept nof sitting around a table being totally immerse in character is laughable, because how can you be totally immersed without striving for a 360 degree illusion. And the other end of the spectrum there are people that cant imagine how they can be immersed if they still have to use thier own body in any sense in reach character immersion trough text role-playing best.<br/><br/>Immersion is a state.

People hear it and use it to mean things that are different and often at odds. I find that it does little to aid discussion.<br/><br/>Especially when you talk about "breaking immersion" and "immersion in character" at the same time. In my mind, that means you are talking about 2 different things.<br/><br/>I wrote an article where I delineated 16 player motives, of which about 3-4 include various elements that people often mean when they are talking about immersion, though they mix them up and don't always mean the same ones.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14484/article-on-player-motives/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14484/article-on-player-motives/p1</a><br/><br/>Using that terminology, "immersion in character" most commonly is a reference to Embodiment - the desire to make decisions based on character knowledge/understanding/motivation/etc.<br/><br/>The need to make strategic decisions based on mechanics that feel heavily disassociated from what the character would be knowing and feeling can be seen as a challenge to the desire for Embodiment opportunities.<br/><br/>But when you are talking about "breaking immersion", you are almost always starting to talk about not being able to achieve Flow (or being pulled out of it, once you've started to), which is a different, if related, thing. You can achieve flow through Embodiment - the act of making those character-based decisions can be the challenge that makes Flow happen. But you can achieve Flow with other things, like making strategic battlemap decisions that are a combination of spacial and tactical and have little to do with your character's feelings and knowledge.<br/><br/>The survey response about being railroaded and losing ownership is, more than anything, about frustrating the Protagonist motive, which is again different.<br/><br/>I think deconstructing the "immersion in character" concept into it's component parts (as well as looking at other common motives), the way I did in my article would lead to a much more fruitful discussion than your tangled web of related meanings.<br/><br/>When I look at your survey, I see it more as a survey about which of my 16 motives a player tends to value. Except with only half of them present and not looked at from the right perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391572/#Comment_391572" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T10:57:23+00:00" title="September 27, 2012 10:57AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also read the article "Role-Playing Communities, Cultures of Play and the Discourse of Immersion" by <a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">@Jiituomas</a>, and <a href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">@Emily_Care</a> in <a href="http://mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6834-8" rel="nofollow">our book</a> which articulates the precise problem here as intrinsic to differentiated gaming cultures.<br/><br/>Notable excerpts:<br/><br/>"Because immersion is central to many participants\u2019 understanding of their own experience in these activities, it can serve as a foundational problematic for the study of that experience as a cultural form and enable connections to be made across fields of study and types of play.

What their common experience is is relevant, IMHO, to game design, GMing and playing where immersion is a goal of play. Simply because, if it works for the majority, you can design a game to cater for the majority of people; you can GM a game to cater for people whose immersive styles you don't fully understand yet; you can get new ideas to try out stuff to help your own immersion and that of your fellow players. I never stated it would work for everyone. But I think it works for enough people to be significant and worth trying. A poll can bear that out.\n<blockquote>I find the term immersion to be overloaded to the point of uselessness.</blockquote>\nI disagree. It has enough of a meaning for enough people to recognise it, and when I talk about "breaking immersion" in the context of "immersion in character", obviously I mean "disrupting/ending immersion in character". It's the same kind of immersion I'm talking about.\n<blockquote><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14484/article-on-player-motives/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14484/article-on-player-motives/p1</a></blockquote>\nThat's a massive essay. I'll read it some time. I'm afraid I don't have time to right now.<br/><br/>Using your terminology, I think so far (just based on what you've posted) that you're assuming that the Flow you get from Embodiment is the same kind of Flow you get from other things. And I basically disagree. I think the experience of immersion in character, as a psychological state, is sufficiently distinct from other kinds of deep absorption in various subject-matter to be considered separately. Cf. hypnotic trance, for instance, though it needn't be "deep".<br/><br/>I prefer not to second-guess the voters in the poll too much, and take what they say (in large numbers at any rate) more or less at face value. The poll asked reasonably precise questions. My impression is that most people answered it in a valid way, i.e. in a way which gave a reasonable version of their accurate personal answer to the question posed.\n<blockquote>Also read the article "Role-Playing Communities, Cultures of Play and the Discourse of Immersion" by <a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">@Jiituomas</a>, and <a href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">@Emily_Care</a> in <a href="http://mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6834-8" rel="nofollow">our book</a> which articulates the precise problem here as intrinsic to differentiated gaming cultures.<br/><br/>Notable excerpts:<br/><br/>"Because immersion is central to many participants\u2019 understanding of their own experience in these activities, it can serve as a foundational problematic for the study of that experience as a cultural form and enable connections to be made across fields of study and types of play.

I've given my definition of it in the 2nd post on this thread, and in the OP on The Big Purple, and the poll question and thread title on TBP highlight the meaning I intend. I don't find any interest in a lengthy debate as to the meaning of the term. My poll was set up to ask questions about immersion in character, and I thought people might be interested in the conclusions to be tentatively drawn from my poll, hence this thread. The poll has nothing to do, directly at least, with [edited] any other phenomenon [other than immersion in character] which might be called immersion by some gamers.<br/><br/>I have, however, been considering buying your book, although I can see we have quite different approaches to the subject-matter.

And it's a Flow unlike other kinds of Flow, which deserves its own name. I call it immersion, alternatively immersion in character.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rob">@Rob</a> &amp; <a href="/forums/profile/Evan">@Evan</a>, I use the term immersion exclusively to refer to a psychological phenomenon, and not simply to the externally observable process of "Actor Stance" or "Character Stance". I don't see the slightest reason to use immersion to refer to an externally observable mode of behaviour as opposed to a psychological state. Externally observable behaviour isn't what's driven the immersionist debate IMHO. What's driven the discourse is that people see this as a goal of play. They don't see it as a goal of play because of its value as, say, "art" or because of how it looks aesthetically on the outside. They see it as a goal of play because they enjoy it, internally, as an aspect of how they feel during the game. I think people who've used the term to describe the thing I understand by "Actor Stance" (i.e. restricting yourself to in-character motivations and reasoning in how you portray your character) have missed the fundamental point, frankly. I wish I could get that point across in a less controversial-sounding way. It's just that... restricting yourself to in-character motivations and reasoning doesn't need its own word, per se, and if it does, "Actor Stance" is, I suppose, passable. What really needs its own term is the distinct psychological phenomenon of feeling at least somewhat as if you are your character, feeling like your character, that sort of thing. It needs that term as much for advertising a gaming session or advertising a rule-set of a game as it does for anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391579/#Comment_391579" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T12:50:25+00:00" title="September 27, 2012 12:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>PS <a href="/forums/profile/Rob">@Rob</a>, I think in your terms, what I'm contending for is a distinct kind of Flow which is associated factually with Embodiment, but it is the Flow which is the interesting bit, not the Embodiment. </blockquote>\nI agree that that is what you are talking about.\n<blockquote>And it's a Flow unlike other kinds of Flow, which deserves its own name.

Because people see that term and they think about other stuff.<br/><br/>They think about connecting with their character's emotions and feeling those emotions, which I call out separately as the Catharsis motive (not a perfect name, since it doesn't quite line up 100% with the clinical definition of catharsis, but it's close and I haven't found a word that's closer and isn't confusing in other ways).<br/><br/>They think about making their character important in the world and having agency, which I call out separately as the Protagonist motive (and which appears in your survey in the railroading option).<br/><br/>They think about exploring the setting through their character, which I call out separately as Exploration.  You try to say that that's what you mean in your OP, but it still comes up in people's responses.<br/><br/>They think about being surrounded by the 360 degree illusion, as w176 mentioned in her post and which is mentioned in the purple thread repeatedly when people talk about larp, which in my terms is a combination of Exploration and Exhibition and Crafting, depending on which parts of the illusion creation you're focused on (I larp a lot, so I get pretty granular on those parts).<br/><br/>Try as you might, when you use the term immersion, you get confused connotations and people talking across each other.<br/><br/>I read most of your purple thread, which ended up mostly being a place for you to argue with people about what you mean and what you like, rather than as a place to gather data to inform design. You needed to do a lot of work to extract usable conclusions out of the discussion/arguments/venting that happened.<br/><br/>The questions you ask and the results you draw seem more focused on "how to not design a crappy game or have a crappy tabletop experience" rather than on "how to encourage immersion through design".<br/><br/>Especially when you focus on "what breaks immersion". That question encourages venting, which is less constructive. And on the internet, no encouragement is needed for venting to happen.<br/><br/>I think a much better question is "what elements of game design encourage flow".<br/><br/>Asking that question is likely to get more useable answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391583/#Comment_391583" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T13:37:06+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  1:37PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2012 1:37PM by w176.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the gaming context I move in the term immersion is about immersion is about emotional immersion. To feel the feelings the character feel. To think what the character is thinking. To immerse in the characters emotional life. (Or if you going to immerse on a story level immerse into the emotion of the story as whole, not just the individual characters.) <br/><br/>Immersion has in itself nothing to do with exploring the world, not about making choices, not making my character important, not exploring the world and or setting.  Immersion is simply sharing the characters emotions. Exploring, making decisions, etc. Those are things that you might be doing while feeling a strong emotional immersion, they might be topics you want to have feelings about, they might even be tools to reach the immersion.<br/><br/>But they are not immersion in themself.<br/><br/>They are agendas.<br/><br/>Immersion is a state.

It is a single-minded immersion and represents perhaps the ultimate in harnessing the emotions in the service of performing and learning. In flow, the emotions are not just contained and channeled, but positive, energized, and aligned with the task at hand. To be caught in the ennui of depression or the agitation of anxiety is to be barred from flow. The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task[2] although flow is also described (below) as a deep focus on nothing but the activity \u2013 not even oneself or one's emotions."</blockquote>\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_</a>(psychology)<br/><br/>If you character feel miserable, immersion is when you feel that misery. If you character is in pain, then immersion is feeling that pain. If you character is bored and frustrated, immersion is feeling that boredom and frustration. If you character is emotionally exhausted, immersion is when you also feel emotionally exhausted.  Not when you enter a joyous energized flow state.<br/><br/>As you can see, immersion is about sharing feelings with the character. Flow is most often not combine-able and even counter productive to reaching a state of immersion. (Unless both the character and you enter a flow state at the same time.)<br/><br/>Flow= An psychological state in it own right.<br/><br/>Immersion= Sharing the characters psychological state.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391584/#Comment_391584" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T13:52:31+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  1:52PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The term Bleed works for that, and leads to less confusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391586/#Comment_391586" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T14:14:19+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  2:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No. For me, it not the same but connected. <br/><br/>Immersion is the feeling of the moment.

It's a free-to-download PDF from Lulu, so your only excuse for not reading it now I've given you the link is that it's about 50 pages long (and that's a pretty good excuse). You might be able to download it more directly <a href="https://www.lulu.com/items/volume_70/10899000/10899695/3/print/10899695.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, depending on how the inner cogs of Lulu work. It's been a while since I wrote it and some of my ideas may have changed considerably in the interim.<br/> <br/>Let me restate my definition of immersion:- feeling somewhat that you are your character, feeling like your character, feeling as if your character is an extension of yourself (or vice versa), a sense of identity with your character, [usually vividly] imagining being your character, seeing/feeling things as your character does. These are all part and parcel of the same phenomenon [they all go together for me and I think for a lot of people - even if "feeling as if you are your character" is the deeper level of the immersive state and not always attained as readily] and it's difficult to find a precise expression for this distinct feeling. The only two I can think of are "immersion" (including "immersion in character") and "getting into character", although the latter conflates immersion in character with "Actor Stance" / "Character Stance" (which are about what you're doing, rather than how you feel). Edited to add:- to me this is almost the same thing as w176's definition of sharing the character's psychological state, which more or less covers it.<br/><br/>There is a concept of Dual Consciousness / Double Consciousness (from Stanislavsky and other acting and drama theorists) where you are simultaneously both in-character in this sense (in your psychological state) and also aware of the needs of the stage at the same time. It can be basically the same for roleplayers.\n<blockquote><br/>... people see that term and they think about other stuff.</blockquote>\nLet's explore that assertion.\n<blockquote>They think about connecting with their character's emotions and feeling those emotions, </blockquote>\nThat's so close to what I'm talking about that it's almost the same thing. I would say - it's an aspect of what I'm talking about, though not the whole of it. If you're immersed in the sense I describe, you'll probably be feeling your characters emotions, or rather, you'll feel distinct emotions that your character would be feeling, because your character would be feeling them, or something similar. That may only be from time to time though, as your character won't always have strong emotions for you to feel.<br/><br/>It's a form of heightened empathy with your character which naturally flows from your sense of identity with them in the sense of feeling almost as if you are them and seeing the world through their eyes.<br/><br/>[cont.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391594/#Comment_391594" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T14:23:00+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  2:23PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2012 2:36PM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [apologies if I'm thread-hogging]\n<blockquote>They think about making their character important in the world and having agency, which I call out separately as the Protagonist motive (and which appears in your survey in the railroading option).</blockquote>\nFunnily enough, I long ago reached the view [see my Lulu essay] that railroading breaks immersion because it deprives people of a sense of ownership of their characters. It's the same phenomenon of immersion in character that I'm talking about which railroading breaks. This one unified sensation of feeling almost as if you are your character or feeling somewhat like your character (or somewhere in between those two ends of the continuum) can be broken by numerous different things. That doesn't mean that it's a number of different and separate, psychologically unassociated phenomena conmingled. The proof of this is in the fact that once immersion in character has been broken for someone for one of the reasons listed, the other things that can break immersion become almost irrelevant, save as further barriers to re-attaining the state of immersion. This is true for me at least, and it's consistent with all the conversations about immersion I've ever had, though I don't think that the specific point has come up explicitly in them.<br/><br/>What I infer is that you've noticed that people complain about their immersion being destroyed by railroading and you've inferred that when they talk about immersion some of them are in fact talking about their sense of ownership of their character, which you call protagonism. But in my view you're fundamentally mistaken because they're actually by and large in fact (IME) talking about immersion in character in more or less exactly the sense I describe. What they're getting at is that a sense of ownership is a building block for immersion in character in the sense I describe, or more precisely, and more accurately, that the stark awareness of a lack of a sense of ownership of one's character (or a sense of agency), which they experience when railroaded, is, for them, a barrier to attaining/maintaining immersion in character in the sense in which I use that term. <br/><br/>Let me break it down for you. You get the sense of immersion in character (in the sense in which I use that term) by feeling somewhat as if you are your character, feeling a sense of oneness with your character, that sort of thing. You can't [and this is not a universal thing, but true for most people, subjectively] feel as if you ARE your character if you don't feel that you're in fact making any [significant] decisions for your character. Why? Because it's by being the one in control of your character that you [not universally, but generally in many cases] start to feel the greatest sense of identity with him. By the act of making decisions for your character in the way your character would, just as by talking as your character, you are "being" your character in a concrete way. That produces the feeling of "being" your character. The one begets the other. Scupper the one, and you scupper the other. The cause is in-character roleplay with agency. The effect is a psychological sensation. But the cause is not the same as the effect. The cause and the effect are separate things. \n<blockquote>They think about exploring the setting through their character, which I call out separately as Exploration.  You try to say that that's what you mean in your OP, but it still comes up in people's responses.</blockquote>\nObviously if you're immersed in character in the sense I describe, it follows that when you explore the setting you will be doing so through your character's eyes. [Subject to the rider that there is this thing called dual consciousness which Stanislavsky describes - you could be exploring the setting through both your own eyes and your character's eyes at once.] But that's not the essence of immersion in character, which is simply feeling somewhat that you are your character, feeling like your character, etc. as per the above. It's just incidental to that that if you are immersed in the sense I describe, you will also be, out of necessity, exploring the setting through/as your character, whenever you're exploring the setting at all.<br/><br/>When people try to articulate their idea of immersion and talk about exploring the setting as/through their character, they are (almost certainly, in almost every case) trying to articulate the same idea that I'm trying to articulate, of being immersed in their character's perspective, mindset and feelings (the most innate aspect of what their character is - his mind).<br/><br/>[cont.]<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391595/#Comment_391595" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T14:24:06+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  2:24PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2012 2:43PM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [repeated apologies for thread-hogging]\n<blockquote>They think about being surrounded by the 360 degree illusion, as w176 mentioned in her post and which is mentioned in the purple thread repeatedly when people talk about larp, which in my terms is a combination of Exploration and Exhibition and Crafting, depending on which parts of the illusion creation you're focused on (I larp a lot, so I get pretty granular on those parts).</blockquote>\nBeing surrounded by a 360 degree illusion is simply {part of} what leads to the feeling of immersion, alternatively another way of expressing the same thing.<br/><br/>Edited to add:- I LARP tons too, and have had considerably more experience of immersion LARPing than tabletopping.\n<blockquote>Try as you might, when you use the term immersion, you get confused connotations and people talking across each other.</blockquote>\nI fundamentally disagree. If I heard a hundred roleplayers defining the term immersion in varying combinations of one or more of the things you've outlined above, I would still conclude that probably 95% of them are talking about basically the same thing. It's just very hard to articulate what exactly it is because there's no exact word for it in standard English.\n<blockquote>I read most of your purple thread, which ended up mostly being a place for you to argue with people about what you mean and what you like, rather than as a place to gather data to inform design. You needed to do a lot of work to extract usable conclusions out of the discussion/arguments/venting that happened.<br/><br/>The questions you ask and the results you draw seem more focused on "how to not design a crappy game or have a crappy tabletop experience" rather than on "how to encourage immersion through design".<br/></blockquote>\nBearing in mind that the purple thread is an informal discussion, not an academic critique, I think that's not an accurate representation of it. Though, you've read it more recently than I have, especially in the broader context of your post, so I don't state that without reservation. Insofar as people have argued about the meaning of terms on that thread it's been mainly things like dissociated mechanics. Only one poster, TheBigDice, IIRC took issue with my use of the term immersion - this problem having been otherwise forestalled by careful phrasing of the poll, thread title and OP, inasmuch as it referred to immersion in character.<br/><br/>Edited to add:- I expressly disavow any intention to make a list of "what makes a better game" in broad, general terms. It is a list focused laser-like on immersion in character. Please don't mistake it for anything else.\n<blockquote>Especially when you focus on "what breaks immersion". That question encourages venting, which is less constructive. </blockquote>\nI disagree. It's been very informative to see what people vent about in that particular context. It's also very informative to know what people vent about more generally, so you can consider whether to avoid it in game design. Though, that's not what the Big Purple thread was about, on a fair reading.\n<blockquote>I think a much better question is "what elements of game design encourage flow".<br/><br/>Asking that question is likely to get more useable answers.</blockquote>\nI think, seriously, that that would prompt nothing but absolute bafflement and perhaps facetious remarks about the menstrual cycle. Apologies, I seem to have just made one of those, but you've got to admit it's mildly amusing. I have never come across the term "flow" <i>in isolation</i> meaning "flow of play" or anything of relevance to RPG design. If I asked the Big Purple public "what elements of game design encourage 'flow of play'" I would get answers to the question "what elements of game design keep the game flowing i.e. prevent it from becoming interrupted and broken up". I certainly wouldn't get the answer to the question "what elements of game design help you to stay psychologically in-character in your mind", which perhaps would be a fair way of phrasing the question I was asking, but, IME, IMHO, YMMV, a less immediate way of posing the question and perhaps less meaningful to most voters.<br/><br/>[OK folks, sorry but I think it's better I leave my contributions to the thread there for the moment - I'll come back to it later if I may when others have had a chance to get a word in edgeways]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391605/#Comment_391605" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T18:39:24+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  6:39PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have a look at page 97 (actually 114) in <a href="http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/" rel="nofollow">Beyond Role and Play</a>.

You seem to have done this the right way, generally, and thus you have come up with a list that says a lot about how people regard their ability to reach an immersive state in their game-play.<br/><br/>Here's my comments on the points in your list:\n<blockquote>* avoid dissociated mechanics, "author stance" and anything which regularly requires out-of-character thought processes to decide how your character acts or what happens in the game</blockquote>There is a threshold, yes, so a game demanding a lot of OOC-actions/thought processes/stance will make players drop out of the immersive stance. We do drop in and out of it anyway, but dropping out too much makes it harder to obtain and maintain.\n<blockquote>* keep things believable - retain suspension of disbelief</blockquote>"Believable" is a term that has to be clarified; it varies a lot from game to game, what makes "believable" interaction and description. It is, to a degree, dependent on the internal logics of the genre.\n<blockquote>* don't railroad the players</blockquote>A lot of players have been railroaded by clumsy and insecure GMs, so it is easy to jump to the conclusion that <i>railroading</i> is bad. It is not. The paragraph should rather read like this; "Don't play with clumsy GMs".<br/><br/>Railroading is a technique, and when used right it will help players to focus on certain parts of a fiction. I've used it lots of times, and have had some of my most immersive and emotionally engaging games ever in scenarios based on this technique. \n<blockquote>* make sure players start the game with solid character concepts with easy roleplay fodder</blockquote>A paragraph I would like to nuance a bit; "solid character concepts" is often interpreted as "detailed", and that interpretation often leads to clunky characters that is hard to play. My philosophy is that players seldom know what they are able to play, so let them make simple characters, and help them bring the characters alive when the game starts, in co-play. Doing it that way you ensure that the character grows from their ability, and as a natural part of the fiction (see "Keep things believable").\n<blockquote>* avoid personality mechanics, at any rate dictatorial personality mechanics</blockquote>Be careful with such mechanics; make them work for the player, and make the players work with them. If the mechanics and players don't mix well; ditch the mechanics!<br/><br/>If you get such mechanics to work, they are a great tool for helping players into fields of play they would not normally choose, and thus they may be helped into a believable experience of "the stranger" (a being with substantial differences to yourself).\n<blockquote>* use 1st person direct speech in-character dialogue --- avoid social conflict mechanics, at any rate ones which interrupt the free flow of natural dialogue excessively</blockquote>My experience is that social mechanics needs to be fast-resolving. And they are best used in the start of a scene, to inform the interaction (not in the middle, to break it).\n<blockquote>* cut out background distractions - make sure you turn up to the game smelling fresh, and leave your phone alone</blockquote>Really important! Tidy room. Clear and mood-building character-sheets. Empty, wiped table. As little outside sounds as possible. A closed door. The GM is a focal point, so she needs to be placed against a neutral background, preferably dark (a dark curtain or empty wall is best). Other players are focal points too, so having all sitting in an empty, dark chamber is great.\n<blockquote>* avoid intrusive mechanics, including any mechanics which are "clunkier" than your group is comfortable with</blockquote>It is deceptively easy to build complex interaction with the help of simple tools. For me the ideal state of game-play is one with a certain <i>drive</i> to it, and reaching and maintaining such a drive is best done with fast, efficient methods. As a subordinate part of the method, the mechanics need to work with speed. <b>Keep it simple! Roll fast! Keep the role alive!</b><br/><br/>Some game-designers may take quantum leaps in their understanding of this media, if they realize that die-rolling and number-chrunching is, in fact, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the primary goal of role-playing games; the primary goal is <i>role-playing</i>. <br/><br/>Have a nice day!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391614/#Comment_391614" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T01:20:08+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  1:20AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2012 1:53AM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think for my "layman's terms" for immersion [in character], I'm still going with "not just pretending to be an elf, but feeling somewhat as if you are an elf, or feeling somewhat like an elf".<br/><br/>In terms of a more pretentious version of the same definition, how about:- a feeling, sense or experience of a degree of psychological unity with your character, or of a psychlogical connection with your character less immediate than psychological unity but of a similar basic nature.<br/><br/>The layman's version and the pretentious version really are the same thing just differently expressed.\n<blockquote>"immersion", like "unplayable" and the "-punk" suffix is a perfectly good word ruined by gamers. Take it out behind the shed and bury it for a generation or two. It might regain some usefulness by then.</blockquote>\nI radically disagree. Playing immersively in the sense I use that phrase is a distinct playstyle. Not only that, but unlike a broader use of the term immersion to encompass e.g. immersion in the "story" or the "world" or the "experience of play as a whole", immersion [in character] gives rise to an identifiable distinctive commonality of experience across a decent proportion of gamers who game that way (not all, I accept, but many). The point is that that commonality of experience can be isolated and identified by encouraging gamers to identify how immersion [in character] works for them and by analysing what they say, understanding it with a degree of empathy, introspection and psychological insight and taking what people say at face value to the extent that your analysis permits. My poll does a pretty poor job of identifying that commonality of experience, as I've missed out some things which emerged repeatedly in the thread (e.g. personality mechanics), but it's a start and definitely better than nothing.<br/><br/>You can identify this "commonality of experience" for a very decent proportion of gamers who immerse in character. Certainly not all. Some are "anomalous" I suppose.<br/><br/>You can't identify this "commonality of experience" for any other kind of "immersion" broad enough to be worthy of separate discussion in a game-design or game-PR context. Sure, if you split immersion in character (IMHO artificially) into many subtly different aspects of the same thing (which is the effect, IMHO, YMMV, of Rob's analysis in some respects - in relation to some of the "phenomena" he's identified, such as what he calls Catharsis), you can end up with narrow descriptions of aspects of the phenomenon and you can identify across a range of gamers a commonality of experience in relation to those narrow aspects. But what you'll find is that that commonality of experience is virtually if not quite identically the same as the commonality of experience in relation to a fuller concept of "immersion [in character]". As an analogy, you could try to split the concept of romantic love into different sub-categories or analyse different aspects of it from different angles, but if what you're trying to do is give advice on how to treat your boyfriend on Valentine's Day, is it really going to produce anything useful? Are you going to get significantly, i.e. usefully for the purpose of romantic advice, different commonalities of experience depending on whether you're asking about "romantic love where you care about your partner more than you care about yourself" or "romantic love where you like, respect, accept and desire your partner in every (or nearly every) aspect of them, even accepting their flaws"?<br/><br/>You can also use broader definitions, or define broader phenomena (e.g. Rob's idea of "Flow") but you then end up with something which varies so much from player to player that there won't be that identifiable commonality of experience. If by Flow Rob [perhaps idiosyncratically] means depth of engagement in play, obviously some people will get that from wargaming, some people will get it from story, some people will get it from the company of their friends, some people will get it from immersion in character, some people will get it from a mixture of those things, and so on and so forth. It's not even worth discussing.<br/><br/>So, basically, immersion [in character] becomes on that analysis a uniquely USEFUL concept to discuss, because it's simultaneously broad enough and narrow enough to get a distinctive commonality of experience among gamers which can then inform game design and game-PR. Those of us who play immersively in this sense and design and GM games to be immersive in this sense, we NEED a distinctive term, just as people who play for story need the term "story-games" and people who line up armies on a tabletop need the term "wargames". Nobody has that degree of need for a distinctive term for "deep engagement with the game in general" or for some narrow sub-concept of immersion in character which IMHO only represents in any event one perspective on an essentially unitary phenomenon.\n<blockquote>Have a look at page 97 (actually 114) in <a href="http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/" rel="nofollow">Beyond Role and Play</a>. The article is named The Character Interpretation: The Process Before the Immersion and the Game. I didn't get it at first, but then I talked to someone who played <b>Montsegur 1244</b> and we realized that that game uses the technique used in the article.</blockquote>\nI have played Montsegur 1244, and found it very patchy in terms of immersion. It was great right up until the point where I had to switch characters or adopt a "story-wide" perspective. Either of those things instantly broke me out of immersion in character whenever it happened, and actually felt psychologically uncomfortable, unpleasant, jarring.<br/><br/>In fact perhaps one of the things missing from the basic list I've proposed is "switching characters". It's pretty obvious that if it takes any degree of effort/time to "get into character", then having to get "out of" one character and "into" another is going to interrupt the experience for you. So obvious that I didn't include it in my poll under any kind of separate heading.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391615/#Comment_391615" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T01:52:55+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  1:52AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2012 1:53AM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>"Believable" is a term that has to be clarified; it varies a lot from game to game, what makes "believable" interaction and description. It is, to a degree, dependent on the internal logics of the genre.</blockquote>\nAgreed. I take that as a given.\n<blockquote>A lot of players have been railroaded by clumsy and insecure GMs, so it is easy to jump to the conclusion that <i>railroading</i> is bad. It is not. The paragraph should rather read like this; "Don't play with clumsy GMs".<br/><br/>Railroading is a technique, and when used right it will help players to focus on certain parts of a fiction. I've used it lots of times, and have had some of my most immersive and emotionally engaging games ever in scenarios based on this technique. </blockquote>\nIt might depend partly on precisely where you draw the line between railroading and not-railroading. The thing is, no matter how good you are at illusionism (by which I mean disguising your railroadiness), a player may at some point sense that their actions are having no real impact on the course of the game. If they sense that too starkly for their own comfort, it brings home to them the fact that their character isn't a real person, actually causing things to happen with cause and effect as a real person would, and that the player, therefore, isn't that real person (in the fictional world), actually causing things to happen with cause and effect as that fictional character would if they were real. I totally agree with you that if the illusion is perfect it does no harm to railroading, but the point is that no illusion can be utterly foolproof. Players are not daft. They may be able to ignore railroading if it's well enough disguised that it's not screaming in their face - but then again, they may not. Depends on the player. It's not just a question of like/dislike. It's a question of how their psychology works.\n<blockquote>"solid character concepts" is often interpreted as "detailed", and that interpretation often leads to clunky characters that is hard to play. My philosophy is that players seldom know what they are able to play, so let them make simple characters, and help them bring the characters alive when the game starts, in co-play. Doing it that way you ensure that the character grows from their ability, and as a natural part of the fiction (see "Keep things believable").</blockquote>\nI didn't intend to imply necessarily "detailed" and certainly not "clunky". But the level of detail which makes a sufficiently and not excessively filled-out and thus solid character will vary from player to player. Again it's not just a question of like/dislike. It's a question of how their psychology works. I think actually most players do have a reasonable idea of what they can play. If they design the character themself, they're not usually going to put in more detail than they can handle. <br/><br/>Incidentally, one of my best ever RPG experiences was at a LARP where I was given quite a detailed backstory that I basically had to learn in order to play the character. That backstory gave me an instant connection to many of the other characters and meant that most of the game could run off player-to-player interaction with plenty of conflict already there in the character backgrounds. It was really good. And it certainly involved knowing a lot of detail. But then again I do know gamers who wouldn't have coped with it at all.\n<blockquote>a believable experience of "the stranger" (a being with substantial differences to yourself).</blockquote>\nThis is a valid point and I've seen the debate over this issue surface repeatedly in a regular MET-LARP group. By and large I think the anti-personality-mechanics brigade are in the majority if you restrict your survey to players who regularly attain immersion in character. HOWEVER my own preference is for a "middle ground" where you use social mechanics at the start of the scene to inform the interaction (not in the middle, to break it), just as you put it in the bit I'm quoting next... \n<blockquote>My experience is that social mechanics needs to be fast-resolving. And they are best used in the start of a scene, to inform the interaction (not in the middle, to break it).</blockquote>\nI wholeheartedly agree. This seems to me to be a great way of steering a course between on the one hand (1) people being put off by being told what their character has to think or by not being able to just speak naturally in first person direct speech in-character dialogue and on the other hand (2) people being put off by only being able to play "themselves".  It's an approach I've proposed before in online discussions. In fact the game I'm currently designing, Soul's Calling, uses exactly this system, which I wheeled out for it at playtests last year, including at Indiecon. [I'm just hoping the game won't be too "clunky" for most, as my tolerance for "clunk" is higher than most people's, and I have included quite a bit of detail in some aspects of the game.] It's important of course that the mechanics only influence and do not rigidly dictate the course of the interaction. (Cf. railroading.) IMHO, it's best to confine the direct influence to how the GM roleplays the NPCs or feeds the players extra information, and let the players roleplay however feels natural to them.<br/><br/>In terms of the simplified statement in my precis of the thread/poll, avoiding social interaction mechanics is something which came up in the thread after I missed it off the poll - probably from people who've never tried the "Third Way" approach that you describe.\n<blockquote>Really important! Tidy room. Clear and mood-building character-sheets. Empty, wiped table. As little outside sounds as possible. A closed door. The GM is a focal point, so she needs to be placed against a neutral background, preferably dark (a dark curtain or empty wall is best). Other players are focal points too, so having all sitting in an empty, dark chamber is great.</blockquote>\nI wholeheartedly agree.<br/><br/>Great post of yours Tomas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391644/#Comment_391644" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T09:51:34+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  9:51AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2012 9:59AM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob's essay, it turns out, is only about 23 half-page-width columns long, and not 35 solid pages as I had imagined, so it was a lot less hassle to read than I expected. I've now read it. I have stuff to say here if I may in relation to Rob's observations upthread on my definition of immersion. I will post more general comments on Rob's essay on the thread he started to publicise that essay.<br/><br/>Well, <b>I'm just stumped</b>. Rob, you state/imply three definitions of immersion in your essay. Let's copy and paste them here. I quote your definitions in context, but I bold-highlight the parts which I consider to be attempts to define the term 'immersion', or to imply a clear definition of that term. I furthermore underline the parts which correspond to my definition of immersion.\n<blockquote><b>Immersionism focuses on deeply <span style="text-decoration: underline;">experiencing the character</span>, to the point of minimizing the sense of self.</b> This usually comes through a combination of the embodiment, flow, and catharsis motives, often within the context of a strong exploration interest. The focus on being the character often includes the protagonist motive as well \u2013 it's nice if your character has a visible impact on the world. Some immersionists valuecrafting ... exhibition is often viewed as a purely player motive and discouraged. Other playerfocused motives, such as fellowship, are often discouraged as well. [<i>Page 24</i>]</blockquote>\nI could almost underline "deeply" and "to the point of minimizing the sense of self". I don't simply because immersion can be at deeper or lighter levels, and because "dual consciousness" means that you don't necessarily minimise the sense of self. You might be simultaneously experiencing self and character, and that has enough in common with just experiencing the character that the two need to be considered together. I think when you say "Immersionism focuses on..." you mean "Immersion means...", and you mean that "Immersionism" is the pursuit of a heightened degree of immersion. In that sense, perhaps, the definition of "immersion" necessarily implied by the part I have quoted is only the underlined part, whereas the definition of "immersionism" is the whole of the bold part.\n<blockquote>...when combined with motives such as catharsis, flow and exploration, the result [<i>of embodiment</i>] is immersion \u2013 <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">experiencing a state </span>as<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> close </span>as possible<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to truly being the character</span> within the game world</b>... [<i>Page 13</i>]</blockquote>\nThe words 'within the game world' are unnecessary because, obviously, the character only exists within the game world. You've included them, I think, for emphasis, and I might do the same, but they're not at the heart of the definition.<br/><br/>Note that the parts I have underlined in this quotation map the meaning of the parts I underlined in the earlier quotation rather nicely.\n<blockquote>The goal of the flow motive is <b>to lose oneself in the moment</b>. Wikipedia (2011) defines flow as "a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and success in the process of the activity. "<b>When combined with other motives such as embodiment, catharsis, and exploration, this state is often called immersion</b>. [<i>Page 17</i>]</blockquote>\nI don't think that this matches your other two attempts to define immersion, and I think it fails as a definition because you are equating what you call "motives" with what you call a "state". Immersion is, IMHO, indeed a "state" (a psychological state), and a "state" is not the same as a "motive", though your motives might include a wish to attain a state, and a state might fuel certain motives. However, I would observe that "embodiment" can lead to "immersion" (as you acknowledge on page 13, cited above), and that "immersion" can promote "catharsis" as you define it in your essay, and that "exploration" can be performed in a state of immersion. Although your text on page 17 is somewhat confused, the definition of immersion that you use on pages 13 and 23 really still lies at the heart of it.<br/><br/>What I conclude from this exercise of textual analysis of your essay is that when you wrote this essay you actually applied the same definition of "immersion" that my "laymen's terms" for immersion on the Big Purple poll reflect:-\n<blockquote>Really this thread is for people who play games immersively in the sense that <b>they adopt a totally or more or less totally in-character point of view, reason as their character would, imagine being their character, empathise with their character, identify with their character, see the world through their character's eyes, feel their emotions, etc.</b> I'm not saying that this phenomenon will be uniform and identical for everyone. On the contrary, there'll be some variation. But the thread is for people who identify with the notion of <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">thinking of yourself as your character in some way during the game</span></b>. You might, perhaps, at the same time be thinking of other things - trying to make sure a particular player has a fun time, trying to construct a decent narrative, seeking out glory and adventure, trying to defeat the evil enemy, whatever. Or you might be content just to <b>"be" your character</b>.</blockquote>\nAgain I have highlighted the definitional parts and underlined the essential core of the definition.<br/><br/>Other ways of putting it include:-\n<blockquote><b>not just pretending to be an elf, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">feeling somewhat as if you are an elf, or feeling somewhat like an elf.</span></b></blockquote>\n<blockquote>In terms of a more pretentious version of the same definition:- <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a feeling, sense or experience of a degree of psychological unity with your character, or of a psychlogical connection with your character less immediate than psychological unity but of a similar basic nature.</span></b></blockquote>\nMy conclusion:- Rob, the concept that underlies the definition of immersion that you have implicitly adopted in your essay, on a fair view probably in two separate places, is the same concept that underlies the definition of immersion I implicitly adopted in the Big Purple poll thread. I think I have quoted every bit of the essay that actually mentions "immersion" or "immersionism" by name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391647/#Comment_391647" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T10:28:57+00:00" title="September 28, 2012 10:28AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I said: "Railroading is a technique" - and some more, claiming that railroading is a tool that may be used effectively to help immersion and engagement in a game.\n<blockquote>It might depend partly on precisely where you draw the line between railroading and not-railroading.

They call the adventures "linear" for a reason. They even use the word "linear" as a noun, as the name for the adventures. Of course it's nice to have a bit of real choice, but we just live with the fact that for organisational reasons (size of group; physicality of play) sometimes it just ain't happening, and the other immersive elements of LARP more than make up for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391665/#Comment_391665" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T13:03:54+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  1:03PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2012 1:04PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LOL!<br/><br/>It's not something I do regularly, but it is a technique I hold in my tool-box. The point is, to get back to topic; to make players focus on characters in ways they seldom do, and make them interact in new ways, to release potentials strange to them. When you succeed, you may help players immerse deeply in emotions and/or relationships, not focusing as much on what-to-do, but more on what-to-be/say/feel. There's a lot of interaction to explore in arenas like that.

Most opinions are. What you need to consider is what makes me (or others) form the opinions. Are the foundations of the opinion sound? Do the opinion stem from clear observations, or confusion?<br/><br/>Let me try to argue the case a bit more detailed. People trying to be <i>interesting</i> is a common mistake, and often leads to suspension of disbelief; the reactions of the characters, or the way we frame scenes, is in danger of getting so <i>interesting</i> they become totally unbelievable. A competition of interestingness is bound to lead the players astray, in my eyes, leaving them with no options but to top the previous silliness, to keep the game "interesting".<br/><br/>On the other hand; when keeping to the character, trying to react and act with reason, you build a character that is experienced as "true". We get characters which we are able to identify with, and identification is key to engagement. Engagement in the character we portray not only makes it more believable, but also feeds into the emotional content of the game, building in-game tensions. Whatever genre you play in, such tensions are the stuff gold are made of. <br/><br/>Whenever a conflict arises, with you being emotionally invested in your character, as well as in winning the conflict game-vise, the die-rolling and the dialogue gets another layer of engagement. That extra engagement makes it so much more common to have in-game conflicts soaring through the roof!

Many roleplayers play their characters in ways that lead to them doing something as their character and not knowing as a player why they did it, and only subsequently realising that they've adopted a certain reasoning-pattern of their character's. In other words, people roleplay instinctively and subconsciously. If you don't, fine, but that doesn't mean that other people don't, or that they shouldn't be able to discuss immersion in character as a separate phenomenon.\n<blockquote><br/>I was referring to the implication of what you just explicitly stated here.

If not, please try it some time. Some LARPs, by the way, are great, and others stink, so if the first few you try stink, try some totally different ones. Most roleplayers IME (not all, for sure) find immersion in character comes more naturally in LARP than in tabletop games, and is more intense.<br/><br/>I'm not for a moment saying that as a GM you don't get deeply absorbed / involved in the game, and "immersion" in the natural sense of the word isn't necessarily wholly inapt to describe that. What I'm saying is that that phenomenon of deep absorption / involvement in the game is not an interesting topic for discussion because it relates to such a broad and variable and individual and subjective phenomenon that if you were to investigate what promotes it for people, you would find a total disarray of different answers and no common ground to base conclusions on. In fact, you might find that the results cluster around the various major playstyles, including storygaming (which some people find hugely engaging) and immersion in character. Whilst you can refer to what you experience as a GM as "immersion" if you insist, and it's not a woeful abuse of language [I've used the term that way myself in the past], the fact is that as a concept it has no real practical usefulness. That's not to deny or invalidate your experience of deep involvement in the game. It's just to say that it's not something we can usefully talk about as a basis for (1) communicating what sort of game we are offering or (2) discussing how to design a "better" game, unlike immersion in character.<br/><br/>But ultimately, forget all that. Just get yourself along to a few LARPs if you haven't already. It's when you're in a tense situation in character and you actually feel your heartbeat quickening and you feel the anger/fear/zeal rising within you that it hits home... this is something distinct and different, something that just doesn't happen the same way (for the vast majority of gamers I mean - not all) when you're GMing [edited to add:- it possibly could in relation to a particular NPC you focus on a lot, of course]. It's qualitatively different from the general experience of GMing, certainly for me, and probably for most people who've experienced it. I don't mean for everyone. Maybe, even, not for you. So be it. But the fact that you're one of the people who doesn't experience it as a distinct phenomenon doesn't mean that others don't do so. We assuredly do. And we need a term to explain and identify our distinct experience, communicate it to others, analyse it and promote the sorts of games and gaming sessions where it's intended to be facilitated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391759/#Comment_391759" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T09:04:22+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  9:04AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2012 9:10AM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>\n<blockquote>Most players I know of believes that they have to be interesting in a role-playing game, while the best game-play actually takes place when none of us tries to be "interesting".

I think it also matches my psychology more or less. I don't think it holds true for everyone.<br/><br/>What I would argue and to this extent we're almost in agreement is that this degree of commonality among many [not all] gamers reflects the psychological roots of the process common to many gamers. There is a meaningful and distinct phenomenon here and it has reliable indicators and elements and so forth.<br/><br/>This is significant and useful because if you want to promote a certain kind of in-game experience you can formulate guidelines (as I have tried to do in the OP) to help you facilitate this playstyle for a significant proportion of players.<br/><br/>What you have to always remember though is that it won't work this way for everyone. Some players won't immerse in character. Others will, but their minds work differently and what works for the majority may not always work for them.<br/><br/>It's important to remember that key point for at least two reasons:-<br/>(1) so that the minority immersive gamers don't feel excluded/bullied by the majority immersive gamers, leading to flame wars etc.<br/>(2) so that you don't set up false expectations leading to gamers being disappointed when the proposed solution doesn't work for them - as it's never guaranteed that they will.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ritualz" title="Ritualz"><img alt="Ritualz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ritualz">Ritualz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391762/#Comment_391762" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T09:25:11+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  9:25AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But ultimately, forget all that.

Shamans regularly do spirit-journeys. I've participated in a handful of those now, and have found the experience to be similar to the immersion in character, in a role-playing game. I've come to consider role-playing games a ritualistic praxis, and as in any ritual; the way you initiate it, and the way the participants maintain it, will make the difference between a mundane game, and a truly magic experience.

Not sure I would choose "Modern" to mean "GM-less"; I would rather just call that "GM-less".<br/><br/>Regarding transpersonal states, it seems to me that immersion and shamanic spirit-journeys both have a great deal in common with hypnosis, shamanic spirit-journeys probably more so. I haven't been on a shamanic spirit-journey myself, but I knew someone who had and who after being hypnotised basically said it was the same thing. Everything I know about the theory of hypnosis tends to suggest that it would account for many of the "spiritual" sensations of major religious practices. I guess immersion draws on some of the same mental faculties as the ability to enter hypnotic trance but I'm not convinced that it's exactly the same thing. Certainly, the phrase "the power of suggestion" would appear to be relevant to both, as would the phrase "bypassing the critical faculties".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391835/#Comment_391835" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T00:41:58+00:00" title="September 30, 2012 12:41AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2012 12:43AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <i>power of suggestion</i> is indeed an interesting phrase in relation to immersion, yes.

It is hard to hypnotize someone who don't want to be.<br/><br/>In a game, we use the power of suggestion on each other, and our willingness to accept the suggestions cast a spell on the group as a whole. On one level we immerse in character, and on another level we immerse in <i>the interactive field</i>. The interactive field is key in keeping the group on the same page, and in creating a fiction with inner logic; the stuff that makes us believe in the actions and reactions of the characters; the stuff that convince us this is "real stuff". The "group spell" is our immersion in the interactive field. <br/><br/>I believe the interactive field is the reason GMs, playing NPCs and "the table" (framing scenes, feeding dialogue, working dilemmas, managing conflicts, etc), may experience strong immersion too. It is of another kind, but it may be as deeply felt. A games-master may play an NPC in a single scene, and bring herself into a crying fit real fast, by connecting to the interactive field. As a professional GM for 17 years I've found the interactive field to be my most valuable ally; it makes NPC-work easy, and building emotional content in interaction something I do with great joy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391840/#Comment_391840" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T01:45:08+00:00" title="September 30, 2012  1:45AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2012 1:53AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Dark-challenge thread I've posted a game that is heavily dependent on immersion to work; <i>The Life and Death Act of 2021</i>. <br/><br/>It has next to no mechanics; all is resolved in dialogue.

In fact I read somewhere that victims of trauma sometimes enter a state akin to hypnotic trance. However it is much more difficult to hypnotise someone if they're not willing to cooperate in the basic preliminaries that lead to hypnosis - e.g. if they're not willing to watch the swinging pendant. Nonetheless you can use covert methods and trickery, and a skilful hypnotist can do it quite easily. Watch some Derren Brown. I don't think it's faked.\n<blockquote>I believe the interactive field is the reason GMs, playing NPCs and "the table" (framing scenes, feeding dialogue, working dilemmas, managing conflicts, etc), may experience strong immersion too.

Whilst some GMs may experience plugging into the interactive field in the same depth as they experience immersion in character when playing, I think there's enough gamers out there who have unique experiences (unique for them) through immersion in character to qualify immersion in character as deserving a distinctive name.\n<blockquote>As a professional GM for 17 years</blockquote>\nNow that one little snippet is potentially the most interesting thing in the thread so far.

A lot of stories narrate how status change between people (going from low to high, or vice-versa), and that is quite interesting. <br/><br/>In role-playing games you can make the players relate to each other in different ways, by setting up differences in status between their characters. With simple elements you may inspire players to explore the conflicts inherent in the hierarchy, and to identify with holding a high or low position in it. And that is one simple step towards immersion. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>One example is when you have a group making characters. As a GM you may state that one of them must be a baron, and one other must be his servant. When two of the players have chosen those roles, you proceed to give <i>the baron</i> more points to build his character, on account of him having a veery good upbringing. You leave the servant alone, but <i>the thief</i> of the group gets a tiny fraction less to build with, on account on him having such a bad upbringing. Be sure all of the players take notice of this, so they all know that you (the world) is partial to the baron, and not nice to the thief. And then you tell them that the baron will be the leader of the group, maybe disregarding which character has the talent for leadership. Such tricks will reflect in their game-play. Your support of the leader will reflect in game-play too, as it will help make the hierarchy of the group a natural thing for the characters to consider.<br/><i>Caveat: some players believe they would protest against such a hierarchy, but my experience says that players accept it gladly. When such status differences are presented in tune with the setting, there is no reasonable player who will object to it. It is a way of stepping out of our world, and into something quite different.</i><br/>- and that is where we all want to be, in a role-playing game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391875/#Comment_391875" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T12:31:16+00:00" title="September 30, 2012 12:31PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... I don't know about the whole baron/servant/thief scenario. It <i>could</i> work, but it could be very frustrating for the players in the weaker position. A lot depends surely on the personalities and social/intellectual skills of the players.<br/><br/>Actually a neat illustration comes to mind. I know a girl who plays a (powerful and magical) slave character in a LARP. She's played the slave character with different masters, and sometimes she really enjoyed it, and sometimes she really hated it because the "master" went about being "master" in the wrong way. The stronger character's player has to let the weaker character self-actualise.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I know from experience that with most of my home-group players I would face insurmountable resistance to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391876/#Comment_391876" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T12:33:11+00:00" title="September 30, 2012 12:33PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But getting back on topic... who pays you to GM, and how did that get started?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391890/#Comment_391890" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T15:14:02+00:00" title="September 30, 2012  3:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing the weaker part in a hierarchy can be frustrating.

It amazes me that people dispute it exists, conflate it with other concepts or suggest other peculiar terms for it. However, like pornography I admit it's hard to define exactly. Stick with the idea. If you make the assumption it exists, many techniques arise.<br/><br/>My old group, untouched for many years by any other form of roleplaying does it and know perfectly well what it means. There are techniques I uses in traditional games which you can use to encourage it. For example, my group would be uncomfortable with creating content as players, but through their characters; no problem. So, I couldn't say to a player "there's a town nearby, what's it like?" but I could ask them as their character to design and build a town in character and deduct resources and they'd be all over it. Their characters are sufficiently powerful in the game world to justify this.<br/><br/>Players might suggest content by offering up suggestions for content indirectly, so asking leading questions about the environment. They know perfectly well that I do make some stuff up as I go along, but there are also preplanned elements and I try to keep this seamless, and they conspire to keep it so. They aren't interested in building a story directly, though if one emerges from their character interactions, that's fine. Sitting round a table playing Fiasco would be utterly alien; the idea that it's in the same category of game would be strange to most of them. That said, this isn't true of all the players - a couple play non-traditional games, and yet they can do character immersion too, while understanding the techniques at a higher level, too. I am much more likely to discuss some of the inner workings of the game with them now, but still, we talk about the campaign as a real thing rather than as a combination of the creative input of the participants. The players know that at any time their characters can go off and do whatever they want (and they occasionally do) so it's up to me to provide plausible and engaging threats and opportunities. Most of my pre-prepared material gets used at some point.<br/><br/>Another example - that of interaction between players whose characters are not present at a scene - "ghost voices." The pressure for this to happen is strong; it allows the participation of other players in individual scenes, but it wears at the edge of immersion. For a long time we forbade it, but an in-character solution was developed - the Lingua Enigma, a magical network which allows them to see and communicate with each other at a distance. This was ideal - the pressure to create it led to a great game session and it solved a system issue without breaking immersion.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391930/#Comment_391930" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T06:27:31+00:00" title="October  1, 2012  6:27AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2012 6:29AM by omnifray.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Simon Rogers, yes, this is broadly in line with how I see things; in particular the notion rings a bell with me of trying to find game-fictional justifications and parallels for things which are convenient/desirable at a metagame level.<br/><br/>But what do you mean by "at a higher level"? Surely your purely immersive/trad players understand exactly what's going on when you're GMing... the only thing is that the personal significance it has to them is not the same as the personal significance it would have to, say, a devotee of Forge theory. Starting from the basis that this is a question of personal focus based on what the person in question thinks is relevant to the debate (their answer to that question will be informed by subjective values), their view of this is perfectly valid. There may be aspects where a theory-based approach throws some light on some of what you're doing, but other aspects where too rigorous a dependency on potentially artifically aspects of theory actually clouds the real issues. I mean - a lot of theory manages to sound objective, while being based on wholly subjective assumptions and value-judgments which are rarely fully and explicitly acknowledged.

Honestly, the whole thing strikes me as a case of being used to your tools, and can see through them (or with them) to the fictional world.<br/><br/>Any new tool - learning to ride a motorcycle, for example - feels strange, overwhelming the rider with new sensations.  This all fades with time as the rider adapts.  Before long, they can meaningfully start talking about the feel of the road (which of course they can't feel, except through a 100kg vibrating metal frame) and the tranquility of the road (despite sitting on top of a gas motor that's blasting away at a deafening 115dB).<br/><br/>One of the most immersive role-playing experiences I'm aware of is psychodrama, which gets people into role so deeply that their hands go sweaty at the prospect of having a difficult conversation.  This, despite the fact that - at a conversational level - the vast majority of what's said is out-of-character speech concerned with the mechanics of the procedure.  "Stand here, stand there, would so-and-so have delivered the line this way?  Did the person playing your sister get it right?"  To top it off, those involved can be <i>changing roles</i> as often as every thirty seconds!<br/><br/>If you take a poll to learn what techniques create immersion, I posit you're going to wind up sampling fairly traditional play conventions, because these are the ones that are most familiar to the mass of gamers.<br/><br/>Games whose mechanics are the most self-consciously about trying to create a different play experience look the least "immersionist", because these are the most mechanically unfamiliar.<br/><br/>If it was, say, Fiasco that had been written in 1974, I think this conversation would look rather different!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392013/#Comment_392013" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T17:44:32+00:00" title="October  1, 2012  5:44PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's correct, and completely able to explain all discussion of immersion, period.

It's a set of GM techniques which help people immerse in character. It is not the same as what I understand "magical tea party" to be. It's not the same as rolling secretly, hiding the system or fudging die rolls (which are occasionally useful, but I have found them much less so over the years).  I gave some examples above. What's hidden is GM technique - they don't know usually know what's written down or pre-planned or what's improvised. I think you can only do this if you have a vast amount of knowledge about the setting; whether its your made up fantasy world or a real world setting with which you are familiar. It's one of the reasons that real-world settings are good and that (for me) Night's Black Agents has been such a revelation.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, incorporation is present, but not direct, for example "is there an X here?" Any "your character could not do that's" are dealt with quickly, and we allow players to backtrack if their actions were relying on something working which can't. There is no "should not", but I'll certainly warn people of the consequences of their choices. Introducing new players is not tricky; you simply make their characters unfamiliar with the world, so the player's ignorance is the character' ignorance. It also allows them to do things that are socially unacceptable in a plausible fashion.<br/><br/>At one point I thought it was just the group dynamics rather than the GM techniques, but I've tried this with other groups in the same setting, and if you can speak authoritatively about the background as if it's real because of your familiarity then it works really well.<br/><br/>It does at the outset require some preparation, so you speak with the authority, but as time goes on and the threads connect, this diminishes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392053/#Comment_392053" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T03:14:03+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  3:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2012 5:01AM by omnifray.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>, no.<br/><br/>[<i>First, to get a trivial observation out of the way. There's precious little difference between hit points in D&amp;D and health levels in WW games IME, at least in MET-LARP versions of the WW games, which WW tabletoppers can be presumed to be reasonably familiar with</i>.] <br/><br/>It goes way beyond mechanical familiarity, and the simple proof of that is the way that out-of-character banter can ruin people's immersion in LARP - including people who are utterly familiar with the conventions of tabletop gaming including the relatively greater acceptability of chit-chat there. Thus, there is at least one way that immersion can be broken which demonstrably has nothing to do with mechanical familiarity.<br/><br/>Another example which isn't quite as easily demonstrable but is nonetheless true is the general proposition that out-of-character  thinking [e.g. "Author-Stance"] breaks/strains immersion for many gamers. This has nothing to do with mechanical familiarity, and rather more to do with the essence of immersion, though I accept that for complicated reasons it doesn't necessarily work in this way for everyone. The essence of immersion [in character] is that you feel somewhat as if you are your character or you feel somewhat like them. It's obviously going to tend to be easier to do that, subject to complex psychological factors, if you are thinking like your character. I have spent a great deal of time GMing, and a great deal of time mixing in-character and out-of-character thinking, for instance while playing NPCs, but also for a variety of reasons while playing. Probably the vast majority of the people polled on the TBP poll could say the same thing. Yet there is a strong vote to the effect that dissociated mechanics and "Author-Stance" break or strain immersion. The essence of those two things is of course out-of-character thinking.<br/><br/>Thus, for many gamers, it's not merely the habit of purely in-character thinking which makes out-of-character thinking break/strain their immersion. It's something rather more inherent in out-of-character thinking itself.<br/><br/>[The caveats include that if you've already visualised something in your head perhaps instinctively and without consciously dreaming it up, not being able to give voice to it in "Author Stance" may actually hamper your immersion. A minority of immersive gamers would seem to find this problematic.]<br/><br/>Another example is switching characters. I found frequently switching characters in Montseguar 1244 to be repugnantly counter-immersive for me. I imagine many, many gamers would feel the same way. That's not due to some unfamiliarity with the concept of switching characters. I switch characters all the time when I'm GMing. Maybe I briefly immerse in those characters when I'm GMing, and my immersion is broken up when I switch characters. But I found that more painful, and I do mean painful, when I was playing Montsegur 1244, probably because I had gotten more deeply immersed than I do when I'm GMing, probably because when I'm GMing I have so many other things to think about and in short so much out-of-character thinking to do (see above). And I have known other immersive/trad gamers complain about having to switch characters for the same reason. In fact, come to think about it, there was a time in the past when a group I gamed with insisted on everyone running multiple characters in a game of D&amp;D, and I remember I hated it and insisted that I only wanted to play one character. The reason is you can't get deeply into character with several characters at once. Or maybe some people can, but many can't.<br/><br/>Where mechanical familiarity obviously does play a role is in the individual's judgment of what is believable (and thus suspension of disbelief) and what is a dissociated mechanic (and thus requires you to think in an out-of-character way). As I may have mentioned, my version of the test for a dissociated mechanic is:- does the rule lead you the player to reason along lines which fail to sufficiently closely model a reasoning process that your character could sufficiently reasonably have? Both instances of the word "sufficiently" there are subjective. And that completely covers the case of hit points in any event. So I'm not saying that there is no truth whatsoever lying behind what you say. But what I'm saying is that you are mistaking a small part of the truth for the whole scenario.<br/><br/>I don't think it's constructive to insist that the *only* reason why immersive/trad gamers tend to find trad games more immersive is that that's what they're used to. Do you claim to understand their gaming habits better than they do? Do you claim to be a better judge of their psychology than they are? I would urge you to consider that it's inherently improbable that trad games should have evolved the way they have, and that story games should have evolved the way they have, without each having some inherent advantages and disadvantages, for some groups of gamers, over the other. A major advantage of trad games over storygames, possibly the single major advantage of trad games over storygames, is the way they promote immersion for a certain proportion of gamers.

Let me give you feeling for some of the games I've played.<br/><br/>As a child, BECMI D&amp;D, AD&amp;D 1st edition, AD&amp;D 2nd edition, WHFRP 1st edition, Dragon Warriors and one game of Paranoia, plus some related games which aren't RPGs, like WHFB, WH40K, Space Hulk, HeroQuest (the boardgame), Advanced HeroQuest (the boardgame/RPG hybrid) and Shogun. I actually wrote the basics for my own RPG when I was seven years old (I called it "Warlords and Warlocks"), although I don't think I ever got it as far as playing a game of it. In my later teens, my own homebrew game and foam-sword LARP. In my early 20s, foam-sword LARPs.<br/><br/>In my later 20s, a Middle Earth game with the Deadlands system, D&amp;D 3rd edition (maybe 3.5), WHFRP 2nd edition, AD&amp;D 1st edition, foam-sword LARPs and my own system (singular, at that time).<br/><br/>In my 30s (maybe very late 20s too), MET-LARP V:tR on an almost weekly basis over several years, a variety of occasional homebrew salon LARPs including some made by other people and one made by me, regular foam-sword LARPs, more D&amp;D 3rd edition / 3.5 (weekly for maybe a year), Pathfinder, my own systems (extensively, including at various cons) and finally a variety of games including storygames as one-offs at two trips to Indiecon, including Montsegur 1244, I Would Do Anything For Lady Katja, Fiasco, a freeform RPG, Call of Cthulhu and the very trad full-crunch Cursed Empire.<br/><br/>I have since my late 20s spent countless hours poring over theory discussions, taking part in debates about RPG theory on TBP and the Pundit's site, discussing game theory face to face and even writing about it, for instance my 50-page essay I've linked to elsewhere on the Art and Theory of Immersive Roleplay.<br/><br/>I can hardly be considered to be an inexperienced, unsophisticated or unthinking gamer, nor are my horizons limited to trad games.<br/><br/>I also happen to swallow rules like a fish swallows water, and I am very open-minded to trying new things. <br/><br/>I can categorically assure you that there are mechanics I am intimately familiar with that I find repugnantly counter-immersive, and that I have played in games with unfamiliar mechanics or ways of gaming without it detracting from my immersion in any significant way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392060/#Comment_392060" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T05:26:25+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  5:26AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You can't see the village from inside it. </blockquote>\nI'm not quite sure I follow your meaning.\n<blockquote>And not irrational, just incomplete.</blockquote>\nYou see, to me, the assertion that for instance nothing is lost from a game by affording players the opportunity of "Author Stance" and "Director Stance" is just unimaginative and unthinking. I'm not saying for a minute that nothing is gained too, or that people shouldn't play games with "Author Stance" and "Director Stance", or that there are no gamers who'll enjoy such games more than trad games.

I have no dog in this fight - I get different things from different games. If a game distributes authority in certain specific ways, and certain conceits and techniques are followed, character immersion is more likely to result.

What I meant was restricted to what I literally said:- there isn't a great deal of difference between health levels as I understand them and hit points as I understand them. They're not <i>identical</i>. I didn't say there was literally <i>no</i> difference. I did use the phrase "IME", "in my experience", which is not infinite. And I've also emphasised that the judgment of what is a dissociated mechanic is subjective in two key respects. I'm not suggesting that if a WW LARPer claimed to find hit points dissociated but not health levels then that was a hallucination on their part. The way their psychology works is... however it works. You need infer nothing more about what I meant or what motivated me to write the bit you're very loosely paraphrasing than simply that I found your assertion a little surprising, and that sometimes people's minds work in what may seem to someone else (e.g. me) to be funny ways. And I personally know tons of WW LARPers who've never complained about hit points or who complained equally about hit points and health levels for the same reasons, and none who've ever complained about hit points on the basis they were somehow less good than WW health levels. So I expressed my surprise, nothing more. There's no need to put words into my mouth or make a straw-man out of an inference from something I've said.\n<blockquote>Nope, there is absolutely nothing, period, that has anything to do with immersion that divides the two. Ars Magica has multiple characters. Fiasco has no mechanics that require players to ever drop out of character. D&amp;D has a morality system.

The essential difference between the two IMO lies not in the product name attached to the rules book but, primarily at least, in the implementation at the table. And one player could be roleplaying tradly while another is storygaming at the same table. Sure, some games we can think of as basically storygames and some as trad games, and let's do that for the purposes of what I say next, but remember the real essence of the distinction is how the game is played.<br/><br/>Partly you're exaggerating/misunderstanding my position because you're construing what I say as if there were a brightline distinction between the rules of storygames and the rules of trad games, so that you can say, for instance, that D&amp;D is a trad game and Montsegur 1244 is a storygame and every game ever published falls on one side or the other of the divide. That's not remotely what I'm saying.<br/><br/>What I'd say is that there is a "central case" of a trad RPG, which is probably something like AD&amp;D 1st edition, and there is a central case of a storygame, which isn't even Montsegur 1244 but possibly a hypothetical construct of a GMless game where you don't even do direct speech dialogue and where you swap characters on a whim from player to player or operate them simultaneously or whatever. And other games may be at one end of the spectrum or the other or somewhere in the middle, but don't be thinking for a moment that I mean that it's literally a one-dimensional continuum, because there are many facets to it. And some features of typical storygames are inconvenient for immersion for many gamers (I don't say all gamers). On the other hand, that doesn't mean that every trad game is marvellous for immersion. Far from it. In fact, a "poorly" implemented trad game ("poor" from the point of view of immersion) will be immeasurably worse for immersion than a game like Fiasco or Montsegur 1244. Indeed, on another site I posted something to that effect yesterday or the day before.<br/><br/><b>But the case that I'm making is that there are many conventions of play <i>typical</i> in trad games which foster immersion for most immersively-oriented gamers to a greater extent than their counterpart conventions of play in the <i>central case</i> of storygames.</b><br/><br/>Those conventions of play of the central case of a trad game include:-<br/>(1) relative emphasis on believability, "realism" or simulation [NB though AD&amp;D 1st ed books state they are not a simulation game]<br/>(2) minimal or no dissociated mechanics<br/>(3) players affect the game-fiction only through their characters (no "Director Stance")<br/>(4) players essentially reason as their characters would reason (no or very little "Author Stance")<br/>(5) a player having one character and sticking with that character through the game<br/>(6) character creation preceding play<br/>(7) minimal if any personality mechanics<br/>(8) minimal, unintrusive social conflict mechanics if any<br/>(9) direct speech 1st person dialogue [people who played with Gary Gygax mention this... I'm not saying it's universal]<br/><br/>The failure to understand immersion is IMHO, YMMV, typically what leads people to view play as literally simulation-oriented when its emphasis on believability is greater than necessary for "story" or "game". In fact, for immersive gamers detailed simulation is not itself the point, but rather immersion requires a certain minimum threshold of believability, depending on the gamer. Greater emphasis than that on believability would be wasted for that gamer. Beyond the minimum, more is pointless.<br/><br/>I am aware that aspects of AD&amp;D could be considered at odds with (7) and (8), but they have minimal if any impact on how the game is actually played IME. E.g. reaction rolls and alignment. They make very little practical difference to the game.<br/><br/>I am aware that a case could be made that (1) and (9) could equally be said to be the case for storygames as for immersive games, depending on your perspective.<br/><br/>I know Ars Magic has multiple characters. I technically disagree with you about Fiasco - you have to award dice to other players, which is utterly dissociated - but you may think that's nitpicky of me. Whatever. Some people say BW is a trad game; some say it's "indie" or a "storygame". What about Everway or Prince Valiant? There isn't always a clear answer. I've never played Ars Magica. If you play one character for a session, I have no problem with switching characters between sessions. I don't even mind that much breaking a session into 2-hour mini-sessions where you stick with one character, though it's not ideal. It's when you're changing back and forth every 5, 10, 15 minutes that it's really counter-immersive (for me).<br/><br/><b>The point is simply that these are typical features of trad play which at least in respect of items (2) through (8) are very different, arguably, to the central case of a storygame, and which, for more immersive gamers than not, support immersion.</b><br/><br/>The existence of certain games commonly thought of as trad which differ in some respects from this list is really beside the point. <br/><br/>I mean honestly, do you think I know so little about RPGs that I assume every game commonly thought of as trad is always played as per (1) to (9) and no games commonly thought of as storygames ever are? You might have a better chance of understanding what I say if you don't make such uncharitable assumptions.\n<blockquote>Fair enough, I suppose my theory is only 99 percent right. I will have to live with that.</blockquote>\nFar less than that, I'm afraid.

Not impossible, but harder.<br/><br/>He also says that some classical role-playing games are counter-immersive. Not all mechanics are suited to immersive game-play.

My observations are about the central case of each of two "types" of game and the central case of each of two "types" of gamer. Your wife's case disproves nothing.<br/><br/>You should be able to see that I quite clearly do not consider storygaming and immersive gaming to be literal opposites of each other. To illustrate this, an example. I myself find Montsegur 1244 and Fiasco, whilst in some respects jarring and in Montsegur 1244's case painful on my immersion, actually (1) more fun and (2) more immersive than any game of D&amp;D 3.5 I have ever played. [Edited to add:- on reflection, I mean - in a short-term way. I think D&amp;D 3.5 is nonetheless more compelling for replay value, for me. I would go back to it more readily than the storygames. Or maybe that's just because I'm willing to appease my friends who want to play it. I dunno.]<br/><br/>In fact my personal idiosyncracies and rules-swallowing tendencies are such that unlike many gamers I can thrive, immersively, in very deep waters of excessively detailed games. D&amp;D 3.5 however sticks in my throat like the spine of a cod. A short list of key features which have this effect on me are (1) attacks of opportunity, (2) relentless emphasis on combat - I love combat, but enough is enough already, (3) the complete refusal of the groups I've played D&amp;D 3.5 with to sustain for longer than 2 minutes anything resembling my personal, subjective concept of roleplay, (4) the cardboard cut-out nature of the NPCs thrown at me in games of D&amp;D 3.5, (5) the DM irritating me by insisting that the game is balanced when it isn't {I wouldn't mind if he would just admit that some classes are demonstrably more powerful than others at a particular level of play}, (6) the combat system in general (armour class, attack bonuses, damage - they're not dissociated, but they still suck) and (7) did I mention attacks of opportunity. Maybe (6) isn't a major factor for me as I quite like AD&amp;D and BECMI though to be honest I've done far more DMing of them than playing.<br/><br/>I read the initial blog where the concept of dissociated mechanics was invented and sure, it was in an anti-4e context as I read it. That doesn't mean it has no wider usefulness. It's not been central to my thinking about roleplaying games and still isn't, but it's a feature people have brought up in relation to immersion in forum debates, and that's how it got into my poll, where it received significant voter attention. However, I have always <i>hated with a passion</i> the way Fate Points are done in WHFRP 2e, which may be the same as in 1e (don't remember), namely that they effectively guarantee survival plus nonsensical healing. And that's a mechanic I'm plenty familiar with. But the only fix I need to cope with Fate Points in WHFRP 2e is to make them, say, a 50% chance of survival with no healing effect, and they would work for me. For me - NOT necessarily for a substantial, indeed very substantial proportion of immersive gamers. And it transpires that the concept of "dissociated mechanics" neatly explains why. {That said, I would still choose WHFRP 2e over D&amp;D 3.5 any day of the week. It's more immersive too, for me.}<br/><br/>@ TomasHVM, I guess maybe I use the word "storygame" in the sense that you use the word "narrative game".

This does not mean that AD&amp;D 1st edition is not an old-school RPG nor that some observations about OD&amp;D are of no application to AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>The central case of a legal system would be the internal legal system of a civilised country with courts of law (to interpret and apply the law), methods of legal enforcement (e.g. police) and recognition of the concept of the rule of law. This does not mean that public international law is not law, nor that a country magically has no legal system just because its recognition of the concept of the rule of law is a bit iffy.<br/><br/>The central case of immersive tabletop roleplaying gaming might be, subjectively, a game where:-<br/><br/>(1) there is nil or negligible sharing of narrative authority - the GM is the conduit to the game-world<br/>(2) everything is as believable as reasonably possible<br/>(3) people whenever possible use 1st person direct speech for in-character speech<br/>(4) there are no dissociated mechanics or players are not required to use them<br/>(5) players never engage in out-of-character thinking in order to make decisions for their characters<br/>- they're never thinking about what will make a good story<br/>(6) the rules aren't too clunky<br/>(7) players have one character only<br/>(8) each player character is fleshed out in some detail before play starts, with a strong character concept, including backstories<br/>(9) (ed) social conflict mechanics if they exist at all are designed so as not to interrupt freeform dialogue nor constrain how players roleplay<br/>(10) there are no personality mechanics or none that the players *have* to be aware of or think about<br/>(11) there is no out-of-character banter going on<br/>(12) the playing space is free of distractions<br/>(13) the GM skilfully uses the right sorts of descriptive approach, expressions, posture etc. to foster immersion<br/>(14) everyone knows enough about the game-world to roleplay consistently with it<br/><br/>The above might be considered my ideal. But that doesn't mean that if you take some of these elements away it magically stops being immersive roleplay.<br/><br/>As for whether what your wife does is storygaming, I dunno. On the one hand, she cares about the story. On the other hand, she never applies thought during the game itself to the conscious creation of story. Perhaps if she does so subconsciously, that might mean that she's storygaming. If not, on reflection, I don't see what she does as having any distinctive story features except that she is passively enjoying the story as it happens. What she's actively doing is simply and purely roleplaying. Her motivations and passive enjoyment seem irrelevant to me if what you're trying to do is describe what she's doing when she plays. Here's an easy analogy. If I play a game of Go with someone less experienced than myself, I want them to learn, and beat me, with the benefit of the handicap I give them. But when I'm actually playing that game, I play ruthlessly. I play because I want them to learn and beat me, and I enjoy it if/when they do, but that's not HOW I play. I'm not playing "let them beat me". I'm playing to win. And it seems to me, well from your description anyway, that that's a bit like your wife playing roleplaying games. She's playing because she wants story, and she enjoys story, but she doesn't play in a story way. She plays in a story-neutral way; she simply roleplays.<br/><br/>The only rider to that is that as I've said the concept of what makes the best story is subjective.<br/><br/>But hang on a minute, small epiphany:- if her concept of what makes the best story is simply the result of natural roleplay (on her part, and GMing on someone else's, but that's what someone else is doing, not her), then her concept of story is coterminous with roleplay. Calling it a storygame therefore adds nothing to the idea of what it is, because her idea of story-making (on her part, in the context that someone else is GMing) is the same as her idea of roleplay (on her part).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392095/#Comment_392095" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T11:04:02+00:00" title="October  2, 2012 11:04AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2012 11:48AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to discuss the points in your central case of immersive role-playing:<br/><br/><b>(1) there is nil or negligible sharing of narrative authority - the GM is the conduit to the game-world</b><br/>- I've made some modern rpgs the last years, that works with players framing scenes, and still these games are deeply immersive. It has to do with the method being deceptively simple (nearly as simple and intuitive as a normal conversation); players frame scenes with a minimum of effort.<br/>- one point though; it's a rare role-playing game where players don't share some narrative authority; they normally join in with descriptions of what their characters do. So players tend to jump in and out of the immersive state; the key is to make the transitions as fast and smooth as possible.<br/><br/><b>(2) everything is as believable as reasonably possible</b><br/>- As said: the fiction should be believable within the framework of the genre. And more; the character-relations and interpretations must be identifiable, or recognizable on some personal level. The same is true for dillemmas faced by the character.

Story is (usually) the only thing she's concerned about when she's roleplaying.  It just so happens that the vast majority of stories are primarily about character decisions and their consequences. Saying she's not concerned with story betrays a lack of knowledge about what stories are.  She is absolutely, firmly, dedicated to story each and every time she makes a character decision.  Your "coterminous" idea is very close to correct, not just for her, but for <i>absolutely everyone roleplaying</i> in a story-oriented manner.  Character decisions are the building blocks of story - consequences are the glue holding them together. Someone who is absolutely, fervently dedicated to story as the target of their play absolutely MUST have character decisionmaking as the central element.  Acting like these two things only sometimes overlap is silly.  Perhaps a tiny, tiny percentage of stories don't have character decisions as their central element.  That's the only time there's any conflict.<br/><br/>Now, some games ask you to handle consequences of your decisions too (narration-passing), and I absolutely agree there's a distinction to be made there, but the distinction is not that these games are somehow ONLY story-oriented. Primetime Adventures can be played in a "let's find out what a TV show with these traits would be like" explorative way and Universalis can be played in a "let's create this broad history and setting" creation-oriented way, without any real story concerns in the normal sense of the word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392104/#Comment_392104" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T11:52:17+00:00" title="October  2, 2012 11:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think it's constructive to insist that the *only* reason why immersive/trad gamers tend to find trad games more immersive is that that's what they're used to.

A crucial point! Some players don't understand the importance of "letting your character talk"; how it is the basis of a stronger identification with character, opening the path to immersion.<br/>- characters speaking with each other, is a great support for all participating players. Nothing is as conductive to immersion as vivid and impromptu character-dialogue.<br/><br/><b>(4) there are no dissociated mechanics or players are not required to use them</b><br/>- tactical considerations outside your character, is bad for immersion, yes. <br/>- mechanics heavy on abstract tactics can lead to great games, but often they lack in character-identification; it becomes a pawn to move in a board-game with character-glazing. Not much immersion in that.<br/><br/><b>(5) players never engage in out-of-character thinking in order to make decisions for their characters<br/>- they're never thinking about what will make a good story</b><br/>- oh, but they will! Not all the time, and perhaps not in every game-session, but people are of two minds (at least), and will switch back and forth in their thinking in any activity that involves a meta-level. You have to work to minimize meta-thinking, and to secure smooth transitions. It may be a break in immersion, but it should not be perceived as such.<br/><br/><b>(6) the rules aren't too clunky</b><br/>- not too rules heavy, but rules strong on delivering believable fictional directions, fast. Clunky rules give clunky game-play.<br/>- the players using them is ok, if the use of them is done with speed and the transition between immersive state and mechanics-use is smooth. As different states are virtually impossible to avoid, the transitions are key; they need to be as smooth as possible. And in this case that is a quality inherent in the mechanics, or lacking.<br/>- tempo is of the essence when playing! Ideally you should be able to create variations in tempo which mirrors natural tempo of different scenes; action-scenes should be faster than reactive scenes, and dialogue-scenes should vary to reflect the humor of the participants. Clunky rules makes variations in tempo near impossible, and that is a major drawback in all role-playing.<br/><br/><b>(7) players have one character only</b><br/>- identification, subjective point of view, investment and emotional loyalty! All of this helps immersion along.<br/><br/><b>(8) each player character is fleshed out in some detail before play starts, with a strong character concept, including backstories</b><br/>- No! Please; no!<br/>- each character should be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a sketch that offers many pathways to explore</span>. Personality and character-details should be evolved during play, in liege with the fiction. The sketch needs to be given an intentional fleshing-out that suits the fiction and the developments of the character in the fiction. To do that it needs to be an open concept intially, not rigid, so it may develop without too much preconceived drag. A couple of details is enough to start with.<br/>- When the character starts having in-game experiences, sharing them with the player, it will start to become a living thing, in the mind and body of the player. That is where the true character is built; in actual game-play. That is where the true details of a character are created; a personality no player will ever forget; because he/she shares the experiences that led to the details.<br/><br/>More to come ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392113/#Comment_392113" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T12:19:22+00:00" title="October  2, 2012 12:19PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">@TomasHVM</a><br/><br/>- your first point about narrative authority - sure, but I was talking about the "central case"... how can I explain it better...</blockquote>You don't have to.

It makes more sense for trad games like Ars Magica where you have to make decisions for multiple characters. Each individual decision may be a normal character decision, but overall you have a different experience because you have to take many different character points-of-view into consideration.  Or in narration-passing games like Primetime Adventures where you have to decide on consequences to character decisions as well as character decisions.  It doesn't somehow make the roleplaying/character decisions different.  Those happen at a different level than "stance", or as I prefer to call it, approach.  <br/><br/>Similarly, someone who doesn't give a shit about story in games can still be roleplaying while they explore to find out what happens, or maneuver for tactical supremacy, or hang out and chill with their friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392129/#Comment_392129" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T13:57:47+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  1:57PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your list is a bit off.

By a "story-focused" approach  to RPGs, you would seem to mean playing RPGs with an interest in the values, desires and goals of the characters, exploring their personalities, exploring character development etc., rather than physically investigating the wider game-world or seeking out challenge/power or socialising in the real world. That, to me, is not a "story-focused" approach, but simply part of a holistic approach to play, where you are interested in all sorts of interesting facets of the game-world and the characters, and not simply physical investigation, challenge/power or socialising in the real world. These things, which you seem to view as story-focused, are to me integral to many kinds of enjoyable trad roleplay. I do not view them as necessarily "story-focused". I can see that in a loose sense, a game which takes this holistic approach will tend to seem a damn sight more story-like in its outcomes than one where only combat, or only physical exploration, or only the real-world cheetos matter. But to me it is just a holistic approach to roleplay, and not really necessarily a story focus.<br/><br/>Let me explain. People who enjoy this sort of thing may not actually care how the "story" resolves, or even whether it resolves. It is not the destination, but the journey which interests them. Furthermore, they may not see themselves as creating a story, but simply as exploring the game-world. They are exploring the game-world in a holistic way, which is just a fancy way of saying "with a broad perspective", and not with a narrow perspective limited to physical exploration or combat. Their character is, after all, a part of the game-world, and they are exploring their character's personality and the personalities of other characters as well as and together with other aspects of the game-world. This is just a natural part of roleplay if you don't limit yourself artificially to a particular perspective, which is by no means to imply that "limiting" yourself to a "particular perspective" is necessarily a bad thing or not as fun as a "broader" perspective - some of my most enjoyable roleplaying experiences have been in obscenely combat-heavy LARP.<br/><br/>Suppose you're roleplaying your character and two choices are plausible - rescue the princess, or join forces with her abductor. Your character would probably be more likely to rescue her, but you realise that if you join forces with her abductor there is the potential for a story to develop of human tragedy and fall from grace, and the possibility that your character could later fall in love with the princess and seek to undo all his evil acts up to that point. In that instant you can choose to *bend* (not obliterate) the natural quality of your character-decision-making to accommodate what you see as the story-potential you have spotted in a slightly unexpected move. The fact that in making that decision you had one eye on the broader potential of the *story* means that you were in "Author Stance" and you were roleplaying by means of out-of-character thinking.<br/><br/>To put it another way, if you roleplay fully naturally (not just in the sense that it *looks* natural to the outside observer, but in the sense that all your decisions are based on in-character thinking), and are interested in character development and your character's personality and allow them to happen naturally without consciously and deliberately making avenues for them, that's just part of the basic essence of trad roleplay approached with a broad perspective. Only by deliberately adopting a narrow perspective and shutting down opportunities for that kind of exploration can you avoid it.<br/><br/>If on the other hand you roleplay in a way which outwardly seems natural but which is based on the out-of-character thinking inherent in deliberately and consciously choosing paths on the basis that they will expose opportunities for character development, that's going beyond purely trad roleplay into a slightly different realm, and that's what I think of as a story-focused approach to games of the RPG/storygame variety.<br/><br/>This is the difference between us:- ultimately, one of use of language.<br/><br/>As for your question "Does Charles Foster Kane put his new wife on the opera stage because it makes a good story or because of his values, desires, and situation?"... "Values, desires and situation" would be considered in purely natural roleplay (inwardly as well as outwardly natural). But things which could make it "make a good story" could be not the values, desires and situation CFK currently has, but the values, desires and situation that the decision might expose in future, and the dramatic opportunities it might open up.<br/><br/>In a way, what you are expressing is your own subjective view that the best story is one based almost entirely on what would naturally happen. That's a subjective view I'm inclined to share to a very great extent, perhaps entirely; where we differ in substance (rather than in language usage) is, it would seem, merely that it's my assessment that a substantial portion of gamers give rather more weight in that equation to other factors, such as which choice will give more opportunities to test CFK's commitment to his beliefs in future. <br/><br/>[This started off with me borrowing someone else's example but I've kind of made it my own...] what happens if the interesting story-components of the game-setting thus far on the table are questions to do with one particular player character's personality and relationships with the other player characters, in a tense situation under the stress of battle? What if, then, the love of that character's life is about to be slain, and the *only* way to try to keep her alive is for the central PC to sacrifice himself? Perhaps he's always been a little cowardly so a decision that he stays hidden is plausible, but at the same time he loves her so much that the clear natural choice for him would be to save her, but if he does, suddenly you're left with a blank story-slate again. If you approach this purely in an in-character way, he's going to jump out and get killed, perhaps managing to save her in the process, and then - end of story. If you approach it with an eye on the greater needs of the story, arguably you'll pull the cowardice card and stay hidden. But you don't have to pull that card to be storygaming, you just have to be willing to consider it and to feel that considering it is an integral part of what you're doing as a player. At that point, you're storygaming.<br/><br/>I can see room for a gaming style where all decisions that your character makes are made from an in-character perspective and you make other decisions, for instance about the intervention of the Fates on your behalf or for setting the stakes for a conflict, from an out-of-character perspective. I guess to the extent that those decisions about things out of your character's control are made with a view to story, you're storygaming. But the rest of the time, while you're just making in-character decisions in an in-character way, you're surely just roleplaying. I mean, call it storygaming if you want, but why wouldn't trad roleplay encompass exactly that activity? Why do you think of it as something new or different to trad roleplay?<br/><br/>I'm willing to revise my view of this if it's demonstrated that it's wrong, by the way. Partly it's a question of language usage which is very subjective anyway.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392137/#Comment_392137" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T14:48:05+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  2:48PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2012 2:48PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/omnifray">@omnifray</a>: The way you work character sounds fine to me. Others may do what they like, of course. I'm only nazi about these things in my own games, and there we have an initial detail-niveau similar to what you describe. <br/><br/>Further points on omnifrays list:<br/><br/><b>(9) (ed) social conflict mechanics if they exist at all are designed so as not to interrupt freeform dialogue nor constrain how players roleplay</b><br/>- an interesting point ...<br/>- in-character dialogue is a motor for character-identification, the exploration of relationships, and ultimately; immersion. It is at the core of role-playing. Players should be supported in any endeavors to make IC-dialogue.<br/>- mechanics can be in the way of this. A social mechanic is doubly in danger of being in the way; as it deals directly with the arena where the <i>dialogue</i> is meant to thrive. So; any tool which is meant to influence in-character dialogue must be designed with care.<br/>- but supporting dialogue can be good for a game, and it may be done in many different ways. Constrictions may help players realize the predicament of their characters, and inspire them to include new qualities in their interplay, so that may be to good too. <br/>- my advice to designers is to help feed the dialogue, make constructive constraints, and avoid cutting up the scenes where characters talk. <br/><br/><b>(10) there are no personality mechanics or none that the players *have* to be aware of or think about</b><br/>- ok, no mechanics<br/>- but the <i>dialogue-tools</i> of a leader are very much suited to help players "get the feel" of their characters in challenging situations; it may be done with efficiency, without any fuss; so as to help players without breaking immersion<br/>- most humans are subjected to "automated" emotional responses during a week, and most of those are recognizable from individual to individual; stress, shock, anger, sorrow, joy, love ... these may be helped on by a leader, in how he use his voice, gestures and physical positioning towards the players<br/><br/><b>(11) there is no out-of-character banter going on</b><br/>- well, sometimes we enjoy a little bantering, and sometimes we stay in the fiction throughout the game<br/>- it depends on the qualities of the fiction; comedies and tragedies may be treated differently in relation to bantering<br/><br/><b>(12) the playing space is free of distractions</b><br/>- important; tidy up, close the door, neutral background to leader (and players, if possible)<br/>- players concentrating on scenes where their characters are not present; reduce down-time in updating distracted players<br/><br/><b>(13) the GM skilfully uses the right sorts of descriptive approach, expressions, posture etc. to foster immersion</b><br/>- as said in #10; use dialogue-tools; a method is not only mechanics; the dialogue-tools is of much greater importance, even though you find little about them in a traditional rpg<br/><br/><b>(14) everyone knows enough about the game-world to roleplay consistently with it</b><br/>- or they are slowly sinking into it, as they dive into their characters <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392138/#Comment_392138" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T14:52:44+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  2:52PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell us about "dialogue tools"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392145/#Comment_392145" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T15:41:19+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  3:41PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2012 3:50PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well ...<br/>- I've developed my own set of terms to support my design. <br/>- I design both <i>classical</i> (leader+players) and <i>modern</i> (players only) role-playing games. <br/>- My games all have a <i>method</i>. That is; the means by which you are supposed to set-up and play the game.<br/>- Central to most of my methods are the<i> dialogue-tools</i>. That is; the way players/leaders are instructed to act in the game; the initial rites, the formal movements of the game, the use of voice, eyes, gestures, body, manners, touch, positioning, etc. For a leader it may be said to be "how you play the dynamics of the group". For players it may be said to be; "how you give your trust to others, and how you stand by them".<br/>- <i>Mechanics</i> is mostly subservient to the dialogue-tools in my methods. That is; mechanics never stand alone, outside the dialogue-tools; but the dialogue-tools often manage without mechanics. Still; mechanics are useful. They provide a simple way to tip the scales in a conflict, or they produce consequences, or they "feed" a scene with a new direction.<br/><br/>And then I have a theoretical model too, to help organize my thoughts ...<br/>- <b>Vision</b>; what the game is meant to be; the idea/theme/conflict(s) the designer tries to bring forth<br/>- <b>Interaction</b>; the actual playing of the game; this is where any method (and dialogue-tools) are active<br/>- <b>Fiction</b>; the product; what we take away from the table in the form of narrative, intellectual and emotional content<br/><br/>It is a simple model, but it is sufficient. It has helped me a lot, in understanding this newborn art-form.<br/><br/>I hope that clarifies my "dialogue-tools" a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392148/#Comment_392148" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T16:03:10+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  4:03PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are these games you design publicly available, such that a person could download or purchase a simple example of your methodology in practice?<br/><br/>It's rather easier to understand these things in a concrete rather than abstract form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392150/#Comment_392150" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T17:01:04+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  5:01PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>These things, which you seem to view as story-focused, are to me integral to many kinds of enjoyable trad roleplay. I do not view them as necessarily "story-focused".</blockquote>\nNeither do I!  Remember, I'm the guy that says that "trad gaming" is a malformed category and "story-focused" gaming really only matters to how a player approaches a game, not really to categorizing games themselves.  I'm completely cool with someone saying that someone who is playing for the story is "trad gaming".\n<blockquote>Let me explain. People who enjoy this sort of thing may not actually care how the "story" resolves, or even whether it resolves. It is not the destination, but the journey which interests them.</blockquote>\nIf you're going to try to convince me that in order to be story-gaming someone has to be interested in the story "resolving" in the sense that the character reaches some destination-like endpoint, that's a really bold statement, and I'd have hard time saying that the vast majority of stories in human history didn't have an ending, and I'd probably end up hiding behind comic books and soap operas and yelping weak arguments helplessly...<br/><br/>...but <i>you'd</i> then end up with the idea that a huge amount of Primetime Adventures, Universalis, Don't Rest Your Head, FATE,  Dogs in the Vineyard, In A Wicked Age, and Smallville play isn't story-oriented at all because there's no particular need to get to a "destination"...if you're okay with that, give me a sec to get loaded up on Passions episode guides and download some Spiderman annuals because I don't know that I'm gonna win this one.\n<blockquote> Furthermore, they may not see themselves as creating a story, but simply as exploring the game-world.</blockquote>\nYeah, nothing I said indicates that other people can't do the same thing my wife is doing for a completely different reason.  Of course they can, roleplaying can be put to many purposes.\n<blockquote>Suppose you're roleplaying your character and two choices are plausible - rescue the princess, or join forces with her abductor. Your character would probably be more likely to rescue her, but you realise that if you join forces with her abductor there is the potential for a story to develop of human tragedy and fall from grace, and the possibility that your character could later fall in love with the princess and seek to undo all his evil acts up to that point. In that instant you can choose to *bend* (not obliterate) the natural quality of your character-decision-making to accommodate what you see as the story-potential you have spotted in a slightly unexpected move. </blockquote>\nSo what you're saying is that IF there is more than one thing my character MIGHT do based on their personality, drives, goals, situation, etc., and I pick the one that I think would be most interesting, then I'm story gaming, but if I don't spot a second option, or don't really think my character would do those other things, I'm not?  That doesn't seem right. It makes my priorities change depending on how bright I am or whether I'm drunk at the time.\n<blockquote>If on the other hand you roleplay in a way which outwardly seems natural but which is based on the out-of-character thinking inherent in deliberately and consciously choosing paths on the basis that they will expose opportunities for character development, that's going beyond purely trad roleplay into a slightly different realm, and that's what I think of as a story-focused approach to games of the RPG/storygame variety.</blockquote>\nBut that's anti-story. That's death to story because it betrays the character decision -&gt; consequence chain that is the center of virtually all story.  <br/><br/>Now, if what you're saying is that IN ADDITION TO making character decisions, some games also allow (Fiasco) or require (Primetime Adventures) you to handle consequences of character decisions, I agree with you, and that's a viable distinction, but it doesn't divide story approaches from non-story-approaches.\n<blockquote>I can see room for a gaming style where all decisions that your character makes are made from an in-character perspective and you make other decisions, for instance about the intervention of the Fates on your behalf or for setting the stakes for a conflict, from an out-of-character perspective. I guess to the extent that those decisions about things out of your character's control are made with a view to story, you're storygaming.

Why do you think of it as something new or different to trad roleplay?<br/></blockquote>\nI absolutely don't think it's new or different from "trad roleplay", I think roleplaying for the story has been a part of roleplaying since (almost) the very, very beginning. Remember, I'm the guy saying that the distinctions don't add up to anything and most big categories of roleplaying-related things are crummy because we don't have a ton of data.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392158/#Comment_392158" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T21:14:36+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  9:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are you referring to Moreno Psychodrama?

That is the only third person statements I have experienced.<br/><br/>Also there is a very strict guideline to beginning and ending sessions, where you clearly identify objects and people for what they are. i.e. ""[object-held] is no longer [person-name] it is just a [object-held]."" etc.<br/><br/>I do not know if there is any movement in Moreno Psychodrama, again it sounds more like Sociodrama.<br/><br/>If you follow Moreno's guidelines it is pretty easy to facilitate, weather the person you are trying to counsel with therapy participates is another thing though.<br/><br/>And *always* follow the established protocol of beginning and ending a session, it is just as important as the actions taken during the therapy session.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392172/#Comment_392172" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T01:30:32+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  1:30AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are these games you design publicly available ...</blockquote>Planning to get an anthology out there soon, with my English games.

I was paraphrasing something Edwards said in an interview once I think.<br/><br/>As for this:-\n<blockquote>So what you're saying is that IF there is more than one thing my character MIGHT do based on their personality, drives, goals, situation, etc., and I pick the one that I think would be most interesting, then I'm story gaming, but if I don't spot a second option, or don't really think my character would do those other things, I'm not?

You won't be consciously analysing how your character would behave. You'll simply decide in the same way your character would. In the central case of immersive roleplay at any rate, if not universally. This is not a question of inebriation or stupidity, but simply of attitude and preferred mode of thinking.<br/><br/>You seem to swing from saying that if you don't spot a second option then you're stupid or drunk to saying that if you do spot a second option (not founded entirely on what your character's natural thought processes emulated in your mind lead to) then that's anti-story and death of story, so I'm finding what you say a little hard to follow. The point is that if you're immersed, you're not interested in analysing the options. You just get on with being your character, instinctually. Even agonising over what to do is done fully via your character's mindset and with no concern for what may make a better story nor even by consciously analysing what your character would naturally do, but simply by adopting your character's mindset and then making the decision AS your character. [Edited to add:- I am talking about the central case of immersion in character here, and not necessarily about all immersion in character in a universal sense.]<br/><br/>For me, of course, it's the very possibility of immersion which makes the distinction between trad gaming and story gaming interesting, though by no means all trad gaming is immersive and by no means all story gaming is as counter immersive as some particularly counter immersive trad gaming, speaking for me personally and probably a significant proportion of gamers but not everyone. I can imagine a preference for active use of one's creative imagination and collaborative creativeness making storygames more interesting than trad games to a proportion of gamers too (and for me that's a very distinct preference from the preference for immersion), though for me personally it's immersion all the way.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392185/#Comment_392185" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T04:12:53+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  4:12AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Are these games you design publicly available ...</blockquote>Planning to get an anthology out there soon, with my English games.

And playing 15 minutes (that's the definition of a <i>role-playing poem</i>) of boredom is quite interesting, especially as you may get more than bored in that time; you get to adopt the body and soul of an unimaginative human being; feeling heavy and doused, and lacking completely in initiative. <br/><br/>A strong and strange experience. It certainly peeked my sense of wonder when we did it the first time. We are, after all, talking about just 15 minutes of play!<br/><br/>Another simple example of my use of <i>dialogue-tools</i> in role-playing games, can be found on this forum; <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17182/10-minutes-challenge-dark-game#Item_50" rel="nofollow">The Life or Death act of 2021</a>. It make use of a quite simple trick; the one player in the role of the criminal must stand, while the other players (the jury), sit and interview him. Standing alone before a seated group makes you vulnerable, and that is exactly how a criminal would feel, standing before a jury begging for his life. Such positioning inspires the dialogue. It manifest status-differences in our relationships, and triggers automatic responses in our brain and body (our "animal soul" responding to an uncomfortable situation).

I'm glad you've just plain laid this out here. You've got a preference. You've spoken about why you like this style of play best, and you've nailed downthe possibility that other types of play appeal to folks and you're okay with that and can at least understand it a bit even if you don't prefer it.<br/><br/>That's pretty much how I feel about immersion, except in reverse. I mean, not always, somethinmes i really love immersion, but it's a side choice for me, not the main thing I go looking for.<br/><br/>But you're right. Lots of folks love that style of play.<br/><br/>Here are my questions , and I hope they are better answered collectively around places like this:<br/><br/><i>What approaches to supporting that kind of fun can be officialized or mechanized, to at least get people off on the right foot to supporting this kind of fun?<br/><br/>Do trad mechanics really support this stuff, or are we simply accepting of them because that's always what we've had to work with?<br/><br/>Are there better possibilities?<br/><br/>What are the things that are easy for a GM in this support mode to do? What things make it harder? Can we drop some of those and focus on different stuff?<br/><br/>What is a realistic amount of prep and in play activity for a GM to cover to support this sort of play? When does that become burdensome or undesirable?<br/><br/>With this kind of fun as a goal, what can we expect players to do to support not just their own fun, but the fun of the whole group? What can they do to support the GM's fun and the feeling of realness of the setting? What things are obvious pitfalls/problems that trad gaming set ups run into in supporting this kind of play?</i><br/><br/>See, I tend to think that not enough real though has been covered with regard to supporting immersive play, and that it could benefit from a new look at it. I honestly believe that supporting this type of fun could be made vastly easier. When I think of this type of play and my own negative experiences with it,most of them have to do with a higher burden on the GM than I wish to assume as a GM.<br/><br/>So help me out. My own negative experiences can be summed up as follows:<br/><br/>Player expectation that I'll learn a whole bigass rule system and setting, know how it all works, but they won't ever bexpected to do the same. Instead, I get to act as the complete book of knowledge and mechanics in human form, and also GM at the table. I don't want all of that. I'd rather just wing everything at that point, but this has been unacceptable to playersi've encountered.<br/><br/>Low commitment to outside activity related to play from the player end. Folks want to have the fun of character immersive play, but never wish to give direct, out of character hooks to the GM. Not during play ( which I understand), but not between play either.<br/><br/>Lots of passive characters. They're in an adventure game, they're made up as action characters, they constantly avoid adventure. hen adventure comes calling at their door, they run away and hide from it, then get bored that nothing is happening.<br/><br/>Poor connectivty between characters, even when connectivity is emphasized before the start of the game, leading to some of the above. Seiously, characters vastly less connected socially in-fiction that the players playing the characters.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's really my beef with immersion. Not that I think it's horrible inherently ( I don't !!), but rather frustrations I've had trying to run for immersives with trad games. And honestly, I'm thinking of failed attempts to run an old Vampire the Masquerade game on three different occasions.<br/><br/>(Although I do tend to think those qualities work okay in a Vamp LARP. The same players were fine going week after week and just kinda being their characters. No big adventures, no real changes. Just kinda hanging out at the vampire bar socializing as their characters. That's what i call Magic Tea Party play)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392195/#Comment_392195" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T07:20:17+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  7:20AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a><br/><br/>I summary, I think your issues with character immersion are:<br/><br/>The time is takes to learn the system and setting, and expectation that it's you who does this<br/>Players not wishing to give out of character hooks to the GM out of character.<br/>Passive characters<br/>Poorly connected characters<br/><br/>I'd argue that with the possible exception of the first none of these are problems relating directly games which support character immersion, but nonetheless, I'll address them.<br/><br/>The first. Choose a light system you know or can master quickly. There are plenty of those. It's your players' job to know how their characters interact with the system. Character immersion doesn't mean a complex system at all. Then, choose a setting you know, or one everyone is already familiar with. For example, the real world in your city today.<br/><br/>The second one: During character creation you ask them to create a character who is driven to do whatever the game's primiary activity is. Then, you ask them what their characters would want to do.  Then you put that in front of them. Reward active play with in-game currency. <br/><br/>The third; have them create all their characters together and have them be part of a group which does things your fiction encourages. Ask them why they are the sort of characters who hang out together and don't kill each other. It's only during character creation where they will be explicitly, as people not immersing in character and it's your chance to put the onus on them to tell you why they are a team. <br/><br/>Many of these forms of behaviour are actually far more problematic in games with distributed GM authority. Try playing Fiasco with someone who is passive, unengaged or doesn't want to contribute to the fiction. I agree that trad games are harder to run, but they are usually a lot easier to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392196/#Comment_392196" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T07:29:51+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  7:29AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The point is that if you're totally in character (internally as well as externally) you won't be paying attention to or looking for a "second option".

You can't immerse in a character who sees several different ways to act and tries to decide among them? Now I'm totally confused.   Isn't the whole point of immersion to decide as your character would decide in that situation? If your character sees many possibilities and tries to decide between them based on their feelings, values, and situation, are you saying that cannot be immersion because I should "just know" which one it would be? Do you always "just know" what decision you're going to make, or do you sometimes think about your decisions?\n<blockquote>For me, of course, it's the very possibility of immersion which makes the distinction between trad gaming and story gaming interesting, though by no means all trad gaming is immersive and by no means all story gaming is as counter immersive as some particularly counter immersive trad gaming, speaking for me personally and probably a significant proportion of gamers but not everyone.

Well, in that case, exactly 50 percent of story-gaming is immersive and exactly 50 percent of trad gaming is non-immersive.  I have as much reliable data to back up my percentages as you do.<br/><br/>I mean, you're really trying here, and I get that, but there's plenty of people who howl at LARP-ers that they can never, ever be truly immersed, and accusing 4eD&amp;D players of trying to destroy all immersion in the hobby, so I kind of think you've got an uphill battle to reclaim the jargon from the way gamers have flat ruined it. The "indie RPG" guys made a concerted effort over many years to make people think "indie" meant "creator owned" and maybe got 40-50 percent of gamers to buy into that? Most people think "indie" means GM-less these days, which is a giant fail.  Right now, to gamers, immersion is "what I do" and inferior non-immersive games are what <i>you</i> play, especially those filthy, disgusting, awful STORY games?!?!?  So I've gotta return to my original post and wish you luck in storming the castle.

The point is that you are seeing them as the character from the inside, not as the player from the outside. You go through the alternatives purely by the scheme of the character's reasoning process, and you arrive at the character's natural conclusion. That eliminates all alternatives. You never have to apply a second layer of thinking to determine which of the possible natural conclusions to prefer - the character's natural reasoning process gets you there. Caveat:- this is the central case of immersive roleplay, but not necessarily the only way.<br/><br/>Regarding the percentages, I cite my poll at the start of this thread as evidence that there are SOME common tendencies among immersive gamers, though they are by no means universal. And it's only common sense that that should be so, too.<br/><br/>I've never in all my gaming life among LARPers and tabletoppers alike ever heard <i>anyone</i> suggest that no gamer can be truly immersed in LARP. What a preposterous idea! As for D&amp;D 4e players setting out to destroy immersion, obviously that's not an accurate or fair representation, though I can understand why the heavy emphasis on grinding combat and kewl powerz and the dissociated mechanics all of which some people (including myself) subjectively perceive to be the focus of D&amp;D 4e [without so much as having played a single game of it I hasten to add, so I'm no authority on the matter] may lead some hardcore pro-immersion gamers to take a dim view of 4e. Mostly though they do it by comparing it to WoW or a boardgame, rather than specifically by talking about immersion. Discourse specifically about immersion is IMHO YMMV only a very small part of the picture of the general discourse of attacks on 4e. Edited to add:- just as discourse on narrativism is only a small part of the picture of attacks on White Wolf games. Saying that immersion is invalid as a concept because it's used to attack 4e is as far off the mark as suggesting that narrativism is a worthless idea because it's used to attack Mark Rein-Hagen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392219/#Comment_392219" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T09:22:16+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  9:22AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2012 9:24AM by TildeSee.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (nevermind, realised that I'd missed exactly this point being raised.

href="/forums/profile/KomradeBob">@KomradeBob</a>, I agree with Simon_Rogers on this. Your problem is the players, and maybe the poor fit between yourself and the particular trad systems you've used, not the trad/immersive concept itself. Use a rules-light system and stick to territory that inspires you. You could do a hack of your favourite storygame set-up rules as part of CharGen, e.g. taken from Fiasco, to ensure the characters enter play with something that merits a relationship map. Use a setting you already know well, maybe one you made up yourself and make sure the basics are available to the players in-character.<br/><br/>Edited to add:- <b>Dead of Night</b> can be marvellous for immersion. Try that to get the hang of it before you venture into tradder territory.<br/><br/>One thing to be careful of. <b>By no means all trad players "get" immersion</b>. Some may be playing for the challenge, effectively wargaming, or they may be playing a game of world-exploration with no character-focus, approaching it in a simulation-oriented mindset but without actually having a concept of (nor experience of) immersion. Others may be social gamers, or yet other alternatives. If you've got trad players who aren't immersive gamers, I'm not really the person to ask on what to do with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392223/#Comment_392223" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T09:28:59+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  9:28AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(nevermind, realised that I'd missed exactly this point being raised.

You just keep on with your in-character reasoning about the arguments for or against each alternative according to the character's internal perspectives and something is bound to tip the scales. <br/><br/>Just as with a real person, you always end up making a decision.<br/><br/>And sometimes the result may be that the character is indecisive and agonises for a long time. If that impacts on other characters, no doubt they will intervene to try to speed up the decision-maker's reasoning process.

How often have you utterly failed to reach a decision?<br/><br/>Even when you utterly fail to reach a decision, that's only because you stopped trying to decide and moved on to something else.<br/><br/>It's never going to be literally impossible to reach a decision wholly by in-character reasoning, or if it is, the character moves on to something else and doesn't make a decision unless another character or setting element forces one upon them. And that's fine!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392234/#Comment_392234" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T10:28:02+00:00" title="October  3, 2012 10:28AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Narrativism is a worthless idea for many other reasons, true, but among them absolutely is that the essays defining it had moronic ideas about what White Wolf gameplay was like and showed they had no clue about what was going on.  <br/><br/>Believe me, if you don't think LARPers weren't routinely derided for not playing immersively, you weren't on the same Usenet discussions I was in the 90s.
