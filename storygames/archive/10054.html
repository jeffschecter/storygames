Recently, however, I've decided that I'd like to try my hand at designing such a system for one of my smaller projects with the intent to see how it affects the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What I don't need...</b><br/>\nInquires as to how this system fits into the game, just know that it does and have faith in me. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>\nDoubt regarding the necessity of including something like this in any game whatsoever.<br/>\n<b><br/>\nWhat I do need...</b><br/>\nConstructive criticism on the mechanics presented.<br/>\nSuggestions on terminology. Specifically regarding the list of Traits at the bottom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><span style="color:#FF00FF">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></b><br/>\n[align=center]<span style="color:#0000CC">The Mechanics</span><br/>\n[/align]<b><span style="color:#FF00FF">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Creation:</b> Distribute the following values amongst your Traits; +3, +2, +1, +1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -2, -3. With your GM\u2019s permission, you may apply more negatives but you must balance it with an equal number of positives.<br/>\n<b>Setup:</b> Whenever your character's reaction to an event is in question, the GM will call for a Judgment Test. You may then select three Traits, you should choose at least one positive and one negative Trait. The GM will then select one of these Traits based on how what sorts of reactions he suspects should be produced. Situations may come up where the GM deems one Trait, or specific Traits, to be the only applicable choices.<br/>\n<b>Judgment Test:</b> Roll 1d10 and add the Trait\u2019s value to the result. If the result is 6 or higher, your reaction must lean towards the right side (Virtue). If the result is 5 or lower, your reaction must lean towards the left side (Vice). You may refuse to react in the manner that you rolled but doing so accumulates one Stress Token.<br/>\n<b>Stress Tokens:</b> Stress Tokens are removed over time, very slowly. Usually one per week unless the GM deems a situation of great happiness capable of wiping away your stress. For every Stress Token over 4, apply a -1 to all of your Judgment Tests. If you reach 8 Stress Tokens, your character will be so depressed that he may end up committing suicide.<br/>\n(while not noted in this section the game text... Stress Tokens also lower the character's Synchronization Level, which makes it more difficult for him to control machines with his mind)\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>Example:</b> The player\u2019s pilot, Neivann, is searching an abandoned warehouse for his brother. He comes upon a man beating a teenaged boy. The man turns to him as soon as he enters and says, \u201cListen, buddy, you can just forget this happened and take 100 credits for your trouble. Easy money, right?\u201d The GM calls for a Judgment Test, the player chooses Wrath, Greed and Apathy.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>Example One:</b> The GM chooses Wrath. Neivann has a -1, he is prone to violence it seems. The player rolls a single d10 and gets a 6, reduced by 1 to 5. He must react in a violent manner. Neivann, with anger in his eyes, draws his pistol an opens fire with no mercy shooting to kill. On the other hand, if he had scored a 6 or higher, Neivann may have accepted the money and went away, or offered the man money in order to secure the boy\u2019s safety.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>Example Two:</b> The GM chooses Greed. Neivann has a +2, he is not easily swayed by material wealth and is more prone to give than to take. The player rolls and gets a 5, plus 2 is a 7. He must act is a charitable, non-greedy way. Neivann says he will not accept the money, instead he tries to intimidate the thug with the threat of the police. If Neivann had achieved the opposite result, he could have accepted the money and left or asked for more money in order to keep things a secret.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>Example Three:</b> The GM chooses Apathy. Neivann has a +1, he is prone to action and emotional attachment. The player rolls, gets a total of 8. Neivann must act with passion and action! Neivann decides he cannot let an innocent boy be treated like this with no recourse, he pulls free his pistol and fires at the thug\u2019s limbs hoping to take him out with lethal shots. If Neivann had achieved the opposite result, he may have shrugged noting that this has nothing to do with his brother and walked off to avoid further involvement.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<b>Mental Scars:</b> When characters are presented with tragic, frightening, embarrassing or any other emotionally damaging event the GM may apply a Mental Scar to one of your Traits. The Trait chosen is either relevant to the event that caused the damage or  the character\u2019s highest Positive Trait. The next situation that comes up involving that Trait causes the die result to be a 1 automatically. Once that situation is resolved, the Mental Scar is removed. Upon this removal two things occur; the player may decide to decrease that Trait by 1 and increase a different Trait of his choice by 1 and he must roll a d10. If the result is equal to or lower than the number of Stress Tokens his character currently has, he gains another Stress Token.<br/>\n[align=center]<br/>\n<img alt="jb4wm0.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i26.tinypic.com/jb4wm0.jpg"/>[/align]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223627/#Comment_223627" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T07:02:38+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  7:02AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2009 7:08AM by MacLeod.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not about to let this thread die without a fight. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>\nI've gotten a tremendous amount of replies over at the forge so I thought I'd post a slightly updated version of what I have written thus far.<br/>\nIf anyone has any comments, criticisms or questions... feel free to reply. I'd like to tighten up this system as much as possible before actually using it.<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]<span style="color:#CC3333">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>[/align]<br/>\n[align=center]Traits[/align]<br/>\n[align=center]<span style="color:#0000FF">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>[/align]<br/>\n[align=center]Traits represent your character\u2019s propensity towards certain actions with particular themes.[/align]<br/>\n[align=center]Trait List[/align]<br/>\n[align=center]<img alt="eg7czn.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i28.tinypic.com/eg7czn.jpg"/>[/align]<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Setup:</b> Whenever your character\u2019s reaction to an event is in question, the GM may call for a Judgment [1] + Trait Test. You must select three Traits, you should choose at least one Positive and one Negative Trait. Keep in mind when selecting Traits; how do you want your character to react and how do you think your character would react? Also, try to select Traits that relate to the event at hand. Conscious attempts to utilize Traits which do not apply may result in the GM choosing a Trait of his own accord.<br/>\nThe GM will then select one of these Traits based on what reaction he suspects should be produced. This assumption can be based on any criteria that pleases the GM. Situations may come up where the GM deems one Trait, or specific set of Traits, to be the only applicable choices. It is completely acceptable for the GM to select a number of Traits and then allow the player to select the Trait to be used. However, this should indicate a great amount of trust between the GM and the player. Another alternate, and very arbitrary, method to choosing a Trait is rolling 1d10 and counting from the top down.<br/>\n<b>Judgment Test:</b> Roll for the Test. If the result is 6 or higher, your character\u2019s reaction must lean towards the right side (Virtue). If the result is 5 or lower, your character\u2019s reaction must lean towards the left side (Vice). Regardless of whether the result is Vice or Virtue, you must incorporate it into your reaction description. The GM will decide whether or not the reaction you have described is appropriate or not. If you willingly ignore the result of the Judgment Test, the GM may give you a Stress Token.<br/>\n<b>Stress Tokens:</b> You may refuse to react in the manner that you rolled but doing so accumulates one Stress Token. Stress Tokens are removed over time, very slowly. Usually one token may be removed per week unless the GM deems a situation of true happiness capable of washing your stress away. For every Stress Token over 4, apply a -1 to all of your Judgment Tests. If you reach 8 Stress Tokens, your character will become so depressed that he may end up committing suicide or collapsing and developing a psychological disorder.<br/>\n<b>Mental Scars:</b> When PCs are presented with tragic, frightening, embarrassing or any other emotionally damaging event the GM may apply a Mental Scar to one of his Traits. The Trait chosen is either relevant to the event that caused the damage or  the PC\u2019s highest Positive Trait. The next situation that comes up involving that Trait causes the die result to be a 1 automatically. Once that situation is resolved, the Mental Scar is removed. Upon the Mental Scar\u2019s removal, the player must roll 1d10. If the result is equal to or lower than the PC\u2019s current Stress Token amount, he gains one Stress Token. The removal of a Mental Scar also allows the player to decide whether or not to decrease the previously affected Trait by 1 and increase a different Trait of his choice by 1.<br/>\n<b>Inspiration:</b> When PCs are presented with an event so pure in morality and goodness the GM may place an Inspiration on one of your Traits. Inspirations work very similarly to Mental Scars though in context they are the complete opposite. The Trait chosen is either relevant to the event that caused the inspiration or the PC\u2019s worst Negative Trait. The next situation that comes up involving that Trait causes the die result to be a 10 automatically. Once that situation is resolved, the Inspiration is removed. Upon the Inspiration\u2019s removal, the player must roll 1d10. If the result is equal to or lower than the PC\u2019s current Stress Token amount, he loses one Stress Token. The removal of an Inspiration also allows the player to decide whether or not to increase the previously affected Trait by 1 and decrease a different Trait of his choice by 1.\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>Example:</b> The player\u2019s pilot, Neivann, is searching an abandoned warehouse for his brother.

So, I know for a fact that the problem doesn't lie in the presentation of the mechanics. If no one has anything to say, then that is fine... The mechanic is ready for playtesting at this point anyways. I just want reactions, observations, comments, questions and suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer some of those traditional questions... The rest of the game that this subsystem is involved with is, for the most part, on a different scale. Meaning while the Traits System adds depth, it enhances a part of the game that is secondary. The Traits System is meant to tie in with the rest of the game through Stress Tokens. Stress Tokens reduce a character's Synchronization. Synchro allows characters to better control the machines they operate. It is arguably the important limited resource each character has access to. While this is important to the overall game, I don't feel that this information is important to the subsystem. It could very well operate without the additional complication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I make duplicate threads is to do my best to gather as many suggestions as possible. My last thread required a little push to get going but in the end it did for me a lot more than the Forge did. So in the end, I think it pays to try. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Valamir[/cite]Why do the choose 3 and then the GM chooses 1 of them dance?<br/>\nIf you're choosing based on what your character would do, and then the GM is choosing based on what he thinks your character would do...why the extra steps?

The GM ultimately has the final decision because he is an impartial entity whereas the player has stock in his own character.<br/>\nTo allow the player to choose the trait would be relatively close to simply roleplaying. That said, such an approach would work just fine as long as their is a good deal of trust between the GM and the player. If the player is an optimizer who thinks every situation has a 'Win' condition, chances are he will ignore personality and choose whatever he thinks will benefit him the most.

I already include visible alternates. I also had a suggestion over at the Forge that included using cards to select the Trait to be rolled for.

That came out kinda dickish.  My apologies.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you're operating from a set of assumptions that are rather difficult to engage with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a for instance, your statement that no RPGs can solve the problem of a non impartial GM really is just not true.  There's lots of RPGs which have GMs for which "being impartial" isn't even really part of the job description.  Because the game design has moved so far beyond worrying about who might be cheating and who might be weaseling their way through the rule book that its just not something the GM needs to be concerned with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs another you say above "as long as there is a good bit of trust between the GM and the players".  I always start with that assumption as a given.  Why would I ever play with a group I don't trust to play well?  Are you attempting to design a game that will allow you to force players to play a certain way because you can't trust them to just play that way because they want to?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention above that there's a lack of players injecting colorful personality to their characters at your table.  Is this something they want to do but just don't know how?  Are you designing a set of training wheel mechanics to help instill in them the habit of playing with personality...the way Wu Shu is essentially a training wheel mechanic designed to get players in the habit of adding colorful descriptions to their actions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no such thing as good or bad personality  mechanics.  There is only whether or not the mechanics are fulfilling their purpose in actual play.  Without really understanding your purpose for why you want to use these mechanics its really difficult to evaluate whether they are any good or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best I can offer at this point constructively is that having the GM select the Trait that will be rolled and then expecting me to roleplay consistently with that trait smacks a bit of "dance for me monkey" play, which I don't find all that enjoyable.  As a once in a while twist it can be fun, but as a routine part of expected play...no so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I choose the Trait then presumeably its a Trait I want to roleplay out.  If I'm choosing the Trait for some "optimization" reason...then clearly for me that optimization is a bigger source of my fun than roleplaying traits is...so any rule designed to force me to do something I'm not all that interested in doing...isn't likely to work very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I'm the sort of player who needs to be coerced into roleplaying personality...I'm probably not going to like your rules.  If I'm the sort of person that already likes to roleplay personality...then I can probably be trusted to choose my own Trait that I want to roleplay...so I'm probably not going to like your rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an example of non coercive personality mechanics, I recommend checking out Pendragon.  There are some who've used the Pendragon mechanics coercively...they're actually using the system wrong (hugely game breakingly wrong IMO).  As designed the system is merely a map that tracks how a character actually DID behave as opposed to a rule prescribing how they MUST behave.  It also served as a guide for how the GM should have NPCs respond to you.  If I have have a high score in Lust than the GM is likely to have chaste and polite company look down on me and priests rail against me for my sinful nature.  If I have a high score in Bravery than the GM is likely to have my peers praise my courage and my lord select me for dangerous missions because he knows I won't run.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to the carrot of getting NPCs to respond to me the way I'd like them to, the game uses the carrot of Glory to get me to behave consistently.  If I have a high enough reputation for being honest (i.e. a score of 16 or more out of 20 earned after several sessions of behaving honestly ) I will earn Glory.  But being dishonest is now more likely to drop my score then being honest is to increase it, so inconsistent (i.e. honest when its convenient) play will keep my score too low to earn Glory.  At Glory earning levels the GM can use some coersion on me (in the form of forcing a roll before allowing me to lie) but presumeably if I was willing to let my score get that high I am willing to accept that possibility.  If I'm not, its a simple matter to not let my score get that high.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...instead of a "dance for me monkey" mechanic where the GM or a random die roll tells me how I must now perform...consider a mechanic that tracks how I actually do perform over time and use your Stress / Synchro mechanic as a carrot similar to Glory to make me want to perform (i.e. look for opportunities to demonstrate my honesty) and to perform consistently (i.e. struggle to be honest even when its not convenient).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224497/#Comment_224497" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T11:23:12+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 11:23AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Valamir[/cite]But you're operating from a set of assumptions that are rather difficult to engage with.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI think this is a personal problem, sir, given the ease of response I acquired over at the Forge.

If actions are dictated by these propensities and the player controls their values, then they are actually guiding their future reactions to a degree. It is possible for the game to played minus the Traits System but then the only game mechanic with any kind of deep substance becomes the tactical battles (which are only half of the kind of battles that can occur). The rest of the game is meant to be very lite. Every game has its strong and weak points.<br/>\nAs I said before... even though character control leaves the players hands for a moment, it comes back to him as he ultimately decides what a Vice/Virtue <i>means</i> to his character.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">You mention above that there's a lack of players injecting colorful personality to their characters at your table.

There are mechanical effects behind those numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI.e.  exactly what you've stated you wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only difference is that Pendragon encourages players to engage with those mechanics by offering them a reward for doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour set up requires players to engage with your mechanics by hardwiring what they are are expected to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying I don't "like" the mechanics you've presented.  I'm saying I don't think they will actually do what you say you want them to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nESPECIALLY if the situation you're in is people around the table being embarassed to roleplay.  The last thing you want mechanically (or socially for that matter, particularly with people you've just met) is to create rules that essentially say "you're not playing right, you need to play THIS way".  And whether you're trying to or not, that's what rules that say "and now you are required to play your character in a greedy manner...please begin" do.  They say "you can't be trusted to roleplay your character's feelings properly so now I, the GM in combination with these dice are going to tell you what you should do."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't a question of fun / not fun...this is just fundamentally NOT the best way to address the problem you are having.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have people who are reluctant to portray their character's emotional state / mental health a better way is to present them with a menu of options to choose from...like your Traits.  That narrows down the overwhelming feeling of having too many options into something more manageable.  You then want to give them an incentive to actually do the portrayal.  Not a requirement that they must...that doesn't build trust...but an encouragement that they MAY.  You want to draw them out of their shell with your rules...not drag them out by yanking on a leash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224610/#Comment_224610" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T20:06:25+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  8:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way you have described Pendragon's system makes it sound like a near-useless system of tracking past behavior.<br/>\nI could go ahead and repeat myself a hundred times over but I think neither of want to continue wasting the other's time, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'll say a few things...<br/>\nI designed the system to display propensities and to integrate them into the game mechanically. I dispersed control over a few aspects. This is to say that control still stays with the player but they hinge on different decisions than what is standard. Furthermore, the importance of some previously control-related decisions have been increased exponentially. I wanted the system creates solid, obvious reactions rather quickly. In practice it should be fairly quick, especially once a player gets to know his character.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou keep mentioning that it seems like the player has no control over his character's reactions and I have to keep refuting that point. Do you think each Vice/Virtue has black and white reactions belonging to them? Do you think every situation will only one possible reaction associated with each Vice/Virtue? If so, your thoughts are erroneous.<br/>\nI'm sure you are also aware that the primary method of gathering Stress Tokens involves the player saying, "I wish to IGNORE this result so that I can roleplay in a way I'd prefer." Granted, Stress Tokens are bad news but it is the price one pays for ignoring their gut reaction to a situation. The seeds of doubt, what ifs...<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally... I want to say that you may have had a massive negative effect on me if this conversation happened and not the ones on the Forge. However, given the very positive reactions I've garnered there... I'm pretty much a rock as far as the foundation of this system is concerned.<br/>\nI tell ya what, if I playtest it and it turns out to be complete crap... I'll send you a 'Congratulations, you were right' whisper and I'll just scrap the whole idea of roleplaying mechanics. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224621/#Comment_224621" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T22:34:27+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 10:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think there has been a communication error.

However there is mention about that character being a 'PC', which I associate more with the player having a lot more control over the character's reactions. Perhaps you need another term? Or to specify this is intended early on in the text? (this may be something covered in another section of your rules)<br><br>A few queries on the system:<br><br>It seems like the best way for me to create a brave character is not to give them a +3 in the bravery/cowardice scale, but just to not use it in judgement tests. If you do select it, even with a +2 there is a strong chance that (if selected by the GM) the character will respond in a cowardly manner. While this chance of 'failure' may be intended (either to force stress or produce more flawed characters, or both) there doesn't seem to be anything in place to prevent this avoidance tactic. (I guess this creates a 'not cowardly' rather than brave character, but that's a difficult distinction to make for me)<br><br>Following on from that slightly, I'm not sure about how the 'player picks three, GM picks one of those' mechanic would work out in play. There doesn't seem to be anything preventing the player from selecting 3 mostly unrelated to the situation traits that they don't care about, rather than ones which suit better but they want to avoid a certain result on one of the 3. Do you think this would work if it was turned around? The GM selecting 3 traits appropriate to the situation and the player choosing one of those to test against. Your concern mentioned earlier that this would be close to 'simply roleplaying' seems a bit odd to me because, as you have designed it, by selecting that trait they are allowing the possibility of the opposite result to the one they want (at least a 20% chance of, in fact).<br><br>After the resolution of the Judgement test, is the narrated result automatically valid, or does this then flow into other sections of the game system?

I don't want to implement the Traits System only to have it easily ignored... I want players to be aware of it, to know that Stress Tokens are something to be feared.

And plus, when it comes down to it... Roleplaying Mechanics take away control in some way or another. Some just do it in a different way. Take FATE for an example, player control is limited by the requirement Aspects place upon PC behavior in order to gain bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, I explicitly never ever use terms like Storyteller, Storyguide, Director, Extra, Referee, Actor, etc... in my games. Player, Player Character, Non-Player Character and Game Master are mainstays for me. Easy to recognize and they remind folks that they are playing a game.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">It seems like the best way for me to create a brave character is not to give them a +3 in the bravery/cowardice scale, but just to not use it in judgment tests.

One or two Stress Tokens won't break a character so they can afford to ignore Judgment Tests from time to time. In addition, not all reactions are put to the Judgment Test. Much like how folks don't roll for mundane actions (things like walking, tying their shoes), folks are not expected to make Judgment Tests daily for minor things like seeing a commercial they hate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the GM is given the freedom to bypass the rules in order to deal with problem players. That said, GMs ALWAYS have that power because rules are malleable tools in my eyes. It is written into rules that the GM is free to deem a situation suitable for only one specific Trait, or a collection of Traits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, the opportunity for personality deviance exists because folks tend to react differently under different circumstances even if they revolve around the same basic concepts (fear, anger, etc...). I've mentioned many times that the Traits as they are filled out are nothing more than propensities towards certain thematic reactions. And each theme is not a rigid sort of reaction either, more like a generalization. Wrath isn't always violence and it isn't always sudden and obvious. It could even be an oath to exact revenge.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Following on from that slightly, I'm not sure about how the 'player picks three, GM picks one of those' mechanic would work out in play.

But if the player did it unintentionally, the GM would likely try to help him better understand what the Vice/Virtue means to the game... and perhaps try to work out through discussion what the Vice/Virtue may mean to his character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224681/#Comment_224681" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T08:53:39+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  8:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's your dismissive, arrogant tone combined with the walls of text that are killing the response to your thread here.<br><br>p.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224706/#Comment_224706" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T10:49:57+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 10:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2009 10:53AM by MacLeod.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree with the notion that I'm being arrogant. I don't recall claiming that I am superior to anyone and I don't think I have implied as much either. My assumptions are built on planned projections... which I've already stated may not necessarily be the truth in reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts possible that my tone begins to show irritation... but that is because I've repeated myself quite a bit. For instance, I think the idea that player control is sorely lacking in this system is a misconception. Things aren't as rigid as people are seeing them, at least when I look at the system I don't see an overbearing loss of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts hard to imagine that being dismissive would kill a thread.<br/>\nIf I'm not allowed to read a suggestion and say, "No, I don't think that fits what I'm looking for" then we've got some issues above and beyond this thread. You should also note that I haven't been completely dismissive... just largely dismissive. That can happen... ideas from many different people are bound to not gel well at times.<br/>\nFrom that last collection of posts that I replied to, I learned some interesting things that I am going to use to modify the system... So perhaps my persistent, abrasive approach isn't as terrible as you think it is?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I write too much but I figure if I'm going to reply, I think it should be done in the most complete manner that I'm capable of.

I am pretty focused right now on the specific model I have created. I'd rather folks tell me alternate approaches to handling what exists rather than the notion that is should all be torn down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI even pointed out in some instances that the suggestion the person has made is already incorporated...

The other method where the GM chooses then the player chooses is already included as an alternate so it is only a matter of seeing whether or not 3 vs. 2 works. I would probably gather data about preferences at the end of each playtesting session ("Did it bother you that the GM got the final decision on which Trait to use?

The design culture you are coming from is vastly different from mine.  Designers I hang around are generally willing to trash entire core mechanics right up until the release candidate stage if they don't fit what the game is trying to do.<br><br>That leaves the question of what you are trying to do?  You have said several times this is a mechanic for tracking mental health.  Chaosium's Call of Cthuhlu's Sanity Points do that superbly and simply.  There is also a somewhat mushy idea of forcing people to play to their predispositions-- their "alignment" if you will.  Chaosium's Pendragon apparently does a good job at this by using a carrot rather than stick approach.  We're clear up to this point.  I think I echo the consensus with my opinion that a stick approach to predispositions is unlikely produce the reactions you want.<br><br>Here's my advice: stop arguing here, take advice when it's given and play your mechanics before dismissing others as not knowing what you're after.<br><br>I don't know what games you're playing right now, but the rules as presented are modular enough that they could be dropped into most games without swapping the engine, so to speak.  Taking D&amp;D (3,4, whatever) as one possibility: stress tokens give you -1 to vital tasks (to hit, skill checks.)  If the stress tokens are meant to flow more freely, make it -1 per 2 or 3 tokens.  Try it out, see if it produces the results you expect.  Arguing the rules in theory here will not give you a quarter the feedback as trying them out on the fly.  See if the rules make the game at your table better or not; that's the test of the mechanic.<br><br>To reiterate other's advice:<br>Check out Pendragon, as it apparently has a system that you could use for inspiration.  I understand that you are uninterested in the setting because it involves "knights and stuff," but that is no reason to reject the model, which could keep you from reinventing the wheel, and concentrate your efforts on improving it instead.

Well, most of it. It certainly needs playtesting to see what it feels like in play. However, I'm not sure it does a good job of "tracking mental health". What it does do a good job of portraying (though you'd have to playtest to be sure) is painting the picture of characters struggling against themselves. I think that could be done in a simpler way, but it doesn't seem to be your goal, so I won't go into that.<br><br>Anyway, the mechanics seem interesting, and I wouldn't have much of a problem with the selection method presented, as long as I'm in a group with some good social dynamics. If I say "really, I can only see these two Traits being relevant here," I'd expect the GM to say "Yeah, alright, just pick those two. I'll pick this one, as it seems the most interesting to me."<br><br>A lot of people have been burned by asshat GMs and "your character wouldn't do that". I'm not sure, but that might be a reason for some of the negativity. Or they just have different play goals.<br><br>However, I am always a bit annoyed by stuff like "the GM is given the freedom to bypass the rules in order to deal with problem players". What about problem GMs? I'm not comfortable with having the GM have higher status than the players. Of course rules can be bent or broken for the good of the game, but that should be done by the group, not a single person. No matter if the GM is a great guy, or if I'm the GM, I don't like it when the GM role creates a social hierarchy where the GM can deal with "problem players". The group should, in my opinion, dela with "problem players", including the GM.<br><br>Eh, that was a philosophical aside. Don't know if you had much use for this post.

The only way one can properly fix that is by being a vigilant player and speaking up with the tyranny comes out.

If I wanted to make it feel like the characters are fighting against themselves, I'd do it this way:<br><br>The player gets to choose a couple of traits relevant to her character, from the list (or possibly make up her own). This way, the character gets a certain "theme" and certain issues she faces, instead of every character facing the same long list of issues. The I'd let the GM call for rolls for these traits when she feels the situation demands a roll ("This guy is beating up a child. Rage check, please."). The player has a choice. Either she lets the character get a Stress point, and then act as she wants, or she makes the roll and has to obey the result. I'd do the Stress point thing before the roll, to give it a bit of a gambling nature. This way, if the result is "bad", the player feels "Damnit! I should have paid that Stress point", instead of "Damnit! That bastard GM is forcing me to pay a Stress point". Of course, there isn't really a "bad" result here. This is the character reacting according to parameters set up by the player.<br><br>I'd also include ways to change the values and maybe the traits themselves to reflect character growth. Also, maybe the player should get to name some example circumstances where rolls would be called for, like "Rage: I get really angry when people are mean to children". This is to avoid things like "This policeman is totally beating the crap of that guy. Rage check." "Why? He's probably a criminal. The policeman is just doing his job!". The GM's role would then be to supply circumstances where it would be inappropriate, disadvantageous or downright dangerous to act according to the character's passions. Like, the character is undercover, trying to infiltrate a crime organization. One of the criminals are beating up a child.\n<blockquote>The GM will break the rules regardless of whether or not someone gives him the go ahead.</blockquote>\nI guess we have different experiences. In my experience, if you write very clearly "The GM may NOT break the rules. She is a player like everyone else. Any deviance from the rules should be made through group consensus only," then the GM will get that she doesn't have absolute power.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225131/#Comment_225131" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T12:10:56+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 12:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To piggyback on Simon's suggestion, there is two advantages I see.  <br><br>First, there does seem to be a greater respect for player agency in this version.  I like choosing the stress token before the roll-- it seems to be more of an honest choice.  The difference between "I can hit myself with Stress, or I can risk the roll" feels like a choice.  "My character can behave outside my vision of him or I can get hit with Stress" seems more like a penalty for a bad roll (read: Punishment.)<br><br>Second, it allows the players to establish flags-- communication with the GM-- about the game they want to play.  The guy that picks Rage as one of his issues, and clarifies that "he gets really angry when people are mean to children" is saying quite a bit on what he wants out of the game.  One, he wants to be able to beat down child abusers, so the GM should give him child abusers to beat down.  Two, because you seem to want actual moral choices to be part of this game, it means that the GM should endeavor to challenge the player on that issue.<br><br>When I have become stressed as a result of moral decisions it has been from trying ignore injustice or vice.  In my experience, stress has been the result of shutting the hell up when doing the right thing would make more problems than it would solve.  Maybe Judgment tests should be circumstances where *both* results will suck in their own unique way, and taking the Stress is the result of not dealing with the situation?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225203/#Comment_225203" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T15:06:27+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  3:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2009 3:39PM by MacLeod.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a>:</b> Hm...
