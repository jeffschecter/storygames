As we played and analyzed it afterwards, Brendon said that it might suffer from pocket play. Now, I've never heard this term before, and I'm not sure if it is supposed to be negative or positive. By my understanding of the term Shock: creates pocket play. This is what I think it means: play that consists of the characters never meeting up creating their own stories. To me, this doesn't sound bad, however, I don't think it unWritten exclusively produces this type of play. In fact, we (another group) played a game about a family that went on a road trip to Disneyland. That game, though it ended prematurely, was great fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to go into our game this weekend a bit, then ask how pocket play is bad, or good. (Prepare yourself for a lot of cliches, it was intentional.)<br/><br/>So we played a game that was set in a "Near Future Akira'esk" world, the story would revolve around "Secret Governmental Experiments" and "Enhanced Humans." From that we created three characters; a burned out detective, Brendon; a resentful philanthropical lawyer who "knew that the truth was out there," me; and an escaped test subject, Greg. Through play we discovered that the lawyer was "hired" to find and represent the escapee, and make sure he loses the case. The detective, who worked for the city (we didn't name it by this point) was sent to investigate these mysterious happenings and murders, that was, unwittingly, perpetuated by the escapee. The game consisted of a few scenes of the escapee escaping, a few scenes of the lawyer dealing with his past and resenting his present, and a few with the detective dealing with strangeness turning up around him. they made for good introductory scenes, we all bought into our characters. Just as we were about to get together we had to quit. Most likely we'll not be finishing this game because, well, I'm not sure when we'll be able to get together again, our schedule is hit or miss, anyway...<br/><br/>From the point we left, the lawyer had just found the escapee and the detective just started hunting the lawyer. The detective new that the lawyer had the escapee and he new that the escapee was dangerous. Based on what was developing, the game could have gone in two directions, 1) the three main characters could have found a common enemy and began working together, no pocket play, or, more interestingly, 2) The lawyer and the escapee could have begun to work together to try and figure out what was really going on, while the detective lead a hunt to find and stop the dangerous escapee. 1/3rd of us would have opposed 2/3rds of us. pocket play, for the detective at least...<br/><br/>Now my question, how is pocket play bad? The system supports characters that oppose each other and ones that don't. It would not have lessoned anyones table time. <br/><br/>So those are my questions. What do you ladies and gentlemen think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135812/#Comment_135812" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T08:46:10+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  8:46AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it sounds fantastic, to be honest <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Is that an official term: pocket play? I think I prefer that to almost any (semi-)forced party-grouping.<br/><br/>IME play that starts as pocket play often moves towards some kind of interconnection between the story lines, especially in long term play  - you can of course link quite a bit with relations between player characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135835/#Comment_135835" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T10:40:01+00:00" title="March 21, 2008 10:40AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if that's the "official term."
