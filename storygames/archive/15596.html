After I make an adjective sticky or locked, do I give the Push dice to the player's Charged or Discharged section? We played with putting it in Charged, but it also meant that I was getting a lot of Push dice to utilize to increase Target Numbers...<br/><br/>I really like the Plot Map generation process, but had some issues with it. In my game, I used the Los Angeles Transmission, and rolled up The Producers, Pi Larson, and High Speed Chase. If the protagonists hadn't tapped Michealangelo Dumas at generation, it would have been such a bare-bones plot.<br/><br/>At runtime, the plot pretty much focused in on these four nodes all the time, and never really deviated. It felt too focus/constrained, and I didn't want to randomly throw in another faction without the player's prompting, but I wonder if I was being too timid with changing the narrative?<br/><br/>I also noticed that the player's didn't tap their other Connections for more information (one did go to Killa Nine, but immediately asked about Michealangelo Dumas, so the story remained tightly focused on the main triangle). I don't like pushing too hard on the players to behave in one way or another, but should I have prompted them more to talk to Connections?<br/><br/>I know that I should have pushed more dividing loyalties among the protagonists between Pi Larson and Michaelangelo, so that's my bad. <br/><br/>Perhaps I am too stuck on ApocWorld's principles, and that Technoir requires a more impromptu/looser way to GM?<br/><br/>Any other general advice about how to run Technoir "properly"?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353643/#Comment_353643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T16:20:55+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  4:20PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2012 11:32PM by C_Edwards.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Push dice used <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">or spent</span> become Discharged. They become Charged when it's your turn to act (not react).<br/><br/>The Plot Map generation procedures only give you the seed for an intrigue. There is a lot of room for complications and additions within the three initial Plot Map elements. I keep those initial elements as the anchor for what's going down in play but I add and invent things as play demands.<br/><br/>As an example, the first time I used the Los Angeles Sprawl Transmission I rolled Lamborghini Stella, Saito Arena, and The Producers. Pondering how they might be connected as the players went through character creation, I came up with The Producers making an assassination attempt on the driver of the Stella at Saito Arena. That left a lot of questions unanswered so I thought a bit about how the assassination attempt would be made and who The Producers might want to assassinate and why.<br/><br/>Pulling ideas from the Transmission I determined that the assassination attempt would take place during a Blood Derby match at the arena and that the target was a famous actor doing a promotional appearance for her new Immatrix immersion experience. It also seemed to me that having a blood derby player as the assassin would be pretty cool. The players took some favors and that got a couple Connections added to the map, but the core intrigue was already there. The connections helped flesh things out a little and gave rise to another potential layer of intrigue.<br/><br/>The important part, I think, is what I did next. I inserted the PCs into the Plot Map at an angle to the three initial Plot Map elements I rolled. The PCs got a job from a Connection that was already on the map, but that job dealt with replacing the cybernetic hand of the (I had now decided) unwitting assassin with one that was physically identically but internally contained some means of killing the target that could be triggered remotely (I hadn't determined at this point if that would be a bomb or something else). The unwitting assassin was the Captain of the Devastation Dames blood derby team. So, after the PCs talked to their Connection and got the job I put her on the map.<br/><br/>Basically, I inserted the PCs into play at least a couple degrees removed from the the central intrigue. They would have plenty of opportunity to dig deeper if they wanted to (and they did), uncover the greater plot, or investigate any other plots discovered through play and generally get into a fun bunch of trouble. Maybe they stop the assassination attempt, maybe they don't. Maybe they get setup as fall guys by The Producers. Maybe they do their job, take their pay, and go home. Who knows? All that stuff works itself out through play.<br/><br/>So don't be afraid to embellish or flesh out that initial plot seed and don't feel like you have to start the PCs right at the front door to the big intrigue at the center of play. Noir mysteries are usually layered, and the more layers you peel back the more dangerous things get.<br/><br/>Regarding the players not tapping Connections, I don't think you necessarily need to prompt them unless perhaps they've run up against a wall and are at a loss at what to do next. Also, just because they ask about something or someone specific doesn't mean they'll get the full scoop, they won't be misled somehow, or that getting their answers won't lead to a lot more questions.<br/><br/>I think you could do a lot worse than using Apocalypse World MC principles and moves to guide you in running Technoir. Most of them probably fit right in. Countdown clocks would work well too. The basic MC agenda seems pretty key to me for Technoir, particularly "Make the world seem real" as doing so is pretty important to keeping the adjective system fully functional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn" title="Murgh_Bpurn"><img alt="Murgh_Bpurn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn">Murgh_Bpurn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353681/#Comment_353681" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T22:31:10+00:00" title="January  9, 2012 10:31PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2012 10:51PM by Murgh_Bpurn.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe when you *spend* Push Dice they go to the player you're giving the adjective too - Push Economy (pg 134).

I thought for sure I specified that somewhere, but I can't for the life of me find it right now. <br/><br/>If you have so many Push dice that it becomes trivial for you to block your players' actions, that's a good sign that it's time to start messing their characters up. Attack them, give them sticky and locked adjectives, and give them back their Push dice ASAP. Players can hog Push dice if they want to\u2014it pulls the game into subtler territory\u2014but you can't. You have to deal back as much as they give you.<br/><br/>Like Chris pointed out, your plot map is just a seed of an idea. Use any means at your disposal to create exciting content for your players to deal with. The Transmissions and plot maps are just tools to use to come up with those ideas. Don't let them limit or constrict you. If you see a cool object or threat you'd like to involve\u2014or have an idea for something of your own\u2014don't hesitate to add it in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353729/#Comment_353729" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T09:19:55+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  9:19AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the replies everyone + Mr. Keller. <br/><br/>It takes me a session or two to get into the proper "flow" of a new game, ie. internalizing the mechanics so that I can free up my brain to the proper pacing of the game itself.<br/><br/>My players didn't have any real complaints so the clunkiness I felt was not felt by them.<br/><br/>And it has been driving me nuts trying to find that Push die/spent/charged rule!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn" title="Murgh_Bpurn"><img alt="Murgh_Bpurn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn">Murgh_Bpurn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353733/#Comment_353733" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T09:58:25+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  9:58AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy, thanks for some more clarification. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>btw, do you plan on making the Kickstarter extras available for purchase?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353818/#Comment_353818" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T18:15:24+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  6:15PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am also interested in those extras.

It should become apparent to the NPCs that they aren't making progress, so they should run away, retreat, or otherwise find something else to do.  The PCs will either spend their Push dice to stop them, or the NPCs will get away and report to their superiors, who will likely do something big off-screen that the PCs won't like.  They should have pressed when they had the advantage.

I thought there were rules for that, but I don't have my book on me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368494/#Comment_368494" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:32:36+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:32PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 12:51PM by MikeRiverso.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            N.B. My experience with Technoir is fairly limited, but here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>Seems like there's two aspects to handling #1: <br/><br/>First and foremost, respect the adjectives. Is the antagonist "scared"? Maybe he'll run away, rather than just take an action to shake it off. Is he "pinned"? Maybe he'll surrender, especially if the person holding him down is a better fighter. Is his firewall "breached"? Maybe he'll disconnect from the Interface, to prevent serious damage.<br/><br/>Secondly, use the antagonist to keep the pressure on; make your players desperately want to use their push dice. If the antagonist just keeps coming, sooner or later the protagonists will use their push dice to end the contention. Remember not to hoard your push dice, and perhaps remind the players not to hoard theirs either. The game is more interesting when push dice are being spent.<br/><br/>As for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, I'd probably do it like this:<br/><br/>1) No roll to do the surgery, but you should have an appropriate vector: the protagonist doing the surgery should have the Doctor training program, or otherwise they just wouldn't know what to do.<br/>2) Apply the sticky adjective "Recovering" (there's probably a better word for it) to the recipient, then immediately do a Lethal Consequences roll to see if he is dead or dying.<br/>3) Finally, you can make Treat rolls as normal to deal with the new adjectives.<br/><br/>Obviously, there's a little risk involved, and the protagonist is going to need some time to recover. The risk makes it tempting to just go to one of the connections for a splice, or pay the 5 Kred fee to have it installed by an NPC. These options are safer for the protagonist, and would probably spice up the plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368591/#Comment_368591" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T07:30:27+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  7:30AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet, that all makes sense. I guess for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, it seemed lame to have all the conflict run away, or for the protaganists to beat it so easily. I guess... conflict will be lame until they give me push dice is the idea? I thought there was a happier medium there for some reason. Mike, your surgery solution seems like what I was looking for!
