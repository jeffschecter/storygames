                    When he wasn't dissing SG, Malcolm Sheppard brought up sort of an interesting point in <a href="http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/12/looking-back-on-06.html" rel="nofollow">his latest blog entry</a>:
<blockquote>But the thing that the tabletop RPG community must accept -- must be beaten about the head with, in fact -- is that roleplaying, despite being one of the major new forms of entertainment of the late 20 and early 21st centuries, does not require tabletop RPGs. A tabletop RPG is a medium for the activity of roleplaying. MMORPGs, chat tools and fora are other media that support roleplaying -- the dominant media for the activity, in fact.<br/><br/>So the question for game designers in 2007 is this: What does your new game design offer that roleplaying in an alternate medium does not?</blockquote>
I'm not entirely sure I agree with him here (as I tend to not agree with Malcolm), but the comment about TRPGs being a "medium for the activity of roleplaying" seemed interesting, as was the question he poses at the end of the above quote.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>

                            The idea of TRPGs being a "medium for the activity of roleplaying" isn't especially new, IMO. Or at least my first reaction was to go "Well, duh...".

                            A side point:
<blockquote>But the year wasn't free of disappointments. I still find much of the so-called "gaming community" (<b>very little of which is actually based around playing games, now more than ever</b>) disappointing. By and large, 2006 was a year characterized by intellectual cowardice. Various communities that talked big about theory, craft and shared practice were really fronts for people to be "safe." Levi Kornelsen's GameCraft established itself as yet another forum for useless backslapping <b>after the tradition of Story Games</b>.</blockquote>
Huh.  What would an internet gaming community that IS based around playing games actually look like? Not only did about 10-15 splinter events, live groups, and actual gaming meetups (including Camp Nerdly) happen because of this place, but all I see around here is stuff that relates to actual events/conditions of tabletop gaming. I mean, I founded two local RPG/gaming meetup groups in the Triangle, and participate in two others (Lost Goblin and NCSU's gaming events), but I honestly have blinders on because I cannot see how a group could be any less focused on Actual Roleplaying.  Hmmm. <br/><br/>Also, I have to say "AWESOME".  Less than a year old and this message board is recognized as being a (or having a) "tradition". Huh.<br/><br/>Finally, regarding Levi's "Useless Forum For backslapping".  Sorry, doesn't add up:<br/><a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/index.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/index.php</a><br/>Look at the numbers.  I've not said it publicly, but I hold that as long as the Tool Kit forum and Deconstruction forums togrther are larger than or equal to the Soap Box forum (34 threads 553 posts), then Levi's doing it right. Heck, Toolkit itself is larger than Soap Box (58 threads; 672 posts). That indicates to me, pretty damn clearly, that people are talking about the actual act/craft/hooyah of roleplaying, and not about the latest shiny products*.<br/><br/>The fact that all of Malcolm's participation has been in the Soap Box/ranty forum and not the Tool Kit forum, or any other forum for which the site was actually built for, just tells me that he was <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/ziggurat/RandomFun/photo#4955385869002407954" rel="nofollow">Doing It Wrong</a>. The other Soap Boxers are posting away in Tool Kit, Deconstruction, Garage, etc As Well As posting in the Soap Box forum. It just smells to me that he's upset when he drops a bomb in Soap Box like "Technology has destroyed the need for RPGs", and gets replies of "Huh?" instead of "YESSSSsssss!!". He even brings up the point again in his blog: It's obviously a big issue for him, and it appears to tick him off that this idea isn't being glammed onto by other communities.  Perhaps his criteria for a 'backslapping community' is "Do they immediately agree with my opinions, or do they resist my teachings?", I dunno.<br/><br/>/rant<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Personally, I built S-G to be a chatty place to talk about the latest shiny stuff, as well as all the craft, gamemaking and related fun.  It was entirely accidental, but not at all unwanted, that so much more awesome stuff developed from there. I never stated the goals of this site to be "We will start the Revolution Here!!!". Rather, it's the lounge to hang out in as you come and go and actually get out there and run those gaming sessions. Aaaaanyway.                        </div>

                            Malcolm's wrong about almost everything he says. It's that very slim percentage of getting things right that separates him from the RPGpundit, who is only ever right by accident.<br/><br/>In this case, he is clearly wrong. MMORPGs do not do the same thing as tabletop RPGs. They are not the same activity, although they may share a name.

                            BUT, back to the point:
<blockquote>But the thing that the tabletop RPG community must accept -- must be beaten about the head with, in fact -- is that roleplaying, despite being one of the major new forms of entertainment of the late 20 and early 21st centuries, does not require tabletop RPGs.

Sure. I dig.  Does anyone... NOT dig? This isn't one of those "First they oppose the idea, then they laugh at the idea, then they say the idea is so basic that it's worth thinking about, then it's accepted as truth" things. I think we all pretty much skipped all that stuff right down to the "accepted as truth" page. We don't have to crack Baudrillard to get some sociological insight here, it's pretty self-explanatory, and sure we all get it.<br/><br/>I mean, both badminton and hockey are mediums for physical activity, exercise and sportsmanship. I prefer badminton. So does Jet Li, incidentally (he pretty much exclusively plays badminton for his exercise between movies. Chinese Badminton is badass: People die and shit).<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying here is <b>Jet Li is awesome</b>.
<blockquote>So the question for game designers in 2007 is this: What does your new game design offer that roleplaying in an alternate medium does not?</blockquote>
Honestly? Damn fine question, something that any reflective designer/author/etc should be thinking about. And if you have an answer that satisfies yourself, awesome.  I sure as shit won't say, "Your answer must appeal to us/the community" or whatever.<br/><br/>I'd say it should be somewhere in that Power 19. Maybe it could be the Missing 20th Question.<br/><br/>In any case, sure I agree with what he said there. Straightforward, not too arrogant, and it makes sense. I don't understand why he says, "<b>must be beaten about the head with, in fact</b>", cause it totally doesn't seem like it is needed, but hey I can roll with hyperbole, I do it all the time.<br/><br/>I don't find much to agree with in his airy disdain for other stuff in his post, but still it was fun reading. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Actually, for Malcolm, that's the only thing that matters: That they are <b>in any way</b> comparable. They are both vehicles for the facilitation of the transport of matter. In one case, the matter happens to be people, so needs a design that is not alike the design for an 18-Wheeler that transports steel.<br/><br/>Like that, the folks in the Duran Duran Yahoogroup Chat Communities who pretend to be members of Duran Duran and write elaborate stories about sex and saving the world, they too are roleplaying (in a very different way) and using chat as a medium.<br/><br/>MANY folks (not all) who play in MMOs like World of Warcraft also like to slip into a role a little of a protector of a fantasy domain, and whether they're all "Forsooth! An Orc!" or "OMG Stop killspamming me d00d", they're still being a personal and playing out a role. MMOs ALSO offer an experience for about a third of the crowd which isn't roleplaying at all, but is rather killing, levelling, powergrabbing, without any interaction. But hey, same can be said of people who collect RPGs and never play them.<br/><br/>But yeah, on the fundamental level he's just saying, "There's this activity called ROLEPLAYING, man. It's OUT THERE, man. And tabletop gaming is just one way to do it".  Uh, yeah, nothing weird there. But nothing too deep, either. He is comparing ferraris to 18-Wheelers. And apples to oranges (they're fruits, right?). He happens to be right here (IMO), and gives us one nice, small, itty-bitty nugget that's actually Usable out of the mess: the question to designers: "Think about your design. What does it do that other mediums don't?". That's an interesting question worth pondering for a minute or two.<br/><br/>At least, in my book anyway.

This is pretty much what I saw him do with the Forge, his favorite whipping boy. I think he has a total of maybe seven posts there, almost all of which (iirc) are in a single thread in which he denounces GNS, or at least GNS as he incorrectly understood it.<br/><br/>But... I didn't intend to rag on Sheppard. I've turned over a new leaf, and instead try to focus on the few ideas of his I find have merit, rather than the huge number of ones I feel have none. Ergo, why I posted the above quote.<br/><br/>And Aaron is right... this isn't anything new, though it's good to be reminded.                        </div>

                            On the "medium of roleplaying" idea, it's partly true and partly not.<br/><br/>It's true in the sense that people who played Dungeons and Dragons twenty years ago now play World of Warcraft instead. It's false, or misleading, to label both those activities as "roleplaying". Sure, you can call it all roleplaying, but they are very different activities.<br/><br/>But it's true that geeks are drifting away from RPGs and, instead, playing networked games, posting on the Internet or writing fan fiction.<br/><br/>I like the post, though. It's written in a deliberately provocative style, but there's good stuff in there. Look at this. It's great:
<blockquote>Many, many indie games feel designed around the reward cycle gained by having people talk about the game on forums, blogs and so on. Don't they tend to follow a single core concept to an extreme? Don't many of them revolve around a kind of elevator pitch, precis-or-nothing idea? Isn't there an antipathy for games that take time and effort to get comfortable with? There are exceptions (The Burning Wheel's an example), but it seems to me that these games are not really accessible for the sake of a tabletop group, but for the sake of posting about them in fora. But your comfort in posting about an RPG on the Internet is not an indication of its quality.</blockquote>

Sheppard's good buddy Bruce Baugh once made the comment that the <i>typical</i> tabletop RPG experience isn't all that much different from your average CRPG/MMORPG. I.e., Joe D&amp;Der isn't doing all that much with pen-and-paper D&amp;D he probably couldn't do with Neverwinter Nights. IIRC, this was in the context of yet another "Are MMORPGs killing the hobby?" thread.<br/><br/>Essentially, I think that he was getting at the same question Sheppard is posing, i.e., where is the incentive to play your TRPG if it's not giving me anything I couldn't get from, say, <i>World of Warcraft</i>?<br/><br/>The irony is that, IMO, the very games and communities that Sheppard (and sometimes Baugh) are so critical of are the ones that provide (or foster the games that provide) the unique experience they're advocating. E.g., <i>Polaris</i> just begs to be played by people sitting around a table, sharing a social experience. Ironically, I don't think the same could be said for a lot of the d20 and WoD stuff that Sheppard and Baugh earn their living from.                        </div>

<p>So the question for game designers in 2007 is this: What does your new game design offer that roleplaying in an alternate medium does not?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I think the question is hilarious.  Especially in the SG/Forgie bashing context.  I mean, I can't think of a single game to come from either community that offers something that <em>any</em> other medium could.  We're talking about communities of people who are very concious of making the very best of the medium.  To even imply that games like <em>The Mountain Witch</em> or <em>My Life with Master</em> could do just as well in MMORPG format is just plain silly.</p>
<p>I don't think the question is even worth of adding to any design work.  I don't think I need to ask myself if my game would be better off in another medium any more than I need to ask myself if I really need to wear shoes every morning.  I am confident in my answers to both questions before they're even asked.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite><br/>It's true in the sense that people who played Dungeons and Dragons twenty years ago now play World of Warcraft instead.

First, I disagree the type of gamer who playedD&amp;D is really playing MMORPGs now or that he's happier there. After all, there are about a bazillion different reasons to play D&amp;D (Then or now.) and only some of those are better served by games like WoW. Second, I'd disagree that what many people do on those games is so fundamentally different from what we do. Now, MMORPGs work completly different from Tabletop rpgs and sometimes I'm sloppy in calling them "not roleplaying games" myself, but I think that what many people on WoW, EVE or whatever do is "roleplaying".<br/><br/>Just my two cents.                        </div>

I do worry that the word "roleplaying" can refer to Dungeons and Dragons, or Morrowind (a single-player console game), or World of Warcraft. It's important that we don't think that, just because they're all called "roleplaying games", the "roleplaying" that takes place is the same in all of them.<br/><br/>But, sure, I'd imagine some actual roleplaying goes on in WoW.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><br/>Sheppard's good buddy Bruce Baugh once made the comment that the<i>typical</i>tabletop RPG experience isn't all that much different from your average CRPG/MMORPG. I.e., Joe D&amp;Der isn't doing all that much with pen-and-paper D&amp;D he probably couldn't do with Neverwinter Nights. IIRC, this was in the context of yet another "Are MMORPGs killing the hobby?" thread.<br/>...<br/>The irony is that, IMO, the very games and communities that Sheppard (and sometimes Baugh) are so critical of are the ones that provide (or foster the games that provide) the unique experience they're advocating. E.g.,<i>Polaris</i>just begs to be played by people sitting around a table, sharing a social experience. Ironically, I don't think the same could be said for a lot of the d20 and WoD stuff that Sheppard and Baugh earn their living from.</blockquote>

I agree, Mr. Baugh seems a nice chap.

<blockquote>So the question for game designers in 2007 is this: What does your new game design offer that roleplaying in an alternate medium does not?</blockquote>
I think it's a damn good question, as well, though mr. Sheppard approaches it from a bit wrong angle. A lot of "story games" already provide an answer for the question; they facilitate player created content and act very much like board games, which is something that a lot of other roleplaying mediums do not. MMORPG's certainly don't; they tend to have static enviroments in which players can act through their characters (lot like "traditinonal" roleplaying games), but very little of actual content creation. Certain other mediums (irc, IM, and MU*'s, though arguably it's harder in them in terms of creating actual objects) also allow this, but without the straightforward face-to-face social context.<br/><br/>As for "roleplaying", I'm kind of hoping that we could ditch the term as something that has definitive meaning. It does not. It's just a buzzword used in place of various activities that could be or could not be similar. Going with the transportation analogy, you could drive a car, walk or fly, and the only thing in common is that you get from place A to place B. The experience and the methods are different, each with unique pro's and con's.                        </div>
