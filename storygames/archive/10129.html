Lady Blackbird, Snargle, and Arkam were all NPCs; Jeff played Captain Vance and Scott took up Naomi Bishop. After breaking out of their brig and taking out some Imperial marines (Naomi Bishop is a killing machine!), they directed Snargle and Arkam to disable the <i>Hand of Sorrow</i>'s engines while they sought out Lady Blackbird herself. I decided Milady had been recognized as a noble and thus was being held in the Executive Officer's quarters awaiting some gentle but persuasive interrogation. The PCs broke in just as Lady Blackbird was about to attempt fly over to the <i>Owl</i> using her weather magic (questionable). Vance teleported her there instead, and moments later more marines approached. Injured and angry, the protagonists barred the door, then tore through the decking (Bishop's Secret) and escaped to a lower deck, covering their escape with one of the XO's expensive oriental rugs. They had also widened the hole in the hull created by Blackbird during her attempted escape, making it look like they had jumped out into the Wild Blue.<br/><br/>Sneaking through the <i>Hand of Sorrow</i>, they made it to the hangar deck, where they could see the <i>Owl</i> lashed to the imperial cruiser by several anchor chains, as well as a chain catwalk about a 100 m long connecting them. They could make out Snargle and Arkam on the <i>Owl</i>, working furiously to loose it and get underway. As they sprinted across the catwalk, marines began shooting from the hangar deck above, and the <i>Owl</i>'s gun started turning toward them! Lady Blackbird was attempting to strafe the marines, but being unfamiliar with gunnery she cut the catwalk instead. Bishop slid down the collapsing chain bridge onto the hull of the <i>Owl</i>, but Vance, caught on the other side of the break, swung away from the smaller ship, hanging on to the severed bridge for dear life. When the end of the bridge swung back into view, Vance was nowhere to be seen, presumed dead.<br/><br/>Snargle, daredevil goblin pilot that he is, snatched up the controls of the already moving <i>Owl</i> and careened around the hull of the much more massive <i>Hand of Sorrow</i>. There was Vance, perched on one of the imperial cruiser's bristling gun emplacements. They picked him up, and tore into the Wild Blue as the lumbering <i>Hand of Sorrow</i>, her engines sabotaged, slowly listed starboard and slid into the noxious reaches of the Lower Depths...<br/><br/>We had a blast, and the mashup system of <b>TSoY</b> and <b>The Pool</b> played really well. Initially, it seemed like all their tags would make the players unstoppable, but it didn't turn out that way. As the stakes mounted and their pool dwindled, things started to go wrong, and complications abounded. I'm sure that's the game design intent, so well done on that score.<br/><br/>One beef I have is with the Captain's name; as cool as "Cyrus Vance" sounds, it's also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Vance" rel="nofollow">real person</a>.

I'm glad the game went well for you. Was this a one shot, or do you plan to keep the story going? How was the dynamic between the Captain and Bishop? Friendly, rivals, something else? I haven't played with just those two as PCs, but it seems like a fun match up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hieronymous" title="hieronymous"><img alt="hieronymous" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://malcontent.sourdust.com/img/th_coverreve200.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hieronymous">hieronymous</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225604/#Comment_225604" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T21:40:51+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  9:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2009 9:45PM by hieronymous.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi John,<br/><br/>Great game. I had underestimated how long it would take to play, so while we meant it as a one-shot we've got a lot more story to play through. I'm hoping to schedule a follow-up session soon (with more players to pick up some/all the NPCs), and I'll post an AP after we resume.<br/><br/>Frankly, with all the sneaking around the <i>Hand of Sorrow</i> crawling with imperial marines, and Lady Blackbird herself in only one short scene, there wasn't much chance for Vance's and Bishop's potential rivalry to emerge; I'd say they were professionally cooperative. We'll see how things develop once they are both in closer contact with milady...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exedore6" title="exedore6"><img alt="exedore6" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exedore6">exedore6</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314420/#Comment_314420" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-26T10:57:46+00:00" title="February 26, 2011 10:57AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We just played LB last night.
