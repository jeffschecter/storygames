                    On <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=20798" rel="nofollow">a thread on nerdnyc</a>, Forager mentioned:<br/>
<i>Here's my problem with D&amp;D at low levels: the trappings of the game - the artwork, the color text, etc. - promises a game of heroic fantasy adventure. But playing D&amp;D at low levels is more about building up enough power so that you can engage in heroic fantasy adventure. Chris Chinn (bankuei) has made the observation that on the cover of the red box D&amp;D basic set is a picture of a warrior confronting a dragon. But the game inside doesn't give you the tools to make that picture "come alive".</i><br/>
<br/>
That unlocked an ocean of memories! The first time I played a published RPG was in sophomore year in high school in the cartooning club. The GM was our art teacher. He gave me a bunch of fiction to read, I was amazed by the art and he kept saying think Lord of the Rings. They asked me to come up with a character idea.<br/>
<br/>
"I am a young but promising magician whose town was murdered by a dragon. I threw spell after spell at it but my magic was of no help. And I had never used a sword before. But as the dragon tried to swallow me whole, I got lucky and plunged the sword into his eye and killed it. I now wear its skin with the names of my dead family written on it as a symbol of the day I became a man."<br/>
<br/>
The GM looked at me and said ummm... you can't have a sword if you are a magic user and what you described would never happen. You would have never killed a dragon and you can't have dragon scale armor. And you can't fling spell after spell at the dragon. You only get 1 spell. So we will say a dragon killed your town and you ran away and swore revenge. But we're first level so it will be probably a year or so before you're ever even ready to face even a baby dragon.<br/>
<br/>
I played the game. Out of 2-3 hours of playing, I only had fun 2 times. 1 time I cast a magic missile which was and is still more fun than it has any right to be. The second I used caltrops hidden in greek fire to stop a bunch of people from chasing us. After that, I stopped playing. I've never played war games. And I hated that aspect of the game. Even if I liked it, as a wizard I couldn't do shit.<br/>
<br/>
The next game I immediately played a series of superhero RPGs. DC followed by Marvel. Marvel rocked! From what I can remember, it did exactly what it promised. I had some guy with UNEARTHLY strength and I was hooked! It was just like the comics. It felt right. I fell in love! I almost gave up on RPGs. This totally turned me around.<br/>
<br/>
Then I played shadowrun. At the time I hated guns. I didn't want to use a gun. But every character I made got their ass kicked because I didn't have a gun. Then I found out about hackers and thought this way I can play and not be violent. I played a hacker which meant I did nothing for 75% of the game and the 25% that I did play, I played alone and everyone else was bored. I finally learned to love Shadowrun when I started making brutal gun happy killers. And then I had an amazing time.<br/>
<br/>
Then we played Starwars. I was fucking pissed because everyone else had played for 2 years and had amazing characters and they made me start from the equivalent of level 1. And I couldn't do anything! It sucked! I was soooo bitter. So then I manipulated the fuck out of everyone outside the game into having a time travel episodes into the far past. Before that I stole all these plans on the Death Star which was already built. Then I conned the GM into letting me stay in the past. Then the next adventure I went from being level 1 to like level 20!!! With everyone else being level 10. The GM gave me all the XP I would have gotten for all the years that passed by between those 2 sessions. And on top of that, I became the inventor of the Death Star and was a billionair. Then I turned evil and made everyone pay for making me play a first level character at first which included me setting up event knows as the "Hoth Massacre" where... fuck, I won't even get into it. I was such an asshole. Eventually everyone ganged up and killed me.<br/>
<br/>

                            The first time I played an RPG I was 5. It was D&amp;D. My friends and I got stick swords and become adventurers and made our little brothers be kobolds. We beat the crap out of them all day long. It was 1979 -- and may have been one of the earlier boffer LARPS. <br><br>Over time I settled down into playing D&amp;D as a boardgame. Years passed happily like that. Then I got the idea (don't remember where) that RPGs should tell stories. Years then passed in which I had no clue what I was doing. I'd buy mountains of RPG stuff and sit there looking at it with the dread feeling in my gut that it had some obvious use that I just couldn't make heads or tales of. When I tried to use it to make stories it didn't work. I could make it work when I just played it as a game, but surely that wasn't the point, right? <br><br>I finally figured out that the point was for me to tell a story and to bring the players along for it. Then followed years of the painfull teenage power-game angst of the Dungeon Master with his submissive players, emotionally and verbally abusing them into doing just as I pleased. College changed that, as I had to learn to be cool. So I became the Lord Illusionist, and learned to force my players along transparently. I got really good at doing exactly what I wanted in a game without the players feeling my hand on their back the whole time. <br><br>Then someone started talking to me about Narrativism and this game called Sorcerer. I think it may have been Joshua BishopRoby. Fucker. Screwed up everything. <br><br>I never should have stopped beating up on people with a stick sword.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            1985.  Nine years old.  The night after the Wrightstown Elementary School Barn Dance.  (Yes, we all looked adorable.)  <br>
<br>
Hollis's mom was into weird hippie stuff, and had bought him a copy of Red Box D&amp;D.  I played a Cleric with Charisma 4, fought Bargle the Infamous, and Timmy Melvin and I bribed the DM with Tastycake candy.<br>
<br>
1.  Bargle has been a fugitive for justice for 20 years now.  I'll get him someday.<br>

Brand, all I remember about finding the Forge was the original GNS essay, which Laura showed me.  Maybe I showed you?  Those days are dim and hazy, full of WoD bullshit I try not to think about (okay, I love reminiscing about it, but it's like picking at a scab).                        </br></br></div>

                            My first game was Marvel Super-Heroes.  People speak well of that system on RPG.net but I can't remember a damned thing about it other than that chart on the back and FASERIP.<br>

I think I played Cloak of Cloak &amp; Dagger and Hobgoblin flew into my cloak on his little flying sled-dingus.<br/>

He fell victim to Cloak's fear and darkness powers.<br/>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>I'm fairly sure it was you. I finally came fully to the Forge because of Riddle of Steel -- but by that point I'd already known about it and been exposed to it. I think you had pointed me in the direction. I seem to remember me telling you something like "I don't need Sorcerer or these other half-games, I already have all the games I need." <br/><br/>But that could just be because I like to blame you for everything.                        </div>

                            My first game was Gamma World when I was 10. I had seen the D&amp;D books at my cousin's house, and I was soooo in love with them. But back home, my friend JT had Gamma World, so that's what we played. When I moved, I took photocopies of some of the GW charts and stuff with me and started up a game group in the new neighborhood using only those precious pages.<br/>
<br/>
You can do a lot with massive random mutation tables, weapon stats, and character sheets.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I remember most about those early days was our flat refusal of GM fiat. If the GM (which was usually me) said, "The Hoops catch up to you and throw nets over you," the players would all moan and wail. "No way! We roll to escape! We roll to cut the nets! We roll to scare them away!" Every single thing had to be thrown into the jaws of the mechanics and gnashed to pieces. It made for zany, madcap escapades as PCs failed rolls to notice the most obvious things or to manage a polite conversation without igniting a blood feud.<br/>
<br/>
The players were also fiercely independent. I would throw hook after hook to get them to "do my story" and they would ignore them all and go charging off to steal a town's water supply or something. I feel very lucky to have had players like this in my formative gaming years. The idea of the "GM's plot" just never took root, and I think my gaming was better for it in the long run.                        </div>

                            I played red box D&amp;D.  I think I was four, but maybe five, and my brother had played the game at elementary school so he ran it for me and my mom (my mom would not play another RPG for 20 years.)  I had a halfling.  I couldn't think of a name so he was called No-name.  We fought the rust monster.<br>
<br>
Every once in a while, I wonder about No-name (who later met an ignominious death in a snake pit).  Why didn't he have a name?  I'd like to remake the character.  Maybe in HeroQuest, with just:<br>
<br>
Halfling (17)<br>
No Name (15w)<br>
Doomed to Die in Snake Pit (1w)<br/>
<br/>
At the start.<br/>

                            Ben, your No Name halfling and my Nameless half-elf should get together.<br/>
<br/>
It was 1981, and I was 11.  It was the summer between fifth and sixth grade.  My best friend at the time had gotten into it through a friend of his, and had bought the first three AD&amp;D books.  I played the aforementioned nameless half-elf, and he ran an NPC paladin who was like 3rd level.  We ran through a dungeon, fighting mostly kobolds and orcs (and I didn't know what either of them were).  Getting tired of fighting monsters I couldn't picture mentally, we started going through the Monster Manual suggesting monsters to fight.  I got killed by a hydra...  Later, I asked my mom for "Dungeons and Dragons" and she picked up the Erol Otus red box.  I was clueless about the difference between that and AD&amp;D, but not for long...                        </div>

                            Gosh, I'm trying to remember the first time I actually, really played.<br><br>My friend Tadd brought his copy of <i>Robotech</i> to lunch in the Sixth Grade.  I thought it looked awesome.  Maybe I made a character, I don't remeber.<br/><br/>A week later, I went to the local hobby store and bought a copy of the <i>Invid Invasion</i> supplement, because you fought the giant crab-like aliens on TRANSFORMING MOTORCYCLES WITH RETRACTABLE SWORDS!  That was the coolest shit, ever.<br/><br/>The problem was, since it was only a supplement, I didn't have all the rules I needed in order to play the game.  I had no idea how to determine attributes, so I think I just made some up, based on the example characters.  Luckily, <i>Invid Invasion</i> included a reprinting of all the skills, or I would have been totally lost.  Maybe I tried to get my little brother to play with me.  Any early attempts no doubt failed horribly.<br/><br/>I kinda suspect the first game I ever actually played may have been either <i>Heroes Unlimited</i> (Palladium's superhero game), <i>Toon</i>, or Tadd's homebrew system, <i>Nomier</i>, which mostly involved creating cross-species hybrid's like half-dragon, quarter-elf, quarter-demon characters.  I have no memory of these early stories.<br/><br/>Very quickly, I decided that the people I was playing with were incompetent when it came to running games, so I took over being the GM.<br/><br/>I do remember playing in a <i>Rifts</i> game while in a YMCA afterschool program, where I played one of the fox-aliens from <i>Robotech: The Sentinels</i> in a giant, transforming hover-tank.  I remember being pissed off because I had the biggest <i>Robotech</i> gun (the tank cannon did 3d4x10 Mega Damage) but had to fight a <i>Rifts</i> Glitterboy whose gun did 3d6x10 Mega Damage.  Bogus!                        </br></br></div>

                            I played Robotech in late middleschool/early highschool. It was one of the few games I got to play rather than run. <br/><br/>I dated an Amazon. I had a transforming bike. (A cyclone? soemthing like that.) That's all I remember. However, I remember that it was cool to date an Amazon.                        </div>

                            I had all the Robotech books and we thought it was super cool. That is, until we actually made characters and played it. After the first part of the first combat -- which took close to an hour to resolve, thanks to hit rolls for dozens upon dozens of missiles and counter-shots -- we kind of stared at each other like, "Are they serious? This is a joke."<br/>
<br/>
Years later, I ran a FUDGE Robotech game that went much better. But we still only played it once.                        </div>

                            My first exposure to RPG's was a Traveller game that the guy who gave out locker key's at the "Y" was playing at the desk with his buddy.  They were nice to me (little 11yo kid that I was) and let me make up a character.  He was a scout.  He died during character creation.<br>
<br>
I owned blue-box DnD and loved it.  I introduced it to my buddies and we played it until the hinges fell off.  Then we played Gamma World, and AD&amp;D, and one game after another until we went off to college.                        </br></br></div>

                            I was at school, in the 5th grade.  Somehow we were told that a couple of teachers would be running D&amp;D if we wanted to try it.  So I rolled up a redbox thief and grouped with a few other kids and we wandered into the dungeon.  I remember that one of the characters rolled 1 HP, so when he was hit, he was told, "your pinky is cut off" and he died.  Somehow he was OK with it.<br/>
<br/>
It was a trippy adventure; filled with lots of enchanted pools that did crazy things-- enlarge bodyparts, turn people purple, etc.  I think we died taking on a troll... though someone tossed it in an acid pool to prevent its return.                        </div>

                            I was 10 or 11.  I was a big game fan, my dad taught me to play Chess, and I had a huge collection of the roll-and-move stuff that was mainstream at the time (Payday, Careers).  The local drugstore(!) had a couple shelves devoted to board games, and I was always on the lookout for the new thing.  One day this purple-grey box showed up on the shelf that said "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" on the cover.  I was fascinated.<br/>
<br/>
To buy a new game required several months of scraping and saving, so while I was waiting I read the back of the box scrupulously and looked at the grainy photo of what was inside, trying to figure out what this might be.  I was a fiend for Choose Your Own Adventures books, of which I had a couple, so I thought it might be something like that.  It looked like it had cards with maps on them, and maybe other cards that bits of text that told you what happened, or at least that was what I imagined from the bad photo.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the day came, I had the funds, and I went and bought the box.  I don't believe they ever restocked it.  Instead of what I expected, I got a HUGE rulebook, something called a "module" (at least it had maps in it) and some funky dice, and a crayon.  I read the rulebook cover to cover.<br/>
<br/>
Then I got my parents together.  They were pretty much the only people I had to play games with at the time (yes, my childhood sucked that bad).  I got them to roll up characters.  I tried to convince them to name the characters, but I don't think I succeeded.  I read the flavor text box from the first numbered encounter in B1: In Search of the Unknown.  They stared at me.  I put the game away.<br/>
<br/>
About a year later I got moved to a different school, and actually made a few friends.  A couple of them liked games as well.  So I got out the purple-grey box.  The module said 4-8 characters, so each of them (I had two players) rolled up three or four characters.  They actually gave them names.  I read the flavor text, and we were off.  We'd play for the 30-45 minutes between the time school got out and they had to get on the bus (or my dad arrived to pick me up).  The defining moment was a few sessions in.  They got into a fight with a purple worm, and one of the characters got swallowed.  The book explained that if you could kill the worm in so many turns, you could cut a swallowed character out before he was digested.<br/>
<br/>
The bus arrived.  I started packing up.  The players revolted!<br/>
<br/>
We round up rolling d20s in the parking lot next to the door of the bus as kids walked on.  The swallowed character was rescued.  We were hooked.<br/>
<br/>
A few months later, the school declared RPGs demonic, but that's another story.                        </div>

                            It was the summer of 1976 and my little brother had found an ad for someplace called "The Dungeon" hobby shop in Lake Geneva Wisconsin (I think the ad was in a "Savage Sword of Conan" mag).  He ordered a catalog and we started buying these cool little metal knights and stuff.  One order came with a glossy, single page B&amp;W flier for something called "Empire of the Petal Throne".  It was all about humans trapped with weird aliens on an exotic world that mixed super-technology and sword and sorcery violence and magic.  I pesterd my folks to get it for me for Christmas (I pesterd for months!), and they eventually did, although they had to send in additional money to get it since the price had gone up from $25 to the then outrageous $27.50 betwen the time I got the flier and the time they ordered the game.<br/>
<br/>
I remeber sitting in my bed all Christmas morning looking at the bizarre aliens, naked breasts, mayan looking architecture, and weird squiggly scripts.  I started  reading the cool backstory/future history of the setting, and was hooked (I was a SF fan and had been reading Vance, Herbert, etc. since I was 9 or so).  I spent a week trying to puzzle out how to play the damn game, and when we went back to school, convinced some friends to play.  Luckily, one of the new kids in our class had played some original D&amp;D, so at least had the basic concepts down, but we still got tons of things wrong, and found rules we were using incorrectly every time I went back and read the book again.<br/>
<br/>
We played the game more like a board or wargame, rolling up lots of random encounters (I used to have notebooks ful of lists of sea encounters I had had and fought as the captain of a pirate ship).  The next March, I convinced my dad to drive myself and 2 friends from the game the 6 hours to Jacksonville, Florida for a convention I had heard about somehow (maybe another flier in the Dungeon order?), which was called Gencon South.  When we arrived, we were shocked to find that hardly anybody had heard of EPT and that everyone played some game called "D&amp;D"...<br/>
<br/>
I still have that glossy, single page B&amp;W flier.<br/>

                            First time I played (well GMed actually):<br/>
<br/>
Fall of 1977 at my best friend's birthday weekend. He got the original blue box Basic D&amp;D (with the geomorphs and monsters and treasure sheets, not a module) as a present. His older brother had played in school. I had looked at the D&amp;D set in the store months prior, and turned this pencil and paper game down in favor of Tractics, a good wholesome miniatures game. I was rather skeptical about this imaginary pencil and paper game, so when everyone set up to play, I decided to just watch (this was probably the origin of my tendency to prefer to watch games before actually playing them myself). While they played, I looked over the rule book, and found out about the dungeon maps, and perhaps even the mention that you could play with miniatures.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, I was interested. I ended up staying up all night reading the rules. And changing them before we even played the first time (coming from a wargaming background, it didn't make sense that all weapons did the same damage). The next morning, the others created new characters, and ventured into the dungeon. We sat in the back of the station wagon (this was before seat belt laws) as we rode to Battleship Cove (for the main activity of the birthday) and played. By the end of the day, I think we had run through two or three sets of characters (getting them up to third level and retiring them).<br/>
<br/>
Certainly one of the things that sold me on the game was all this talk of not really winning, and the cooperative nature of the game. Of course I soon discovered that the only way to guarantee that kind of game was to be GM.<br/>

                            Technically, my first RPGs were playing Superheroes on the playground at school and making new stories with my Star Wars action figures, who all had new names and roles, too--Luke was something like Jack Starcatcher, my stormtrooper was his cyborg half-brother (a good guy), and my jawa was a whimsical Jedi master who used to Force to fly around (like Yoda in Episode II, but before "Empire" had even come out).<br/><br/>But my first time with "real" RPGs was when I slept over at a friend's house in 4th grade (1980). He helped me make a dwarf fighter, then ran me through module B1. That room with all of the pools? I drank from each and every one, until one of them killed me. It was fun.<br/><br/>But I agree that the D&amp;D books promised cool, high adventure and didn't initially deliver. I grew increasingly frustrated, because what I wanted was high-level fantasy adventure stories, but what I got was low-level drudgery (unless I made a character and promoted him to higher levels). I had fun playing with my friends, but it seemed like every game we played (D&amp;D, Boot Hill, Gamma World, Traveller, Top Secret) denied you the ability to play epic heroes in high-level adventures.                        </div>

                            The first game I played was Traveller.  I was coming out of swim practice at the "Y" and the locker key guy was playing with a buddy of his.<br/>

I must have been around 11, so this was something like 1977.<br/>

                            This is a story about GM fiat, and just how far it goes.<br/><br/>I was about eight or nine, so it must have been 1985 or 1986, when I went over to an older friend's house.  I had just read the Lord of the Rings for the first time, so when he said that we could play a game kind of like it, I was hooked.  I made a female human neutral good cleric and spent about an hour reading all the spells and going, "Whoa!  Cool!"  Then the party leader told me that I wasn't supposed to cast anything but healing spells, and I got really mad at him and told the group that if anyone was mean to me, I'd let their character die.  That shut them up quick.  We didn't actually get to play that session, though, so it didn't make a difference.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I took that character to camp with me that summer, where the morning activities were voluntary and you could sign up for whichever ones you wanted.  On the strength of that one not-quite-session, I signed up for D&amp;D.  We ran through what I'm fairly sure was "Desert of Desolation," though the GM never let us see the book he was running from.  I had a great time running around, smiting things with my mace, and rescuing the party left and right. <br/><br/>The other kids were all guys and were mostly eleven or twelve, and the GM was maybe fourteen, so a certain amount of raucousness was inevitable.  Unfortunately, one of the other players decided it would be fun for his character to have sex with mine.  I was eight, so I didn't even know what sex was - and then this guy describes his character sneaking into the tent and getting it on with mine.  I got really angry and started shouting about how it was SO GROSS and how I wanted to have woken up when he came in and killed him with my mace.  He started shouting back about how sneaky his character was.  The GM stepped in and said that he was the GM, and that my character had (EW!) sex, and that's how it was.  I said, "Nuh uh, you can't make me do that."  He said, "Yeah, I can too."  And that's how I ended up in a fist-fight with the GM during the very first session I ever played. <br/><br/>For the record, he beat the crap out of me (being several years older and much more fit), but he decided that because I cared so much about it, my character could kill the other PC before having to have sex with him.  So the GM and this other guy and I - with my black eye - sat down to roll up a new character for him.<br/><br/>This might have scared other girls away, but fortunately I'm a feisty bitch and I came back the next day raring for more.  None of those boys messed with me ever again!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>I think I was four or five -- my memory is pretty hazy because it was before I started kindergarten and all those years kinda blend together for me.  1985-1986 sometime.</p>
<p>My brother had played D&amp;D (red box) in an after-school program.  He was really excited about it, so he ran my mom and I through the adventure in the book -- the one with the rust monster.  My mom was a warrior woman and I was a halfling named "no name" because I couldn't come up with a name.  I have no memory of it except it was really fun.</p>
<p>The next time I played was really traumatic, but too long for me to write right now.</p>
<p>This is totally unconnected from my imaginative play, which I was doing throughout that time and often had highly structured rules, processes, and systems.  None of us had any idea that our pretend-play was anything like D&amp;D, <em>'cause it wasn't anything like D&amp;D</em>.  Only in my 20s did I even begin to consider make-believe to be the same category as RPGs.  I'm increasingly distrustful of this claim these days, anyway.</p>

I must have been 7 or 8. My folks, English grandparents and me and my brother went over to spain to visit my dad's family, and I got everybody to play the Riddling Reaver campaign. I was the GM. Everyone was somewhat bemused by this little kid coordinating an evening's entertainment, but I actually had a pretty good handle on it. I must have known that (admittedly simple) system better than almost any other body of knowledge, through the choose-yer-adventure precursors and obsessive rereading of the rule and setting books.<br/><br/>God, major nostalgia for that setting....                        </div>

                            I started off with the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy_Game_Books" rel="nofollow"><i>Fighting Fantasy</i></a> solo gamebooks that we had in the school library in 1985ish too. I think my first was <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_Fighter" rel="nofollow"><i>Freeway Fighter</i></a>. I remember getting the <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> and the <i>The Riddling Reaver</i> books too, and wondering how they worked - multi players?<br/>
<br/>
Never actually got to play them because I saw the Marvel Super Heroes games in Toys 'R Us soon afterward. As an avid reader of Spiderman comics, I wanted the "Advanced" set <i>right now</i>, but my parents would only get me the Basic set after a lot of pestering. I managed to get a few friends up for playing the introductory adventure a few days later, which went down a storm. I completely forgot to give the baddies attacks against the heroes, however, as we were all loving having Spiderman, the Thing, etc. (as they just took hold of the pregen characters) smacking hell out of Doc Octopus' giant robot! It also set me up to be a GM for a few years, until we moved house and moved next door to a gamer (and older guy who taught me classic Traveller) and we found an actual club to join, and play <i>loads</i> of cool games.                        </div>

                            My RPG play has, for the most part, had very little to do with my childhood make-believe play. It's only very recently that I've decided that it was bad that the two were so dissimilar, and I've been trying to rectify that.<br/><br/>If most RPGs are written to be an adult equivalent of childhood make-believe play, I think they're done very, very badly.                        </div>

                            Since I ended up running RPGs at least three years before I ever played one, I can't say I remember the first time I played. However, I do remember the first few times I ran one. <br/><br/>The first was a D&amp;D adventure for my family, in place of our normal New Year's Eve boardgame. I don't recall much of that game, and it didn't make much of an impression on them either. <br/><br/>My first protracted game was an over-the-phone game of D&amp;D I ran for almost a year. Pretty quickly I had morphed D&amp;D into a game where my response to player input was to keep things interesting and fair. If I didn't trust myself to come up with that on my own, I used a d20 to decide between positive and negative outcomes. If I recall at one point during that game I even made a geneology chart for the ruling family of a kingdom, and ran for several months using that essentially as a relationship map. <br/><br/>I'm still not sure how I got from reading D&amp;D DM advice to the idea that the DM should be responsive to players ideas, and should offer players opportunities, rather than force them into situations. That's pretty much affected my playing and running of RPGs ever since. Perhaps that is why when I first encountered Mo's post on push and pull I immediately thought: push = players, pull = GM. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Hardcore?  Yes, but the downside of my story is that I had to spend most of the next four years convincing my parents that I wasn't going to come home from EVERY D&amp;D session with a black eye ....<br/><br/>As for the make-believe thing, my experiences playing D&amp;D were actually quite close to my make-believe play, except that when I played D&amp;D I was always a player while in my imaginary games I would lead my sisters and brother in exciting adventures.  We didn't have a dice-based resolution system, but we did go on quests and all that.  For about two years we had an ongoing game where we'd pretend to be the Voltron characters, for example.  The conflict resolution system was spinning around until you got dizzy; the person who fell down last was the winner.  Don't ask me where in the world that came from, except that I seemed to lean toward very physical systems when I was a little kid.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>With imaginative play, there were also the Barbie vs. He-Man wars (Barbie always won, since she had the stuffed animals on her side) which had definite similarities to D&amp;D, and the endless games of Star Wars figurines where we did the voices and made up new stories for them, and, well, lots of other stuff ....<br/><br/>After I got boobs and the boys wouldn't play with me anymore (a sad state which lasted until college, when the boobs became an asset again), D&amp;D was actually the center of my imaginative life for a while.  I "borrowed" the core books from our old GM and read them over and over in the privacy of my room, and made up adventures for myself.  I had no idea there were other games out there, or where to buy my own books (and even if I'd known how to do it, my parents weren't exactly supportive after the black eye incident!) so I practically wore through the spine of the four books that I had.  I spent literally hours dreaming over them, the way some girls dreamed over <i>Seventeen</i> magazine.<br/><br/>For the record, though, my parents now think that my role-playing research is "cool" and "cutting edge."  I ran a session for my dad and sisters for the first time last month, which was scary as all fuck but totally worthwhile.  Next time I'm going to get my mom and my brother in on the act!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            My first time with an RPG was also D&amp;D, but was 3.5!  (No, I haven't been playing long....)  There were only two characters: an elf and a dwarf.  My elf had to keep saving the dwarf who would do things like climb a tree to get better shots at the enemy and then get shot and fall out of the tree!  The best part about the game was that the GM was willing to play fast and loose with what spells could do; for example, 'grease' could grease anything, not just an area, etc..  We ended up blowing up a town we were trying to save from the air elementals that had invaded the (dry) canal.  I had the brilliant idea of throwing in a fireball, but there was a portal to the dimension of air and things went BOOM!  It was fun.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My parents have generally approved of my gaming, since my Dad still had the original AD&amp;D books out in the garage with his 32-level wizard inside....  :P<br/>

                            I've told this story somewhere else before, but it was Boxing Day, 1980; the day after I'd got this from my Nana for Christmas:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://knights-n-knaves.com/images/Basic5th.jpg"/><br/><br/>I gathered Josh, Jonathon, Gary, and my brother Dave, and we started playing the Caves of Chaos (I took a look at the Keep and couldn't quite figure out what to do with it, though it looked intriguing). I learnt the lesson of ill-conceived house-rules in my first game ever--the 'berserk' rule I'd cooked up overnight destroyed several caverns of kobolds and orcs.<br/><br/>The chits that came with that edition were a pain in the arse. The next day I went into the city and purchased a set of polyhedral dice. But I was pretty much hooked on the idea. I'd also noticed that nobody much was eager to GM....<br/><br/>We played the hell out of D&amp;D and AD&amp;D for the next twelve months. Josh and Jonathon dropped out, and Danny, Anthony, Martin and Adam (Gary's bro) dropped in. We played around with <i>Traveller</i>, <i>Universe</i>, V&amp;V and even <i>Land of the Rising Sun</i>, but finally I fell for this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.glorantha.info/runequest/chaosium/rqrules/rq2rb.jpg"/><br/><br/>...and ended up running it for about fifteen years, but that's another story....                        </div>
