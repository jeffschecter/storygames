Not "hang underneath a fabric frame billowing on the wind," (no offense to people who love hang-gliding) or "sit inside a cabin and jimmy with controls" (no offense to people who love piloting aircraft) ... I want to <i>fly</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my imagination the airship isn't a separate thing, keeping me aloft.  I pull <i>it</i> through the sky.  I kick, and its engines thrust, I lean and its wings bank.  In my imagination I <i>carry</i> the airship, and I can fly, and it is like the memory of a deep breath of clear air that sustains me as I choke and gasp in a narrow, smoky place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow.

I'm sure I'm just reiterating what's been said, but...<br/>\n<br/>\nNostalgia: Age of sail is glamorized to the point where even the badguys (pirates) get to be lovable action/adventure heroes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlight: Flying's just badass. It's also so much cooler with an open deck. There's a panoramic view. And it says alot about your character to even be able to stand up without a sense of vertigo.<br/>\n<br/>\nPirates: I reiterate the pirates thing, but compared to scifi ship combat, open-deck to open-deck is more exciting and has the potential to keep characters (besides just pilots, technicians, and turret-gunners) involved. Not that there's anything at all wrong with the pilots, technicians, and turret-gunners thing... just... y'know... it isn't as badass as boarding followed by melee, with people being thrown off and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nFantasy: It's one of the "best of fantasy" moments. It doesn't have to make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nScifi: It's also the best of scifi... the exploring new places bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some downer bits. What happens if you fall, for example. Totally worth it, though... whatever they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125678/#Comment_125678" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T02:45:17+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  2:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other day I was reading Burning Wheel Revised, and looking at the lifepaths. While reading the seafaring one, I realized that if you replaced all instances of "sea" with "sky", it pretty much perfectly translates over into airships, with only a few quirks, the explanation of which leads to entertaining places. Like the Ship's Chaplain who now secretly worships the Black Sky God instead of the Black Sea God. Replace the 'bilge-drinker' trait with 'bilge-breather', and then figure out what airship bilge is. What do galley slaves row? Giant paper-fan-like wings! An interesting if immoral alternative to sails, certainly. I still haven't figured out what to call "Marines" yet, though. "Aerials"? And other stuff like that. It's awesome how many of the roles important to a normal ocean-going vessel are just as important in a skyfaring one, though.<br/><br/>It really made me want to play a fantasy game with airships, which reminded me of this thread, hence the necro.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125699/#Comment_125699" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T05:52:13+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  5:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And again ... because they are COOL!<br/><br/>Also they are a bit creepy, well the ones in the Golden Compass movie were.<br/><br/>For me, though, the biggest thing is that they are manageably slow, while comfortable and elegant.

I think the thread is supposed to be about the former, but I'm not at all sure:<br/>\n<br/>\nDirigibles - Blimps, Zepplins. These are fanciful, I think, for one reason: they're absurd. Think about the concept. We'll keep this vehicle aloft not through any sort of propulsion, but instead by attaching it to a bag of something that is - on average - lighter than air. Said bag of air will therefore have to be many times the size of the thing carried. Creating a contraption that, while functional, is quite lumbering and ridiculous in appearance. Basically a concept of this sort is simply quite audacious, rejecting any notion of normality for the functionality of being able to fly. How romantic is that? <br/>\n<br/>\nSailing Ships in the Sky - Take a more or less normal sailing ship, enchant it somehow so that it levitates, and... well of course it operates just like it would in the water (except with a third dimension to deal with)! Just smacks of magic, so it's attractive for that alone. To say nothing of compounding the romance of flight with the romance of sea-travel. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, neither of these things has had a rise popularity in RPGs "all of a sudden" recently. They have always been quite prominent, and never have gone down in prominence. In point of fact, I'm having a hard time thinking of any fantasy RPG environment that didn't have one, or the other, or both:<br/>\n<br/>\nGlorantha: Moonboats (probably has blimps somewhere, too) - these may predate RPGs, I don't know<br/>\nShadow World: Skyships and Airbarges<br/>\nJorune: What would the "Skyrealms" be without Burdothian skyships, and Crystal Schooners?<br/>\nTalislanta: Windships<br/>\nEarthdawn: Sky Galleons driven by Troll Raiders, combatting the old empire full of airships (at Sky Point, of course!)<br/>\nChildren of the Sun: Steampunkish blimps<br/>\nFinal Fantasy (Every Edition): Blimps and airships galore<br/>\nWorld of Warcraft: How come only the Horde get Airships!!!<br/>\nOther CRPGs: http://serpent231.tripod.com/cliche.shtml (See the entry on Airships)<br/>\nSpace 1889 (pub 1988): Dirigibles are part and parcel of this early Steampunk adopter<br/>\nEvery Supers RPG: has a villain with a dirigible stronghold or something. I seem to recall something in Villains &amp; Vigilantes...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lest we think that D&amp;D didn't have such until Spelljammer arrived in 1989, or Forgotten Realms had their Halruaan skyships, and such (like, duh, Eberron), I believe that Tekumel - the first D&amp;D setting published - had some sort of airships (it had spaceships, so I think airships are no stretch). <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose Call of Cthulhu doesn't count? Since it's historical and it would be odd to disclude dirigibles from that time-period? Or Traveller that has "Lighter Than Air Craft Piloting" in most editions (they're just being technological completists)? <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, sure, Chivalry &amp; Sorcery didn't have em, nor did Harn (that I recall). But those were "realistic" and "medieval" and so wouldn't, would they. Pretty much every other fantasy game has these, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is about as "all of a sudden" as the recent popularity of ice cream. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128906/#Comment_128906" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T21:07:55+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, like Mike, am scratching my head at this "all of a sudden" thing. My airship-love is as old as Final Fantasy VII, and I'm sure would've stretched back farther if I'd owned a Super Nintendo as a kid.<br/><br/>To me, Airships are definitely Freedom, Baby. Y'notice, if you play the old Final Fantasys when you get the airship the worldmap music switches over to this "boundless horizons, soaring free from a single care" kinda theme? That's part and parcel to the Airship thing for me.<br/><br/>It's funny, I had an RPG character gathering dust, created for an abortive BESM campaign that was billed as "Chinese political fantasy, with airships." So naturally I made an unflappable and flambouyant Air Pirate. Well, the same GM recently asked me if I'd like to join her D&amp;D game, and practically begged me to port over the Pirate dude and play him. So I did, though he felt kinda. . .bogged down by the D&amp;D character creation structure. And of course I've got this airship. Only, instead of catapulting me into rapturous flights of boundless adventure, it's sitting outside of town camoflauged with some tarm and tree branches. 'Cause y'see, it's a sitting duck soaring over the town, and there's a gaggle of Mages peppering the city who'd send it down in a fiery wreck in about two minutes. . .<br/><br/>Funnily enough, the GM let slip a bit ago that she had the idea that the airship would become a handy mobile adventuring base for the PCs once they formed a "party." So it sounds like she's taking her cues from FF in a more utilitarian way. And of course, if you play the FF games, the roguish air-captain always has a heart of gold and hitches his sail to the Heroes' Cause.* But that's not exactly what I desined the character for. Lin Baolong just wants to be <i>freeeee</i>. . .<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*To be fair, though, bear in mind that no AP anecdote tells the whole story, there are other dimensions of the game that are quite satisfying (like getting my Lupin on in a rich and gullible city), and the GM and I are talking about our expectations in a healthy manner and collaborating on creating a fulfilling experience for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128911/#Comment_128911" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T21:17:21+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:17PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the piano bar that makes airships awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128983/#Comment_128983" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T06:09:56+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>It's the piano bar that makes airships awesome.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>It certainly doesn't hurt.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff" title="joshua neff"><img alt="joshua neff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.goblin-cartoons.com/images/lantern.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff">joshua neff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128998/#Comment_128998" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T06:45:16+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>It's the piano bar that makes airships awesome.</blockquote>\nYes.
