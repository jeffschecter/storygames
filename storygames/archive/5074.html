Now, the group knows that they need to go through the Khalean Jungles safely the next day, and the Goblin lacks any helpful ability. He  refreshes vigor by going after his addiction - say he stuffs himself with hot peppers until steam comes out of his ears, and being in this goblin-specific state of bliss, happily blowing steam out of his ears, *something* happens: His hearing increases up to a point where it will help him navigating the woods with bat-like ease, he grows a small pouch where he can put his peppers, his arms elongate so he can more easily swing from tree to tree - in other words, he changes into a nocturnal marsupial goblin, which mechanically is expressed by setting the woodscraft ability to Master Level. The Adaptability Ability goes down to unskilled; since the goblinoid body is not as malleable as some people believe, it will take some time until a new change comes away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it works the other way around, as well: All the night vision and long arms don't help that much if the superstitious people from Oran think of you as a demonic being, and since you need to help your friend who is in love with you, you need to take on some  more inconspicious features. A round of peppers and a bit of ear steaming action later, the woodscraft ability goes down to 0 again, and face and arms lose some of their inhuman feature. Maybe shifting the master level around to sway or orate is the next thing to do....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, there is a bit of discussion about Secret and Ability of Adaptability on the forge: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24258.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24258.0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114687/#Comment_114687" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-16T21:25:25+00:00" title="December 16, 2007  9:25PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, I've seen the thread at The Forge, but wasn't clarifiying much.
