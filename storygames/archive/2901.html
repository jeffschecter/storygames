I love Story Games and love the ideas behind the Forge. I love Game Chef.<br/><br/>But, as far as I can tell, I'm not the best at solo game design. Would anyone be interested in a joint venture?<br/><br/>If you're interested, whisper me your email address. If you're interested but want to discuss specifics, post here.<br/><br/>I stole (and edited) this idea (to start with) from Robin Laws' <a href="http://robin-d-laws.livejournal.com/205202.html" rel="nofollow">Livejournal</a>:<br/><br/>Gigantic dungeon complex full of treasure found in isolated wilderness. Adventurers travel from all over to plunder it, setting up bustling lawless town. PCs are both adventurers and the leading figures of the town, who struggle to skim its wealth and harness its nascent political power.<br/><br/>Everything else to be decided during creation.<br/><br/>If anyone has a different idea, please post it here. Be willing to be a collector of emails. The idea is to form a committee for a specific goal and see if your committee can work towards it. There is no inherent competition involved in this (at least on my side of things).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66309/#Comment_66309" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T08:18:59+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  8:18AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, we have enough to start this project.
