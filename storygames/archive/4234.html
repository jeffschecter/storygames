We're playing in the Planescape universe, hence the name Revisionist Planescape. Here's the game's <a href="http://lokasenna.pe.kr/wiki/planescape_pbw/" rel="nofollow">wiki page</a>, though you won't make much of the actual content unless you read Korean. <br/><br/>I think the most fun thing about playing this game is riffing off each other's articles. The current game is about an event in Sigil, christened The Breakthrough, where Baatezu and Tanar'ri hordes got through the Lady of Pain's defenses for one day and battled for control of Sigil. On that day one Githzerai and one Githyanki died fighting the fiends together. We started with that sparse (but loaded) premise, and soon the articles started building on each other to form a big, exciting story. <br/><br/>For example, one player wrote about how Marraken and Ris'a'n, the Giths in question, killed a Tanar'ri lord during the battle. Another wrote that Ris'a'n's father had been morphed into an Illithid and she was tracking him for this reason. I looked at those articles and wrote one where the Tanar'ri lord long ago received a prophecy from three Night Hags that he could never die unless slain by a Githzerai and a Githyanki working together. I wrote a follow-up where the Tanar'ri decided, bloodthirsty fiend that he is (no, really), that he would simply exterminate all Githzerai and Githyanki and live forever. The demon lord makes an offer to the Illithid: The Tanar'ri will exterminate the Gith races if the Illithid help them get Sigil. (Yes, I'm setting up for a classic self-fulfilling prophecy. Everyone else seems on board with the idea, too, so I expect no challenges.) Only this particular mind flayer is the same one Ris'a'n's was tracking, so she overhears this conference and becomes drawn into the events that led to The Breakthrough... and so on. <br/><br/>Of course, the articles don't always build on each other; sometimes they knock each other down via the challenge rules. We've had three challenge auctions so far, with the results reflected in the "summary of discoveries" list under the articles chart at the top of the wiki page--the "disproved" discoveries are crossed out on that list. <br/><br/>The challenge rule tends to shape gaming decisions even when it's not in active use. I might not like another player's article about possible romantic feelings between two of the main subjects, but am I willing to risk the loss of research tokens and/or credibility ratings to change that? Or I might want to write an article about how Marraken and Ris'a'n weren't so heroic after all, but I'm pretty sure another researcher will challenge it, so again I have to weigh the risk against the benefit. The possibility of challenge is always in the participants' minds, whether the rules are currently in use or not. <br/><br/>Another interesting effect of the challenge rule is that competitive pressure acts as an incentive to keep writing. Long-term participation can be problematic in a free participation game like play-by-wiki, and the need to build up credibility and tokens to keep the story your way acts as the systematic pressure to keep writing. There's also the sheer fun of keeping up, keeping a lead, or being determined to catch up. <br/><br/>Unfortunately there's also some pressure to write short, quick articles rather than long, well-considered ones, since tokens and credibility pile up by article regardless of length or quality. Still, there's some self-policing at work since everyone knows they're going to get called out if they get too blatant about writing crappy articles just for the in-game tokens. This is also one of the considerations that made us decide on a 48-hour play period rather than the default day. One other system that's helping is the discovery summary list, mentioned above. Since everyone updates the list after writing an article, at the bare minimum every article has some kind of articulable conclusion. <br/><br/>One other house rule we added was that players could also earn one research token for writing a diary entry for the researcher. Only the play period for this diary entry is one week, and the diary entry gives no opportunity to invest the token into a credibility rating. The play period for the diary runs separate from the articles, so no one has to make a choice between writing an article or a diary entry for a given play period. And because the reward for a diary entry is relatively small while the play period is long, the system encourages character exposition for the researchers without completely altering the balance of the game in favor of  diary-keeping instead of research. <br/><br/>The diary entry rule added a new dimension to the game, because not only does it bring out the researchers as characters in their own right, the players are also weaving the researchers' stories together in new ways. For instance, our current batch of researcher diary entries all fall on a single day--"Sigil Day," which is the anniversary of the fiend incursion they're all researching. We get different perspectives on that one day from different perspectives, which is a lot of fun. <br/><br/>A final matter of note is how wiki technology facilitates the game. I've given everyone the same editing privileges so everyone can make changes, from routine stuff like writing articles and updating the article chart to improvements like changing the structure of the main page. To some extent it's a simple matter of administrability, even sanity since I would be overwhelmed if I had to make all these little changes. in another respect, though, it's a very egalitarian structure that emphasizes the GM-less, cooperative/competitive nature of the game itself. <br/><br/>Other great little stuff about the wiki include a plugin that adds a discussion box to the bottom of the wiki pages so we can have discussions and make comments without editing wiki pages (I will forever adore the person who wrote that plugin; I swear it's the most useful plugin in wiki history), a feed export feature that enables tracking of recent edits and comments, a rich but simple formatting syntax for making attractive and well-structured pages, and a version tracker that is indispensible for correcting and preventing mistakes. It really goes to show how technology can help gaming, especially in an online environment that's completely dependent on technology. <br/><br/>So that's my playtest report. I've translated Revisionist History into Korean and written about the Revisionist Planescape game on my blog, and it's generated quite a bit of interest in the Korean online RPG community. Asynchronous gaming has definite advantages when it comes to time efficiency, and RH is one of those rare games specifically designed for an asynchronous environment. In my experience it works very well, and could be especially fun for us creative writing types that the hobby seems to attract so many of.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94921/#Comment_94921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T20:20:31+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  8:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap.

I got such a... hmmm... designers rush (I guess?) when I read your post above.  I haven't done much designing but it is <b>so cool</b> to have people playing and enjoying what you wrote.  So thanks for that, it makes me very happy!  It was the best part of my day yesterday.  (If this is how all you other designers feel about people playing your game, I can see why you do it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the house rule on diary entries and how you've adjusted it to the economy, brilliant!  I so wish I could read Korean to see what you guys have done (I looked at a translated page but, well, it looses something <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  .<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a couple questions I have<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you guys know each other or interact outside of the internet?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is that wiki software you guys are using, is it Korean only?<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the end game is weak with the whole "when everyone is happy with the story, stop."  It doesn't seem to fit with all that resource management earlier.  I had  a Mechaton style doomsday clock rule where you basically set the number of rounds (I was thinking of one round of articles as like a quarterly journal) and count down the clock every round with optional countdown by the players as well.  I also refined another system, that you suggested by email, where everyone spends tokens to submit research questions that must be answered before the game ends. 1 token per question (and you would probably start with a base of oh, two questions from every player?) Once all questions have been answered the game is over.  Maybe we could tie research questions to diary entries.  (As in they must be raised in diary entries.) Hmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm wrong on this, and it will be interesting to see you guys play it out.  If you're playing with the original rule, do you like that freedom of no hard ending point?  My reason for adding it, besides to be more in the spirit of the previous mechanics, is to fight the general entropy of the internet. I think it is one of the great banes of PbP play. If something feels like it can go on forever, I often loose energy to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.  Wow.  Thanks for playing Jee.  I hope you and your buddies will be kind enough to comment on the system for me when the experience is over, or really anytime.  This is a great start.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevis<br/>\n<br/>\n(Crucifying Elminster, Ha!  I remember that show.  And thanks Lenny!  That means even more to me after meeting you at GenCon during Ron's little talk there.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95491/#Comment_95491" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T11:28:08+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 11:28AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Trevis Martin</cite><br>Do you guys know each other or interact outside of the internet?</br></blockquote>\nNo, we met via online RPGs and only know each other online. \n<blockquote>What is that wiki software you guys are using, is it Korean only?</blockquote>\nIt's <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki" rel="nofollow">DokuWiki</a>. Its default language is English but it supports UTF-8 and is fairly well internationalized, though I'd say not as well documented and supported as the more famous MediaWiki, the other major UTF-8 supporting wiki at the time I was wiki-shopping. With a great ACL Dokuwiki works better for closed wikis and has a cleaner interface, which is why I prefer it for gaming purposes, though I'd say MediaWiki would be superior for big, open wikis. MediaWiki also used to enjoy a sizable speed advantage, but the recent version of DokuWiki caught up in that respect since it used caching or whatever it is that's beyond my understanding. \n<blockquote>I feel the end game is weak with the whole "when everyone is happy with the story, stop."  It doesn't seem to fit with all that resource management earlier.</blockquote>\nIt's not a bad rule (if it's a rule at all) in itself, but I do agree that there's no in-game mechanism for resolving how "done" the research is. I realized this a few days ago when I mentioned, offhand, that we appeared to be almost done with the current game. Another player surprised me by saying that he thought we were just getting started! So a more elaborate endgame rule might definitely be in order, especially since the game is getting bigger with the addition of more research subjects. \n<blockquote>Maybe I'm wrong on this, and it will be interesting to see you guys play it out.

We're having a messenger chat to discuss the game tomorrow and I plan to bring up the issue of endgame rules. I'm not sure of either the doomsday countdown or the questions-answered approach, the former seems too absolute a time limit while the latter seems restricting. It'll be interesting to see what the we can come up with as a committee. \n<blockquote>Anyway.  Wow.  Thanks for playing Jee.

We're having a lot of fun playing it. I'll ask for comments, whether during the game or after, and put them up in addition to my own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259861/#Comment_259861" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T08:37:10+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  8:37AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Total thread necro here, but I just discovered this game from somewhere or other (one of those links you click, bookmark for later, then come back to after a year and wonder where on earth it came from).
