(I'm reading <i>Contenders</i> now, for example.) Is this always the best way to do it?<br/><br/>In particular, I'll be running the game in a one-shot environment where people are learning the rules. Given the slight time pressure, I wonder if it might be better to tell one character's story at a time, or at least go far (like up to half-way through one character's story) before cutting away to give that character a break.<br/><br/>Of course, this makes it harder to fit in the multiple threaded intertwining stories, but it allows more focus on single threads and a greater chance of seeing one complete if you don't have an unbounded evening's worth of time.

So if you want to tell a longer story focusing on one character without cutting away, it really needs mechanisms to engage everyone at the table to sustain the fun.  I think so, at least.  This isn't a hard-and-fast thing (screen presence in PTA requires patience and delayed gratification and supporting your fellow players, for example), but I think it's worth considering.  <br/><br/>One intermediary step is to encourage the interruption of scenes with flashbacks, bobs, weaves, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77461/#Comment_77461" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T10:21:32+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 10:21AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll second Jason's comment. <i>Ganakagok</i> passes the spotlight around the table in the way that you're talking about, but people tell me that they stay engaged as players even when the spotlight isn't on them. One reason for this is that they have in-game resources that they can invoke to affect the outcome of the other player's scene (perhaps via a rationalizing flashback, as Jason suggests). Another, more subtle reason is the extent to which players' individual scenes contribute to an overarching narrative, so that earlier events are worth paying attention to as grist for narration when your turn comes around. In other words, to the extent that each character's individual story contributes to a larger narrative (even if that larger narrative is disjointed and weirdly articulated, like <b><i>Pulp Fiction</i></b>), player interest in <i>each other's stories</i> is heightened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77475/#Comment_77475" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T10:51:56+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 10:51AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are the positive upsides to even-handedly passing of the spotlight, but what about turns of 5-scenes or so, rather than 1-scene?

What does 5-scenes in a row, rather than 1-scene in a row, do /enough/ better that tracking how many scenes in a row have happened is something I should be concerned about?<br/><br/>I like looking at new different ways of narration trading.  Ensemble is a lot about that.  Fastlane's first edition had some, and its 2nd edition will have more.  How spotlights are handled are very important to me as a play resource.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77512/#Comment_77512" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T13:49:36+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  1:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Has anyone had experience with that, or just understood the desire to do so?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Oh sure, but I absolutely wouldn't do it except in a group that's totally die-hard committed to long term play, because spotlight time will be hella harder to equalise.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
