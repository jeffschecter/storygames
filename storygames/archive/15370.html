Here you go:<br/><br/>Other Worlds is a rules-light storygame that focuses on group worldbuilding, genre emulation, and character issues.<br/><br/>You spend the first session brainstorming up the setting and building the characters. PCs in Other Worlds tend to be very detailed, with a strong emphasis on their goals, flaws, personality traits, and relationships, as well as the innate tension between their cultural and professional baggage and their own sense of individuality. Then when you start playing there are ways for players to add new details to the setting and gain new abilities for their characters as a result. So the characters and the setting have kind of a symbiotic relationship with each other. <br/><br/>Mechanically Other Worlds uses a fairly straightforward method of conflict resolution, with a single opposed roll handling most situations quickly and easily. Each conflict roll either gives a flaw to the loser or a temporary ability to the winner, so characters change and grow as the game progresses. Players can also use Spotlight Points to raise the stakes of a conflict or give their character more screen time in it, and there is a more detailed Set Pieces system to handle the really important conflicts of a story. <br/><br/>The book itself also contains loads of play examples and character templates, six illustrated campaign outlines, an extensive GM advice chapter, a detailed guide to adapting Other Worlds to different genres and settings, and quick-start genre snapshots for six different genres - fantasy, horror, pirates, space opera, superheroes, and the wild west. <br/><br/>Finally, we've got a wonderfully clean and elegant layout courtesy of Fred Hicks, and lots of beautiful pencil sketches courtesy of Storn Cook.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I've set up a facebook page for Other Worlds now for anyone that wants to know more: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Other-Worlds/162776777151618" rel="nofollow">Other Worlds facebook</a> Or ask here, of course!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349138/#Comment_349138" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-17T17:20:02+00:00" title="November 17, 2011  5:20PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2011 5:30PM by soviet.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: KynnBartlett</cite>That's a pretty awesome cover.</blockquote>\nThanks!

I know it's similar to Heroquest, but how's it different?</blockquote>\nI think ultimately Other Worlds is an attempt to marry the core concepts of HeroQuest 1 (one roll resolution, augments, and characters as lists of descriptors rather than numbers) with more 'storygame'-style ideas about group worldbuilding, overt conflict resolution, bang-driven play, and general player empowerment. <br/><br/>If you already played HeroQuest in this kind of way (the 'Holmesian interpretation', as I like to call it), I think you will find Other Worlds is simply a better tool for the same job. If you're new to this kind of play then I hope that Other Worlds offers a very clear explanation of how to do it - there are detailed play examples running all the way through the text, and dedicated chapters on Playing Other Worlds, GMing Other Worlds, and Adapting Other Worlds to different genres, as well as lots of other 'story now' inclined sidebars scattered throughout the book. <br/><br/>While the basic engine is recognisably HQ-inspired, I think it's also much more effective as a resolution mechanic: the process of setting stakes is more clearly defined, augments are more important, flaws/injuries and temporary bonuses are tied directly into the basic abilities system, and the overall results are more dynamic (HQ conflicts always seemed to just end in a partial victory, which may be more realistic but it sure isn't more exciting).<br/><br/>The basic procedure is as follows:<br/><br/>Player describes actions and declares goals<br/>Player and GM agree failure stakes<br/><br/>Group allocates screen time - i.e. should this be an automatic success, a single opposed roll, or a more detailed series of rolls called a set piece?<br/><br/>Player chooses a base ability and uses its full rating<br/>Player chooses up to 3 supporting abilities - the first adds 50% of its rating, the others add 10%<br/>(Player can spend a spotlight point to 'go all in' and use as many supporting abilities as he can justify)<br/>GM and player determine applicable negative traits (flaws, injuries, etc)  - the first subtracts 50% of its rating, the others subtract 10%<br/>GM applies other modifiers based on circumstances and the nature of the ability used<br/><br/>GM determines opposition rating<br/><br/>Both sides roll d100 and add their total rating: highest wins, with three different victory levels<br/>(Player may spend a spotlight point to reverse the tens and ones dice, or escalate his failure stakes and reroll)<br/><br/>GM may <b>either</b> give the winning side a temporary ability as a bonus (lasts one session) <b>or</b> give the losing side a flaw as a penalty (duration depends on severity of the defeat - critical defeats also carry an extra penalty called a restriction)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350212/#Comment_350212" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T17:05:11+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  5:05PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I wanted to ask people here what kind of additional options they would like to see in terms of the actual release.<br/><br/>You'll be able to get it in print (8.5x11 softcover, 208 pages) and PDF.

Hopefully this will be sometime next week. <br/><br/>Thanks for your interest!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352045/#Comment_352045" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T13:18:58+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  1:18PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2011 2:39PM by soviet.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other Worlds Released!<br/><br/>I'm pleased to announce that the Other Worlds PDF is now available from RPGNow, price $14.99.

This is a topic I've been thinking about recently in terms of possible demonstration games. I think there's basically two ways to do it. <br/><br/>The first way is to choose the archetypes and trademarks in advance, but leave the individuality (including goals and flaws) to the player. This lets you cover the bases you need in terms of character concepts but also give players the chance to put their own spin on things. What's more, they'll be able to make up these abilities during play itself, using the abilities they already have as a guideline for what's acceptable. And if at certain points in the game you pause and ask people if they want to define their relationship to a particular NPC, or whatever, then so much the better!<br/><br/>The other way is to take advantage of the modular nature of the templates. Print out all the templates from your chosen genre snapshot onto little index cards or slips of paper, and get people to choose one from each pile (or just deal them out at random). These can either be stapled directly onto the character sheet or held in hand. Then let people choose individuality stuff as above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352836/#Comment_352836" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-30T14:12:54+00:00" title="December 30, 2011  2:12PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed reading the pdf.

The prose is lucid and colorful, the system strikes me as (in essence) a streamlined variation on Heroquest, but with different switches.  The support material and examples are really helpful.<br/><br/>I was wondering how much, if at all, in-game handling time is affected by players scouring their sheets for supporting abilities to apply.  One of the signal complaints of HQ1 was that conflicts often stalled while players hunted for augments.  When I played HQ1 and 2, choosing augments proved to slow things down pretty consistently.  With the greater number of abilities in OW, I'm curious whether this has been an issue, and if so, how you addressed it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352948/#Comment_352948" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T05:59:40+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  5:59AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!<br/><br/>In my experience finding supporting abilities doesn't take up a lot of time. The normal limit of 3 supporting abilities per conflict does a lot of the heavy lifting here, and players have so many abilities that they can generally find those 3 very quickly. The interesting part moves from 'how many can I find?' to 'which 3 shall I use?'.<br/><br/>I also find that even when they spend the point to Go All In, my players are a little less anxious to find every last bonus than they used to be with HQ. The 50%/10% progression helps here, because it lets people know pretty clearly that these last few dregs are not really very significant and aren't likely to make much difference to the actual result. Further, I find that between explicit stake setting and the spotlight point you get for losing a conflict (or doing something fun, as per the feedback tokens thing), players are just less worried about losing conflicts overall. <br/><br/>YOWMV, of course :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352953/#Comment_352953" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T09:04:26+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  9:04AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is that augment-hunting ever only was an issue in Heroquest if the players were not on board the game's agenda. A player who does not entirely grog the creative goals might falsely think that his task would be to cause his character to succeed, and his enjoyment would be conditional on his character's success. This would be typical of a player who comes to the game from eg. D&amp;D and does not adjust his assumptions, either because he doesn't want to, or because he doesn't realize that the game's concerns are different. With players who get why we're playing Heroquest instead of, say, D&amp;D, augments do not hold interest primarily because they increase a character's chances, but rather because they feed detail and texture into the character's struggle: this hero wins (or loses) because of these features of his being, whether they be skills, abilities, passions or simply his powerful friends. It's like a spotlight on the fight choreography, except it showcases character features instead of events-over-time like traditional resolution processes tend to do. Scraping up augments with ever more tenuous logic does not serve this highlighting function (rather, it weakens the narrative weight of any single ability if you're going to call upon all of them), and therefore it doesn't happen. I believe that this is why the early versions of the game's rules don't address the issue: it's not evident with players who aren't playing to win, so it never was an issue in playtests, which were presumably played with a cohesive understanding of the nature of the game.<br/><br/>This is not to say that it's not an issue, but as is sometimes the case, I wouldn't blithely assume that it's a mechanical problem when the system is being misused out of misplaced motivation. Augment-hunting in Heroquest is a great example of behaviours that emerge from agenda conflict precisely because it's something that simply is not an issue with players who are truly on-board with the idea that they are depicting their character's struggle, but are not themselves struggling. Check the way you play, and the problem disappears.<br/><br/>Of course it still would be somewhat useful to have a rule that limited augmenting, assuming that rule worked to support the dramatic highlighting function I outline above. As is, the system doesn't really tell you how to best highlight your character, you need to figure it out yourself. If I understood Mark's rules hack correctly, it seems pretty sweet to me: three is a low-enough number of augments to still carry some narrative weight, and when you pay the point to get that limit lifted you're presumably in a situation where you're committed to success, and it's fine and appropriate for you to spend a moment augmenting and relishing the moment anyway.<br/><br/>Thinking back on it, the Heroquest dicing mechanic is pretty funky (a positive way of saying "perverse"). I can see all sorts of ways to handle this whole augment thing now, with the power of hindsight and lots of play with TSoY (a Heroquest descendant if there ever was one). For example, I could see myself making the augmenting a post-roll thing entirely. This way you'd get to roll and see if the augments are needed first, and then you could hunt for augments if it seems that just a couple of bonuses would bring success. Perhaps decide that only abilities that beat the die in the roll get to augment with a bonus equal to mastery^2, just to add a dash of mind-fuckery to already twisted dice mechanics.<br/><br/>Also, a question: where will this be available? Will you sell the physical edition to retailers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353046/#Comment_353046" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T12:33:10+00:00" title="January  3, 2012 12:33PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Also, a question: where will this be available?
