Fred mentioned that some have complained about SotC for extended play because there is no meaty system for character advancement.<br/><br/>So, do you think character advancement is necessary for campaign-style/extended play? If you want some mutiple choice:<br/><br/>a) Totally unnecessary.<br/>b) Nice, but not essential.<br/>c) Very important, but not essential.<br/>d) Absolutely essential.<br/><br/>For my part, I'm in the "b" camp. And I suspect the only reason I'm not a full-on "a" man is some early hard-wiring as a result of D&amp;D. It reinforces the idea of forward momentum for the campaign, but I think the proper shepherding of a campaign arc minimizes its necessity.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102749/#Comment_102749" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T13:43:27+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  1:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm think B too.

In games that do have advancement, I often find that the rewards don't line up with what is being rewarded.  For example, in a D&amp;D game, my rogue gets experience for defeating monsters, which causes him to level up.  When he levels up, he gets more skill points, which I can put into Diplomacy.  Whaaaaa?  I'm rewarded with higher Diplomacy for fighting monsters?  IMO, this problems extends to a lot of games in a lot of ways - I chose D&amp;D because it's easy to pick on. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  On the other hand, games without character advancement often feel static to me, and somehow deny the reality that people change.  I recognize that RPGs and real life frequently diverge in a lot of ways, and even so I find it hard to accept a world where people don't - or can't - change.  Come to think of it though, that's not really synonymous with advancement.  I used to be able to juggle pretty well, but I haven't done it in so long that my skills have atrophied.  Having spent time developing other skills, I'm now good at different things than I used to be.<br/><br/>So I guess my answer is: For me, character advancement is (b) nice, but not necessary.  As an addition though, character change is, in my view, (d) absolutely essential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102752/#Comment_102752" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T13:49:06+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  1:49PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My response to this question is always:<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>No character advancement.

The measure of the character's journey, and just how that measure is shown to have meaning in the game, is dependent on the context of the game in question. It could be traditional as a direct increase in a readily measurable skill such as in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or it could be something more subtle like reaching (or failing to reach) a character's goals feeds back into a general effectiveness pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the case, I know for me personally that long-term, campaign style play is going to fall down and go boom if I don't have some system based feedback mechanism for which to capture the journey of my character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102766/#Comment_102766" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T14:09:49+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  2:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>My response to this question is always:<br><br>Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>No character advancement.

In fact, most of my long campaigns that have stopped have stopped because characters have advanced out of the player's area of interest.  So now even with an advancement system I start characters where they are fun to play and pretty much leave them there.<br/><br/>The three systems I'm thinking of are Classic Traveller (a multi-year game with zero advancement), Spirit of the Century (might not qualify as, although there is character continuity it's very episodic), and our hybrid Spirit of the Far Future which shows signs of having serious legs.  In both SotC-ish games we have a very constrained advancement rule that can never increase the power of the character yet permits growth: after every session a player may add and remove an aspect (maintaining ten) and may increase a skill by one rank while decreasing one from the new rank to the old -- that is, the skill pyramid is retained (say, move a 3 to a 4 and a 4 to a 3).  It's possible for a character to change quite drastically over a handful of sessions, but the change is gradual and the power level does not change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102769/#Comment_102769" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T14:14:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  2:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham right                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102775/#Comment_102775" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T14:24:33+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  2:24PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>My response to this question is always:<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>No character advancement.

But I think what happens is that when people play games that are actually designed to create resolutions to situations they find that they don't need their 90+ session campaign to get satisfaction from their characters.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102780/#Comment_102780" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T14:45:38+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  2:45PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 2:46PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>No character advancement.

I certainly can't think of any TV show that follows a similar structure that doesn't do the same. New characters, resolve old issues, add new ones.

Obviously Christian's chat examples without mechanics just don't have a mechanical aspect, but I assume there is still meaningfull character change.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraveller is an interesting example because it really allows for no change of the character's skills and attributes. But I think one possible change in Traveller is in equipment, the PC's ship, and their economic ability. I've not seen any pure Traveller campaigns so I can't quite be sure, my Traveller campaign allowed a limited amount of skill acquisition, yet it was the equipment that really measured the changes.

If I were your DM o the designer, should  tell you you can't advance Diplomacy? You might have a decent justification for this even if it's unspoken. And if you don't, is there any point in the designer/DM saying "Screw you, you're upranking Tumble because you used it -- doesn't matter what you want."<br/><br/>Now this attracted my attention because I am playing a rogue right now. In practice, I find that I'm usually buying stuff based on what's been going on during the game. Where I have a problem is that D&amp;D emphasises planning your advancement ahead of time, so if I want to get into a PrC ot top off a feat tree I need to advance in a certain way regardless of what's happening in game. New rules for retroactively switching feats seem to respond to this to a degree, but with 4e I'd really like advancement to be less a process of narrowing who my guy can be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102875/#Comment_102875" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T07:18:32+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  7:18AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on the genre, the game and how long it goes.<br/><br/>James Bond doesn't really get better.  Maybe in this new crop of movies, we will see a slight arc... certainly in Casino Royale, he isn't quite a suave and sophisticated ubermensch that we've seen in other films.  The Casino Royale book, Bond is a wet-behind-the years neurotic screw up.  He screws up bad.  Not suave at all.  <br/><br/>But Conan does get better over time.  Conan isn't a good horseman or bowman in the earliest of his chronicles (and this highlighted more in the 70s comic), but he is decent with a sword and great at climbing.  Not to mention he works his way up to king.  For me, Conan, and Elric are more influential on my fantasy gaming than Tolkien... and that path from beginning to high flautin' end is pretty cool to me.<br/><br/>Certainly most Campbellian Hero Journeys ask for some kind of character advancement.  While Frodo and Sam seem to stay pretty constant, Merry and Pippin become warriors and leaders.  <br/><br/>So.  I like character advancement.<br/><br/>Supers is another place, over time, many characters really do become more powerful... or if not more powerful, more well rounded.  Kitty Pride starts out as a 13 year old who can phaze through stuff.  But she picks up some martial arts, can pilot a sophisticated jet and certainly has paramedic skills in a fairly short span of comics.  Her phazing ability gets marginally better (she can do it longer), but that is about it.  However, I look at that, and say, yeah, the character gets better over time.  There is more she can do, and the more she can participate in.<br/><br/>Or look at Weapons of the Gods.  Here is a place were character advancement is *really* part and parcel of the genre tropes. <i> "His kung fu is unbeatable!"  "Yes it would seem so.  But not vs. the Seven Sisters Dragon style... go young man, journey forth to the Mountain of Plume White and learn from reclusive Sacred Tenbaku the Seven Sisters Dragon Style!"</i>  Good lord, how many times have we seen this in wuxia film or comics?<br/><br/>RPGs, for me, are about emulation of these tropes and genres.  Not perfect fits by any stretch.... I've yet to play a character who is dynamic and "cool" as Conan and feels like the series of stories that REH wrote.. although I've played a couple that come close.  <br/><br/>But is it necessary.  No.  Change is probable, and that should be reflected by the game system... allies acquired, enemies made, certainly trauma can result in changes both physical and mental.  If you got an arm hacked off last session, it should affect the character mechanically.  But skills atrophy and new hobbies emerge in all of us.  <br/><br/>Not necessary.  But I'm probably not going to invest quite as much into the PC if there wasn't advancement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102876/#Comment_102876" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T07:23:16+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  7:23AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>Well, you rewarded yourself with Diplomacy -- the encounters just got you XP, which ot you skill points, which you chose to put into Diplomacy.</blockquote>\nIt bothers me that I even have the choice, because it puts the GM in a weird position with the players if they have a more specific notion of character advancement.

The most important thing is that there is some way for the characters to advance towards their goals, but that doesn't have to involve a gain of more powerful skills. If my goal is to become leader of my knightly order then my advancement can involve gaining combat skills, more hit points, and a suite of powerful stunts ... or it can mean that I get promoted, acquire followers, am awarded a sacred relic by my lord ... and so on.<br/><br/>However I think there is a basic gamist principle at work here, which is that once you have mastered a challenge it is a lot less exciting in the future. There are only so many times my knight can kill a goblin and still have it feel exciting. Sure I can kill *more* goblins along with my men. Or I can kill goblins in exciting new ways, but eventually I want to fight something else, and I probably want to fight something bigger and more dangerous as well, which is probably going to involve me being harder as well. Look at any fantasy RPG computer game, and the monsters get harder and harder as the game progresses, because everyone likes the rising challenge and the feeling of succeeding and getting better. There is nothing more frustrating than games where you have to face the same enemies over and over again all the way through. <br/><br/>Character advancement is the way we build that challenge into our games. I can imagine ways to have rising challenge levels without actually increasing character skills (mostly through acquiring stuff, where stuff runs the gammut from swords to armies to greater spiritual understanding), but improving skills and gaining powers is easier and just as satisfying, if not more so, because unlike stuff they can't go away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102919/#Comment_102919" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T14:48:13+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  2:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>I thought about that once.

There is a huge gap between what a skilled player and an unskilled player can do with these things. Then you have individual rules and their individual exploitations. The game has thousands of pages of rules in the current incarnation, and knowing which ones can be used to best effect right now is very powerful: maybe some obscure grappling maneuver will totally save your bacon, or maybe some pointless-looking spell is actually the exact tool you need at this instant. <br/><br/>Seriously, I am playing the way xenopulse mentions right now, deliberately ramping down the character's raw power (by playing weaker classes) and substituting my own skill. It's pure gamist fun.<br/><br/>Even in very small and elegant systems, player skill definitely matters. A good PTA player's constant influx of fanmail leads directly to increased character potential, and greater skill with stake setting does the same thing. Knowing the dice odds really really well actually does make you better at DitV. Simply knowing the ins and outs of your group dynamic lets your character accomplish more, should you wish it. <br/><br/>So, yeah, skill definitely matters. It may not be obvious skill like pulling off tricky traps in Street Fighter, but it's still there. Depending on the system, I can see that improving skill might not be a big enough deal to make it the base of character development in a way that people like, but I think the potential is usually there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102987/#Comment_102987" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T09:04:43+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  9:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not saying player skill is not important in an RPG (though I dislike that, and use GM help as a way to compensate for poor player experience in a way that wouldn't happen, for example, in a wargame), but that it has no link to character experience.<br/><br/>Sure the first time you play a game and take on a character you and the character may grow in skill in step (though you may not), but what about when you retire that character and start with another one? Your new character may start inexperienced, but you don't loose your play skills. So I don't think its right to model growing character ability by relying on some sort of increasing player skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103002/#Comment_103002" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T12:42:44+00:00" title="October 14, 2007 12:42PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would go with B (in the sense of this being a "poll" not a "vote").<br/><br/>Graham has it, if I got him right.  For my taste, change in character should be "possible" though not "required" if the character is to be played over time and advancement (becoming more effective) is one such change.  Growing older, slower, becoming cynical, acquiring responsibilities and baggage that slows down could be others.  Maybe you learn something, maybe you grow stronger, maybe you grow weaker, maybe you learn nothing.  Having none of those on the table may not sit well with many players.  In a "weekly open-ended" campaign, there is the interest of "what new challenge, story, interaction" to interface character with but the interest of "how the changed character interfaces compared to the prior version" is also interesting to "benchmark" against.<br/><br/>To me as a player, learning about the character and seeing how they change in the experiences that come to them is what's interesting playing.  As a GM, seeing how character change (if they do) is what's interesting.  To the degree this is random/uncertain as "player conception meets undetermined events" it is what I enjoy most seeing explored in an RPG play experience.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103085/#Comment_103085" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T09:55:32+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  9:55AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2007 9:56AM by ffilz.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>I guess there could be room for totally episodic play where the outcome of previous sessions was irrelevant, but then can you really say it's a campaign?

If a later session makes no reference to earlier sessions, what is it? My thought is that without such reference, you just can't have a campaign. But as to whether mechanical character improvement is necessary, that's a valid question.<br/><br/>Playing a declinging character: I have a hard time finding fun in this, for something like this to work, there would have to be something else that is making continuing play richer. Building up the setting and such might be the trick. But the mechanics would also have to support it.

I think that if you have long-term play as a goal of a system that you do need to have something in the game that mechanically changes over time, that the player taps into. It doesn't have to be character power, or even the characters at all, in fact (Shreyas is right that sometimes the most interesting character is the one that refuses to change... The Prisoner, anyone?) <br/>\n<br/>\nSituation will, of course, change, and that'll change the mechanics... but this isn't really enough if it's a GM controlled thing. The player really does have to have something to play with mechanically along the way in order to make the system engaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat could be advancement. Or development. Or evolution. But it could even be the player making up the situation, or any other element of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, with purely, purely episodic play, perhaps this isn't even important. Play becomes less about the character than about the new situation (PTA could work for 10 seasons, Hawkeye never changed his issue of "Covering His Grief with Humor" for eleven years of MASH). But most RPG play is a tad more serial than that, and you aren't going to get any sense of continuity without something mechanical to adjust to represent the ongoing flow of the situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Soap Operas are especially this way, I'd argue. I intentionally try to make my long-term play of HQ as Soap-Opera-esque as possible, and HQ is good for that, because the characters do change mechanically over time to represent this. They don't really become more powerful, note (sans raising keyword levels, which is not a normal part of the "advancement" mechanism). Really it's much more like development. For instance, it's much more notable when a player takes a new relationship at 13 than when they raise an ability from 18 to 19 for the same price. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that there's lots of opportunity to be had in mechanics that adjust over time. Are they required? Not at all. Do they make sense for most long-term designs? Almost certainly. But the form they can take is pretty wide open. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103318/#Comment_103318" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T14:50:34+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  2:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my first posts on The Forge was questioning why improvement mechanics were ubiquitous.

So it's correlation without direct causation. <br/><br/>Another possibility is that a long-running game needs everyone to have at least a certain minimum threshold of interest. A "story" or "character" driven game will implode the moment the story or character-arcs become sufficiently well explored that one "might as well" start over with something fresh. A character-advancement driven game, on the other hand, can maintain that minimum level of interest indefinitely - or at least until you run out of chances to advance. Furthermore, if there is advancement, AND a norm that new games always restart at "level 1" then there's a very specific reason not to start over - you'll lose all the advancement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104047/#Comment_104047" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T13:35:13+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  1:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll go with "c", but clarified as Graham clarified it earlier in the thread: I want to see my character's develop, if not necessarily advance.

Its not just about seeing your character develop in some mechanical way, its also about offering new play experiences for the players. In most games the sorts of things you (the player) can do are restricted by the abilities (traits, skills, connections, whatever) of your character. New abilities mean new types of play, new types of story and so forth, which keep the interest of the players going in the long term.<br/><br/>That is the biggest factor for me. I've played in a number of multi-year campaigns (in fact I would call that the norm), and the thought of having to sit down to session 300 and be faced with the same play as in session 1 doesn't attract. On the other hand if in session 150 I suddenly gain a skill in stealth, or a relation to the king, or a new spell, then there is a different thing to be explored and I am excited again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104570/#Comment_104570" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T08:35:59+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  8:35AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2007 8:37AM by Arminius.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cydmab, advancement can also kill interest when your characters advance out of the "sweet spot" of interest. Has it happened to me? No, but I've heard it mentioned among e.g. GURPS and D&amp;D players.<br/><br/>I'd like to play a long-running game with minimal advancement as an option. (In fact I think the three-longest running games I've played have featured very little advancement.) As others have said, "development" of some sort is important to me, not necessarily the character per se in terms of beliefs or values; it could be the campaign as a whole in relation to the character. Or the character's position in the world (e.g., gaining or losing wealth or responsibility).<br/><br/>The thing that makes it a bit scary to get off the advancement train is the fact that traditional advancement is a simple way to protect a character mechanically at about the same pace that the character gains interest. It also compensates for play balance mechanisms. By which I mean, it can be boring if every character is automatically "the best swordsman in the land"...and impossible if you have more than one PC in the game. The promise of future advancement is a kind of compensation for accepting limits in the here and now.<br/><br/>If you can achieve those goals (character protection and acceptance of limitations) without using advancement, I probably don't need it. I know ways to do both but I'm not sure I've seen completely satisfactory ones. (Not even advancement is surefire, but it's tried &amp; true.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104936/#Comment_104936" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T23:50:19+00:00" title="October 25, 2007 11:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D. Jacobson</cite>Something bubbled up from<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4538&amp;page=1#Comment_102746" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>that had me thinking. Fred mentioned that some have complained about SotC for extended play because there is no meaty system for character advancement.<br/><br/>So, do you think character advancement is necessary for campaign-style/extended play? If you want some mutiple choice:<br/><br/>a) Totally unnecessary.<br/>b) Nice, but not essential.<br/>c) Very important, but not essential.<br/>d) Absolutely essential.<br/><br/>For my part, I'm in the "b" camp. And I suspect the only reason I'm not a full-on "a" man is some early hard-wiring as a result of D&amp;D. It reinforces the idea of forward momentum for the campaign, but I think the proper shepherding of a campaign arc minimizes its necessity.</blockquote>\nSorry to jump in a bit late, but i was thinking about this with regard to Four Colors al Fresco, and had to think about it for a bit. I think it depends on what you mean by "campaign-style" play. If you mean simply ongoing, indefinite-end style of play, no, i don't think you need to have advancement. I've played Four Colors al Fresco for months of weekly play without any advancement, and no problems. (al Fresco *does* have advancement, but it's one of the parts that might get re-written.) But then, much like SotC, it's designed around episodic play, and a world where things don't really change much--like the old action pulps, or the worst of Star Trek, there are no real lasting ramifications. I think the only problem is when you have a changing world, with unchanging characters. And like others have said, that change doesn't have to be <i>advancement</i>, per se, it just needs to be change in response to the characters' experiences.<br/><br/>So, i think that's disagreeing with you: when there's a campaign arc, you need character change--the campaign arc necessitates it, rather than substituting for it. When there isn't a campaign arc--no forward momentum, as you say--then it's ok if the characters are relatively stagnant, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104983/#Comment_104983" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T09:12:31+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  9:12AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">But then, much like SotC, it's designed around episodic play, and a world where things don't really change much--like the old action pulps, or the worst of Star Trek, there are no real lasting ramifications.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI have a really hard time defining this type of play as a campaign. Perhaps it's my wargame roots. Playing Afrika Korps, then Anzio, and finally D-Day (all Avalon Hill games, played in historical order) is not a campaign game. It's three independant games. Playing all the scenarios of Up Front in order isn't a campaign game (and there, for sure the same characters are used). But Up Front does have a set of campaign rules. They allow the characters to change and the results of earlier games in the series to affect later games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess the question is what definition of campaign play are we using? If a series of games using the same setting, mechanics, and (mostly) the same characters but where previous games have no impact on later games, then sure, nothing has to change. But that's a totally different set up from a series of games where it is expected that earlier sessions have a direct impact on later sessions. In the later style, obviously something changes, yet it need not mean mechanical improvement of characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4541/is-character-advancement-necessary-for-campaign-style-play" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4541/is-character-advancement-necessary-for-campaign-style-play" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4541/is-character-advancement-necessary-for-campaign-style-play/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4541%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4541%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
