It's telling that several individuals I know who have decades of experience in some RPGs are dumbfounded at others.  <br/><br/>And yet, I find that "noobs" instinctually know "how to play" when I've introduced them to the hobb<b>ies</b>.  It's the people who come in with fewer assumptions that tend to be easiest to teach.  What they're most confused about (or more likely, fearful of) is being the person in the group who doesn't know all the rules as well.  Even then, most of the time, they learn more quickly than they think.<br/><br/>These sections in books aren't trying to teach the fine points of any system; they're trying to define their version of a concept whose core ideas are already generally understood.  "How to roleplay in <i>this</i> game" is definitely more appropriate for these sections.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139134/#Comment_139134" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T16:43:59+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  4:43PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 4:45PM by jhkim.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just chiming in with the others here.

No stories. No explanation of GM/Player roles and responsibilities.

Most people learn to play RPGs from people who know how to play RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, to that extent, I think that there's not much benefit to having "How to play RPGs" sections in games. For those who do see value in them, I'd ask them what is it?  John, you know how to play RPGs, right? What's a section like that going to do for you? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that the only purpose these sections serve is to make the game theoretically more approachable to people outside of the hobby who want to give it a try. Again, while there's annecdotal evidence that this happens, what are the odds that the game they try first is going to be yours, and not D&amp;D? I mean for an indie, the sales figures are tiny. What number of people are going to be those who come to your game out of the blue? What, they're going to walk into their FLGS, and pick your game up off the shelf from amongst all of those there? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, even if this miracle does happen, then what? They're going to open the book, see there's no section called, "How to Play RPGs" and not buy the book? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, worst case, they just can't figure out how to play, and the "loss" you get here is any viral sales that might have occured from actual play of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that all assumes that the games are actually opaque. What's odd about every single "How to Play RPGs" section is that they don't tell you how to play RPGs. They give you analogies, and often bad ones at that. "It's cops and robbers, but with rules for when you shoot somebody." Read one of those sections... go ahead. Tell me now, just how does that section actually instruct anyone on how to play an RPG? Where are the procedures? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat all such sections are boil down to self-conscious attempts to validate the hobby. Does Monopoly have a section labeled "What are boardgames?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd argue that, in fact, pretty much every RPG contains what you need to play it outside of that section. That is, let's say you are a newb, and you do pick up such a game... are you really not going to get what to do with it? I'll bet that for the people in the annecdotes above, that the "How to Play an RPG" section - if the game in question had one at all - had very little to do with them getting how to play, and what to do. Most of them figure out what to do just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, cue the few people who got an RPG sans training, and, in fact, did not get what it was about. Mostly I hear about this happening to people when they were kids. And, heck, these games read like textbooks, so I'm not surprised that some don't understand the procudures of play. And, again, how many of those games did, in fact, have the perfunctory "How do You Play an RPG?" section? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that where failure occurs, that's a problem with describing the actual procedures of play. I think that what this begs is simply clearer rules. I mean... aren't the rules the answer to "how to play?"<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, sure, if you want to include a section on actual technique, or something, I'm all for it (especially if it's supported by the mechanics). If what we're asking for here is what Mikael is talking about, "How to play THIS RPG" then I can hardly be against that. That's what the rules are, in my opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd all of this assumes that I want more people playing RPGs, and think that it's feasible by making the texts clearer. But, frankly I don't think we need more people playing RPGs. Rather most people who want to be playing RPGs are. For those that aren't, I can get them to play by showing them how. Call it solopsistic, but if they're playing, and I'm not involved, what do I care? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I already have a foolproof method for getting new folks in, should I want to do so. Though I don't have much need to do so. And really could get people to understand how to play from most texts anyhow, even if they don't have such a section. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... why would I tell a designer he needs to have one? <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, your text should show how to play your RPG. No, it doesn't have to have any meta-text that enlightens anyone as to what the fun is all about. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139247/#Comment_139247" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T08:23:29+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  8:23AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>It seems to me that the only purpose these sections serve is to make the game theoretically more approachable to people outside of the hobby who want to give it a try.

This last bit is what I'd like to see more of. I believe such examples could capture nuances of what the author intends to occur at the table which straight "rules" or abstract "examples" can't. <i>With Great Power</i> does a great job of this, especially by including "problem players" into the play example - it serves a comedic value, but more importantly primes the reader for what kind of problems can occur at the table and how to deal with them in the context of this game.<br/><br/>"In the context of this game" is important - play examples should not show "what role-playing is" but "what role-playing in this game should probably be like". Elaborate characterization may be right for one game and not for another. Actor stance may be right for one game and not for another. Overtly justifying a character's actions may be right for one game and not for another. Regardless, I think it would be very informative and useful to read how the author of the game anticipates it being actually played by actual people for maximum effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139572/#Comment_139572" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T07:05:35+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  7:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2008 7:07AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Examples are great, too. Look at the topic of the thread. The question is whether or not we need a "What is roleplaying?" section in a book. Or a "How to Play this Game" section. I'd argue that "How to Play this Game" is, in fact, the rules of the game. I don't see a need for any description other than the procedures of play (examples being a method to elucidate such rules). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat gets added, in the "What is Roleplaying" sections or "How to roleplay" is meta-text that tries to justify why RPGs are fun, or get people to wrap their heads around what's going to happen in play. And we all seem to agree that such text isn't all that important? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real question is whether John is right, and RPGs as published don't provide clear enough guidelines to play. Which is odd, since there is all of that annecdotal evidence saying that one can figure it out. It almost sounds to me, John, like you're saying that the texts as they exist are something that you yourself could comprehend, but not something that you would expect other folks to get. You're smarter than they are, is that it? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure you'll respond that, in fact, if you had started with only a copy of My Life with Master, as opposed to Basic D&amp;D, that you'd have had no idea what to do. Yes? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I'm not giving out RPGs as Christmas gifts (I think that would be like giving golf clubs to non-golfers), I don't get Christmas gifts for the people I would play with, just family. Again, if I need more gamers, I can make them. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean that I'm not helping to maximize the market for indie RPGs? Let me let you in on something... I don't buy indie RPGs. Not unless I'm going to play them for certain. At home, with my home gaming groups. Meaning that even if I expect to play a game like In a Wicked Age at conventions like I did this last weekend, I'm going to count on somebody else having the book, and not purchase it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think that Vincent would think me evil for feeling this way, either. <br/>\n<br/>\nIndie games aren't about being some mutual-support group that creates internal sales for each other that keeps us all afloat. Indeed it's really not about making money at all. That's a nice side-effect that makes it possible to create these games. So you'll pardon me if your (in my opinion misplaced) discomfort with the potential for Indie games to be given as Christmas gifts registers a big zero on my "Care-About-It-ometer."<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, that's not me at all saying that we can't improve on our delivery, there's always room for improvement, and we indies probably do have a long way to go... most of us are pretty new to this, you know. If all you're doing is exhorting us to have clearer texts, all I can say is, "We're trying as hard as we can!" And I think we're doing well enough for any reasonable purpose. Though, again, we can always do better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny notion that we're making these games intentionally opaque is ridiculous.

Afterwards I sometimes played with other players (that seemed to have done the same on their side).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139589/#Comment_139589" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T09:08:51+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  9:08AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making up sections for beginners is irrelevant if you are directing your sales to beginners.<br/><br/>It might also be appropriate to consider whether a game-producer even has the wherewithal to create a game for beginners. As mentioned numerous times in numerous places, if you're going to make a game for beginners, you really kinda need to make it complete as well as familiar enough for a beginner to grasp.<br/><br/>If you can't do that, it may not be worth the trouble to throw in Intro stuff at all. In fact, it might be worth skipping entirely.<br/><br/>Beyond any "How to..." section be present, there's also the presentation of that info. To me that includes length and format. Are your instructions set up in a way that someone opening your game can go to them and figure out where to begin? Do you use a short amount of text, diagrams, whatever? How does your How-to section stack up, not against other RPGs, but against other games?<br/><br/>Are you using Gamer-Jargon? Are you, personally, clear on just how much different RPGer expectations are versus the expectations of someone used to off-the-shelf, non-specialty store board and card games? Like " RPG X is awesome because you get to come back every week, again and again, and it never ends unless you want it to and nobody has to lose and there's no winner!!!!!" ( paraphrase courtesy of an over-sugared 11 year old komradebob, as remembered through the mist of the years).<br/><br/>To a very real extent, your game's form is limited by the resources you have available, includng time, money, material, and markets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139661/#Comment_139661" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T17:24:10+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  5:24PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2008 5:24PM by elmago79.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jacob</cite>I would be very curious to see what would happen if you took four people who had never played a role playing game in their lives, gave them a rule book and a handful of dice, and asked them to \u201cfigure it out.\u201d</blockquote>\nI've seen this happen more times than I can count. I've even seen three different groups that invented RPGs on their own. I think that having someone that teaches you how to play is actually the odd case. You don't hear a lot of talk about this "silent majority" because they're not connected to any online or offline communities. They learned to play together and are not interested in playing with anyone else, sort of the way Mike Holmes talks about, but in reverse.
