I'm working on something of an LB hack and I could use some input from you fine folks, if you wouldn't mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, my friends run a minicon every summer, and last year I ran LB and it was a big hit. I want to run LB again this year, and talking about it with my fiancee she gave me the bug to try running a prequel/alternate history scenario. The thing is that I'm not used to running/developing such character and story-centric games as LB (though I've adored running Mr. Harper's original scenario), and I'd love it if anyone here could give me some input about bases I need to cover and directions to go with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've got so far:<br/>\n-The PCs are Natasha Syri, Naomi Campbell, Uriah Flint, Malacai Soto (a captain in Flint's pirate navy), and Isobel Ravaan of House Snow (scion of a dispossessed house and friend/rival of Lady Blackbird).<br/>\n-The starting situation is that Crimson Sky rebels have crashed the party where Lady B's betrothal is being announced, and are holding everyone hostage. Uriah Flint got wind of the betrothal and crashed the party in cognito with Cpt. Soto (a la Romeo and Mercutio) to confront his (once) beloved. Lady Snow, who is actually quite taken with the Count, would do anything to get her frenemy Lady Blackbird out of the picture without harming her, including helping her escape with the Pirate King. Lady Blackbird has just recognized Flint. The navy is on its way to deal with the rebels, and Flint too if he sticks around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsobel Ravaan feels a little tossed-in and tangential to me, but I feel like she's a much more interesting 5th character option than just giving Flint two wingmen. Also, I don't know how she'd stay involved with the story once Uriah Flint (possibly with Lady B) makes his escape unless she's in turn taken hostage by the pirates as insurance once the story gets to that point, and that a LOT of planning for a Hackbird game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Also, thank you all in advance! Especially you, Mr. Harper, for sharing such a great game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322469/#Comment_322469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T23:08:50+00:00" title="April 30, 2011 11:08PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just noticed this post. Surprised no one else has responded, but anyway.<br/><br/>How about as an alternative scenario, and one that might get some more group coherency: a tale of how Uriah Flint became the sky pirate he is, and perhaps have his initial meeting Natasha as part of the story? I don't think anyone has really covered the whos and whys of Uriah Flint before the beginning of his infamous reputation, so it's probably fair game to build some backstory?<br/><br/>Perhaps something like he's a minor noble with seemingly poor magical prospects, and at a party where he is acting as an attendant for an Admiral, he meets the Lady Blackbird, when the party is crashed by sky pirates intent on taking treasures and hostages...and when one of the pirates turns out to be an old sorcery classmate of Uriah's, he gets unintentionally fingered as one of the pirates. What follows is Uriah, Natasha, Naomi (on order of Natasha), Malacai (the pirate), and Isobel (who maybe is an ally of Malacai...getting him into the party and pretending to be a hostage?) getting chased by Imperial forces intent on liberating the noble ladies.<br/>You could start the scenario with them hiding in a storeroom, momentarily escaping the notice of some guards, but footsteps are approaching rapidly...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339752/#Comment_339752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T11:35:23+00:00" title="August 20, 2011 11:35AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see a chapter 3 that features Uriah Flint as the central character.  It would be awesome to have two tables, one playing Lady Blackbird and the other table playing Uriah and gang.  Then, when it fits the story, you combine the tables for a grand finale of Uriah and Lady Blackbird's reunion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
