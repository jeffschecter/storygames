                    This is an idea for an alternate experience system for use with a series of Iron Heroes i'm planning, heavily inspired by <a href="http://workshop.chimera.info/index.php?title=Wyrd" rel="nofollow">Matt Snyder's Wyrd d20</a>, which arose upon my discovery that Iron Heroes a) includes no discussion on awarding XP, and b) stresses heroic action over killing &amp; looting. (Yes, i know it's a player's handbook.)<br/><br/>So i figured: Why not award XP for accomplishing appropriately heroic deeds?<br/><br/>How does this work? I imagine that, unlike the Wyrd system, you choose a heroic deed appropriate to your current  level which, upon accomplishment, grants you all the XP needed to level up to the next.  This means that heroic deeds are huge, glorious things that shake the world and reshape it â€“ nothing trivially accomplished or entirely personal is kosher. So you would say something like: â€œFor my 5th level, I, Konrad the Bloody-Handed, will drive the foul barbarian raiders from their fastness in the Silver-Pine Mountains!â€<br/>I imagine party members may share the same overarching heroic deed, and it would probably be best if they do.<br/><br/>However, that is not the end of the story. Once you've settled on the general outline of the great deed that your hero is compelled to attempt, you then break it down into a number of smaller goals that will serve as challenging steps on the path to achieving that full measure of heroism. You don't have to choose them all at once â€“ it might be best if you take each step one at a time. Doing it piece-mail allows you to try one way, fail, and then find another way to move closer to your goal. Perhaps this is a suitable first milestone: â€œTrack the raiders back to their camp in the mountains.â€ (Although setting many miliestones like this one might lead to an undesirably low number of combat scenes.) <br/><br/>What I'm particularly not sure about is whether you should gain XP for each step, or delay the award until the full journey is complete. Likely, you could award experience subjectively, dependent on how much further that milestone moves you toward your goal â€“ when you reach that last one you've gained all the experience needed for your level. This way, the smaller your milestones, the longer it takes you to level up.<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to allow each party member to chose separate milestones, or even separate deeds entirely, but i cannot see how that could work with the underlying d20 party structure.<br/><br/>I have no idea how well this whole idea would work in practice, but it seems like fun!<br/><br/>Any obvious fatal flaws in using something like this to set out the game's challenges?<br/><br/>Also, how does it compare with WyrD20 â€“ why not just use that?<br/><br/>Is it too structured? Or supporting the wrong CA?<br/><br/>Did someone more competant put together something like this or Wyrd that i could use?                </div>

Aside from that I think you're onto something.<br/>

Asking the PC's, "Okay, in order to gain your next level, what do you want to achieve?" is a good thing.                        </div>

                            I've been thinking along similar lines for my RPG, but I'm going to also allow for characters who are motivated by things like Vengeance (eg. Kill Orcs) and Greed (eg. Grab the Loot) in addition to more heroic goals.                        </div>

IIRC, there's not much of that in Iron Heroes. Part of it's whole gig is that characters aren't dependent on their magic items.                        </div>

                            Stefan - that's pretty cool, especially for Iron Heroes.<br><br>Stuart, I basically straight-drifted in Keys from TSOY and made advancement totally modular in my D&amp;D campaign. As Fred points out, XP for spells and items might become an issue, we havent really had to deal with it yet. I know it allows some more power in a few ways, but we play rarely enough that fast advancement isn't really a concern. I'm also aware that my skill point distribution and some other things are overgenerous. Players tend to earn maybe 15XP per session, which is most of the way to a new level if you include all the little bits and pieces. From the House Rules page on our (nonpublic) wiki:<br><br><b>Spending XP</b><br/><br/>Whenever you want, you can spend your XPs for immediate advances that happen at the table. The only caveat is that you can't spend in the same category twice in a row - you can't advance Str and then use your next advance on Int, because they're both Ability Scores. For purposes of hit points and skill points, your character's most recent level is referred to as its "current" class. We'll work out how other 'spend-XP' stuff like item creation works later.<br/><br/><b>Ability Scores</b><br/><br/>Here are the costs to raise an ability score, based on where the score is before the advance:<br/><br/>    * Below 10 - 1XP<br/>    * 11-15 - 3XP<br/>    * 16-20 - 5XP<br/>    * 21-25 - 7XP<br/>    * 26-35 - 9XP<br/>    * Above 35 - 11XP <br/><br/><b>Skill Points</b><br/><br/>    * 1 level's worth by current class or 10 skill points, whichever is greater - 5XP<br/>    * 5 skill points - 3XP<br/>    * Make a cross-class skill into a class skill permanently - 5XP <br/><br/><b>Feats</b><br/><br/>Normal prerequisites still apply.<br/>    * Skill Feats (those that only add a couple of skill points to 2 skills) - 1XP<br/>    * Normal Core Feats - 4XP<br/>    * Non-Core Feats - 6XP<br/>    * Epic Feats (reqs. lev 15 or higher) - 8XP <br/><br/><br/><b>Classes</b><br/><br/>This includes class abilities, normal spell progression, BAB, and Saving Throws. In other words, only those things that show up on a class' level chart in the PHB. (NOTE: When leveling up a class make sure to underline this class for future HP and skill point calculations; This is your "current" class)<br/><br/>    * Leveling up a base class (or prestige class you qualify for) - 7XP<br/>    * Leveling up a Gestalt Class - 10XP<br/>    * Adding a template that makes sense in the story - 5XP per ECL <br/><br/><br/><b>Hit Points</b><br/><br/>The minimum die size is d3; the maximum die size is 2d8. The progression goes 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12, 2d8<br/><br/>    * 1 Hit Die of your current class size - 5XP<br/>    * 1 Hit Die of your current class size-1 - 4XP<br/>    * 1 Hit Die of your current class size+1 - 6XP<br/>    * 1 Hit Die of your current class size+2 - 7XP<br/>    * 1 Hit Die of your current class size+3 - 8XP <br/><br/><br/><b>Spellcasting</b><br/><br/>    * Add an available cleric domain associated with your diety - 7XP<br/>    * Add a "spells per day" casting slot - 3XP per level of slot<br/>    * Add a spontaneous caster "known spells" slot - 4XP per level of slot <br/><br/><br/><b>Keys</b><br/><br/>Everyone starts with 2 Keys of either type (Character Keys or Player Keys).<br/><br/>    * Add an additional key (up to 6) - 5XP <br/><br/><b>Action Dice</b><br/><br/>I give out a finite number (3-5) "stunt dice" at the beginning of a session, that can only be used to do cool stunts, for which they behave exactly like action dice. If and when dire situations arise in-game, players can spend XP at the current rate of 1XP=1 die for 'save my butt action dice', which behave the same way, but can't be bought just to do showy maneuvers. <br/><br/>Sorry for the total threadjack. I like yours, too.<br/><br/><b>edit</b>: before anyone starts, I'm not putting this here for critique and 'Hey! that's not balanced!'. We already use it, we already like it. Just putting it up here as another example of how advancement in d&amp;d can be simplified/adjusted/modularized/made into less of a headache.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, i figure magic item making XP isn't much of a concern for Iron Heroes, since they're mentioned like twice in the book - and one of those is telling you not to rely on them. I suppose the rules for IH magic items are in a supplement somewhere.<br/><br/>Dave - That's pretty cool. In some ways it reminds me of Storyteller advancement, only, you know, based on actual play rather than attendance... Wonder if anyone has ported Keys into Exalted yet?                        </div>

                            My TSOY hack Errantry, which is about quests, works this by having "boons" which are, basically, plot tokens. They're a set number of tokens determined by the group as being needed to complete the quest (a pacing system, more or less). Mechanically, in each conflict there is a certain value of boons at stake and if the characters are successful in the conflict, they win them. Narratively, they are things which would help on their quest - magic items, information, NPC helper/guides. When all the boons are collected, the party is ready to complete the quest, and does so using all the magic items, info and NPC helper/guides that they haven't already used up.<br/><br/>That's probably a lot more narrativist than what you're looking for, but the basic "plot tokens" idea may be of use to you.                        </div>

                            I think this is a neat idea, but (with the caveat that I've only skimmed Iron Heroes) I am a little skeptical of any D&amp;D XP hack that does not reward any sort of tactical achievement (i.e. winning fights) on the part of the PCs. To me, the kind of heroic deeds one performs in D&amp;D are things like 'killing five men with a single swing of your axe' or 'hitting a bird in flight with an arrow at 500 yards' or 'bringing down the castle walls with a timely word of power.' You know, the stuff that the rest of the system is designed around!<br/><br/>I guess my response here is similar to my response when Matt posted the Wyrd rules on the Forge -- more granularity and more tactical rewards seem like a good idea, whether in addition to or instead of the larger story-level goals. Those larger goals are very useful in the way they help players &amp; GMs collaborate on building the adventure, for sure, but I'm not sure if they can carry the action completely.<br/><br/>My current 'thing that makes me actually want to play D&amp;D' is the idea of tactical-level 'bonus rewards' that players can choose and then attempt to achieve. Things like 'every time I win an encounter without taking any damage at all, gain 50xp' or 'every time I do more than 30 damage in a single hit, gain 75xp'. This would be on top of a regular experience system, allowing for some strong Gamist differentiation between players -- it also directly rewards players for building characters that can achieve specific tactical effects. The guy with Power Attack and a two-handed great-axe is gonna take some sort of bonus that gets him XP when he does huge damage to a single target, while someone more interested in chopping through dozens of kobolds might take something like 'for every opponent past the first that I defeat in a single round of combat, gain 100xp'.<br/><br/>As far as how this might be applied to the current idea, my thought is to suggest that players select Heroic Deeds which are a little less story-oriented and a little more tactical, while still keeping that heroic flavour. Something like 'for 5th level, I will defeat an entire army of soldiers while fighting blindfolded' for example -- a great tactically-heroic achievement for a kung fu monk who took the Blind Fighting feat. A Barbarian might take 'I will achieve a great victory without relying on my rage' (forcing him to avoid using rage in the most important fight, a tactical disadvantage), or might go the other way and say 'in a furious rage I will destroy the corrupt Warlord Han Tsu in single combat' (in which case he has to make sure to save his rage ability, and arrange for single combat -- also tactical challenges.)<br/><br/>This could easily be formalised -- i.e. every level requires both a major heroic tactical achievement and a major heroic story achievement. The above examples all combine them, but they could easily be divided to give the player more flexibility. ("I will win at least one fight with one arm tied behind my back" + "I will drive the bandits out of the hills and into the sea.") The story elements help make sure the GM andplayer can collaborate on the kind of overall goals they're interested in, while the tactical elements I think do a better job of preserving the basic Step-on-Up/Gamist structure that D&amp;D already supports.                        </div>

Ah, yes, that could be a problem - i've been assuming that a) all quests are achievable and b) nothing could happen in the game-fiction to make you want to change your overall quest, (even as you're changing your milestone sub-quests).<br/><br/>Changing goals is troublesome, especially when multiple players share a quest. (Not to mention potential GM prep-work lost.) <br/><br/>I suppose that means that this idea is almost the opposite of TSOY-style Keys, like the Wyrd system, as their strongest feature seems to be changing easily &amp; often. But this idea sort of operates on a different level. <br/><br/>Perhaps if you, as a group, were allowed to re-write part of the overall quest goal each time you completed a milestone? And XP was better tied to the milestones, rather than the complete quest...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I think this is a neat idea, but (with the caveat that I've only skimmed Iron Heroes) I am a little skeptical of any D&amp;D XP hack that does not reward any sort of tactical achievement (i.e. winning fights) on the part of the PCs. To me, the kind of heroic deeds one performs in D&amp;D are things like 'killing five men with a single swing of your axe' or 'hitting a bird in flight with an arrow at 500 yards' or 'bringing down the castle walls with a timely word of power.' You know, the stuff that the rest of the system is designed around!</blockquote>
This is a very good point - you have to make sure you reward the players for doing those things that the game cares about. Right now i'm just rewarding them for helping provide large-scale game structure, and not for making interesting choices along the path. Troublesome.<br/><br/>Normally, you're rewarded for killing monsters &amp; solving puzzles - the better you manage/conserve your strategic resources, the more monsters &amp; puzzles you can rack up XP for. So here interesting choices are only awarded when they help you survive to kill more monsters.<br/><br/>But by awarding those interesting choices themselves you're on to something! (Especially for a game which claims to be more tactical than standard D&amp;D.) I'm just not sure what, exactly.<br/><br/>So let's say you do this:<br/><br/>- You (as a group) claim a large-scale "heroic deed" appropriate to your effective level - this allows you to channel your source of adversity &amp; decide on the outline for your adventure (for this level). It's a structuring mechanic, assisting with GM-prep &amp; establishing player buy-in. (I hope.)<br/><br/>- Next, you (also as a group) hash out what first step you're going to take on the path to your overarching goal. "To defeat the Dragon King, first we must bring down the tyrant overseer." <br/>I've been thinking that there is a major XP award for completing the milestone, sized dependant upon the size of the step taken. So "Assassinate the Dragon King" earns you a much bigger award (but is much harder?) than "Remove the overseer from power". However, that seems to incentivize the wrong behaviour, in regard to the steps on a path feel intended for the milestones. But you always know that once you complete the deed, you level up...<br/>(Yes, this seems to be extremely messy and possibly recursive... Should there be a limit on the maximum XP awarded per milestone? Should one predetermine how many steps it takes to accomplish the deed, or let that arise organically?)<br/><br/>- Third, we break the milestone down into organic challenges in play - a series of skill tests and combats that sum up to achieving the milestone. Hopefully there's some roleplaying in there, too. (I imagine the GM having a stable of opponents &amp; hazards germain to the milestone that can be brought into play as needed.)<br/><br/>- Lastly, during the "organic challenges" phase, each player can work in "called challenges" for their character - opportunities to be challenged tactically, show your guy being awesome, and earn small packets of bonus XP. I imagine you'd need some sort of guidelines to tell you how much XP is appropriate... Things like: "I'm going to climb across the rafters and drop poison in the warlord's cup without being seen, for 200 XP!"<br/><br/>How does that seem? I'm really not sure what to do about the milestone XP award in conjunction with the "called challenge" XP bonuses...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sempiternity</cite>Normally, you're rewarded for killing monsters &amp; solving puzzles - the better you manage/conserve your strategic resources, the more monsters &amp; puzzles you can rack up XP for.</blockquote>
One thing that might be interesting to consider here is that one of the strategic resources you have might be 'time remaining in this game session.' I mean, it's great if you finish every combat in perfect health, achieving complete victory, but if you do so by taking 6 hours of real-game time to do so, and you were fighting five zombies, then in some important sense your characters are going to level up slower than the group that slammed through the zombies, fought the ghasts, took heavy losses from the werewolves and confronted the lich king's henchmen in the same 6 hours -- even if they nearly died doing so, because they spent less time thinking about their tactical choices.<br/><br/>(This may be a bit of a tangent -- it's something I notice a lot when playing CRPGs, and I've recently been slogging my way through Neverwinter Nights 2, a game in which resting is instantaneous and has no impact whatsoever on story-level effectiveness. Could I have killed that troll without taking damage, instead of sloppily forgetting to power attack despite his low AC? Um, sure... but since the cost of taking that damage in effectiveness is miniscule compared to the amount of time I would have had to spend managing yet another meaningless fight, it doesn't make any sense to do so.)<br/><br/>So yeah, it's a total tangent, but what I mean is that not all groups will look at effectiveness the same way -- some groups would rather level up every session than maximize their performance in every fight, and there is a meta-concern governing that choice.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>So, back to the actual topic: I suspect that it will be more fun for the players if they set their goals, but are not involved in breaking those goals down into specific pieces. This is part of why general goals might be more fun -- they leave the GM more room to surprise the players with unusual opportunities to get what they want (and vice versa.) Also, if you're going to stick with a 'one major goal per level' scenario, it's really not important to worry about how much XP any individual piece is giving, since XP is essentially useless until you have enough of it to make a level. What this approach also does is allows players to (as you say) choose more risky routes to their goals in order to minimize the amount of time required to complete the goal -- another opportunity for Gamist voodoo. Killing the Dragon King straight off the bat should definitely be harder than beating down all his minions first and THEN killing him -- because the reward for doing so is gaining that level much faster.<br/><br/>Of course, this is diluted if you include bonus XP, since in that case each encounter may be an opportunity to rack up XP -- this might tempt players to arrange for many less-risky encounters in which they can showboat for XP, which may or may not be desireable. If this is a problem it could possibly be mitigated by attaching some sort of multiplier based on the importance of the scene to the goal.<br/><br/>For example, let's say every level requires 13 Goal Points. The players set their goal and you respond by presenting a menu of sorts, wherein you detail some possible means to achieve this, and give each means an appropriate GP rating. For example, if the goal is to drive the bandits out of the mountains, you might have:<br/><br/>Stumble across a bandit raiding party in the forest (GP 1)<br/>Find a wounded or dying bandit (GP 1)<br/>Provide the bandits with other possibilities for making a living (GP 2)<br/>Learn important information about the bandits (GP 2)<br/>Rescue a village from a bandit attack (GP 2)<br/>Make contact with a possible traitor within the bandits (GP 2)<br/>Teach the villagers to defend themselves against the bandits (GP 4)<br/>Take control of the bandits and make them your personal henchmen (GP 8)<br/>Kill the bandit king (GP 6)<br/>Kidnap the bandit king's daughter (GP 4)<br/>Destroy the bandit camp (GP 6)<br/><br/>And of course players can suggest new ones. As you might suspect from my choice of the number 13, just map the GP rating to the appropriate CR in order to get the usual 13 encounters = 1 level payout. GP 1 encounters = even-CR encounters, and it goes up from there.<br/><br/>Now, players can either choose one of these mini-goals at a time (aiming for a more organic feel), or maybe they don't choose as players at all and you just use the list to figure out when they've solved the bandit problem. Or maybe the players choose to combine them into single encounters -- it's not hard to imagine how rescuing a wounded bandit might be combined with making contact with a possible bandit traitor, or how killing the bandit king might also involve taking over as the leader of the bandits, etc. Anyways, point being when they are involved in an encounter, the amount of bonus XP they get is multiplied by the GP rating of the event. So while they get XP for stunting while defending the village, they get way more if they pull of some crazy shit while fighting the bandit king or destroying the bandit camp.<br/><br/>You could also add bonus XP or some other sort of benny if they go over the GP target (in the above example, if they teach the villagers to defend themselves (4), kill the bandit king (4+6 = 10), and THEN wipe out the bandit camp (10 + 6 = 16).) This would tempt judiciously powergaming players to make sure to end their level with a major achievement, as that gives them the greatest opportunity to go past the baseline goal.                        </div>

Ah, a good tangent i hadn't really considered! In my experience, with my old D&amp;D gaming group at least, the pacing of the fights, the level of caution vs agressiveness, depends greatly on both who the GM is, and how the scenario is set up. Sometimes we did berzerker rushes through the dungeon, other times careful planning, rule referencing, &amp; preparation - too bad i don't remember how much the party's choice of character classes played into it - or other factors that are easy to control for.<br/><br/><br/>I like the idea of the weighted XP awards (or bonuses), but i have yet to work out how it all comes together.                        </div>
