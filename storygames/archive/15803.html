Nobody, as far as I've ever heard, has ever lost sales from a freely available product or draft, even if the print product they release is exactly the same.  In fact, it's usually the opposite: people find out about your game and start playing it because early drafts are free.  This is especially true if nobody knows you from a hole in the ground: not all of us are Vincent Baker or Ben Lehman.  Putting yourself out there is part of the process of building name recognition and a reputation for making cool stuff.<br/><br/>I design everything in the open, even half-finished things that never get finished, because I like being honest about the design process and sharing the design experience with others, especially if nothing comes of it. As somebody (Vx?) said, the natural endpoint of every game is abandonment, so if I design all by myself, nothing may ever come of it but the stuff in my head. Out in the open, it could inspire somebody else, and sharing ideas and building off others is how the medium advances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358853/#Comment_358853" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T06:25:14+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  6:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One potential downside of being totally open about drafts - those drafts will be out in the wild and people will play them in lieu of purchasing the finished game sometimes.

I know a bunch of people in Seattle who still play the alpha version of Geiger Counter, for example.  Sage and Adam will probably have similar issues with Dungeon World, but that game is meant to be easily hackable anyway.  Honestly, I don't see that as a problem, really (at least not as much as the issue Jason mentions).  People are still playing your game, whatever version they're playing.<br/><br/>Jason's other point is right on too.  It took more than a year after the alpha of Geiger Counter was released for it to get significant play, and I was pretty active in the indie games community for 3-4 years before that.  It takes patience and time to gain people's attention and for them to spent their valuable time on your game when there are a bunch of others out there that they'd probably prefer to be playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358869/#Comment_358869" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T08:24:35+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  8:24AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>One potential downside of being totally open about drafts - those drafts will be out in the wild and people will play them in lieu of purchasing the finished game sometimes.

While running AW, I'm constantly confused with Hx, Driver and healing rules, simply because I played the game with three variants of the rules, and all of them kinda fused into one in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359301/#Comment_359301" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T10:15:43+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 10:15AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben - whether PDF or App, we've tried to take a software approach (Sage and I are both, by profession, computer nerds) to our releases, gathering changes to the beta in point form and releasing patch notes whenever we update the game.  <br/><br/>Once the full version of the game is out, the Red Book and Hack will likely become unavailable and only the final version will be around for official access.  People will still have Beta X PDFs floating around, I'm sure, and maybe some of them will choose to play that instead of the full version, but the full version will have polish and changes that aren't in the Beta, too.  *shrug* We're finding, so far, that the benefits of a semi-open system (the Adventurer's Guild) outweigh our general concerns of people getting our game for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359315/#Comment_359315" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T10:46:32+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 10:46AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made my second game, Anima Prime, available from the first alpha version.

I was also contacted by an artist who had played a beta and was excited to contribute art. So it was a total success story.<br/><br/>If you want to see a much bigger achievement, look at Evil Hat. They put FATE out for free, creating a huge fanbase over the years, which translated into making Spirit of the Century and later FATE games massive successes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359318/#Comment_359318" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T10:57:09+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 10:57AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, the system that Adam and I use:<br/><br/>-Free "Hack" version which requires AW to play.<br/>-Basic version available for pay while we finish up the full thing.<br/>-Full version in Beta available to anyone who shares thoughts about the Hack or Basic version<br/><br/>It's been marvelous.

I'm okay with that.  Obviously I want them to buy our game, but I also recognize that it's a thing that'll happen.<br/><br/>More often than not, just personal-anecdotally, I'll buy a game I enjoyed the beta of whether I "need" to or not.
