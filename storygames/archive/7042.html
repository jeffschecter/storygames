Remember, most Americans have no direct connection (or knowledge) of their country's foreign adventures.<br/><br/>It seems to me that DnD addresses more "everyman" issues in American culture, such as:<br/><br/>Racism is okay, because its all true!<br/><br/>Violence is a meaningful, constructive solution to the problems the players must face.<br/><br/>Players do not need to know anything about the outside world (the dungeon) before they go mucking about in it, but that's okay, because discovery is part of the fun!<br/><br/>Also, I think the "points of light" approach supports these issues much better. You are right, dungeon exploration is very close to imperialism, but the new approach supports the heroic ideal in America, where one man with a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">gun</span> big sword really can make a difference. This more closely represents the history of the game as played, and the culture surrounding it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156620/#Comment_156620" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T07:30:05+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  7:30AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2008 7:31AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, the moment I saw the thread title I wanted to mention you've "accused" me of this, and then I see I get mentioned...<br/><br/>Well, games are games to be played, and games as an artistic expression?<br/>And sometimes with both, we create them to explore our issues.<br/><br/>I think it happens a lot less in many of those Trad games, because they were created by committee, as it were, so a lot of one person's personal baggage was lost or diluted.

His issues may be about the effects of foreign currency influx, he may want to spread a meme about war being wrong, while exploring an issue that asks whether or not it is wrong.<br/>And of course, as stated above, he can wish to explore a certain issue, and will spread its meme, but it also brings forth related memes, which he will spread, but is not interested in exploring.<br/><br/>Etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156628/#Comment_156628" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T07:55:08+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  7:55AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The design goal of GURPS - one system for every game.<br/><br/>Why? The designer was obviously, at the start of his gaming career, forced to learn new games at a break-neck speed, and then punished for his lack of system mastery. I can imagine the author as a young man, mercilessly defeated at a new tactical wargame by grey-haired fiends every week or so. He sticks with it, because this mirrors his childhood experience with board games - always being beaten by older siblings, aunts and uncles, who demonstrated a much higher mastery of the rules and used it to mock our poor author.<br/><br/>Then he moves on to roleplaying games. This is back in the day when all games have more or less the same setup, but all games have various fiddly rules, charts and tables, that other people use to shame and humiliate the author. So he designs his own system which he can use for any setting, so he will never have to learn a new set of rules.<br/><br/>[who wrote the original GURPS rules?

Given how protagonism is kind of vulnerable, to have the guts to go for it in just a pure war game structure is...pretty gung ho. In an admirable, but slightly dangerous way. When people don't understand the emotions it raises, it's slightly dangerous. We have somewhat more of an understanding today. Back then I don't think anyone realised just how pissed off they'd get at 'No, your character wouldn't choose that' and suchlike until it happened, and when it did happen, it was mixed up with so many emotions and cultural expectations it'd take often take decades to straighten out. So...gung ho.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
