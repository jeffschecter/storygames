It works like this. <br/><br/>The elements of the central economy are:<br/> - SAN, a score from 0-100 representing your sanity level. At 0, you're out of the game; losing more than 5 at once also inflicts an insanity condition on your character. You lose it by learning Things Man Was Not Meant To Know (TMWNMTK, see below), casting spells, doing crazy-person things like shooting your friends, or undergoing terrible stresses. You get it back, a little at a time, by successfully holding back the darkness for one more day, or by advancing a skill to 90%, up to a max of (the lower of 100-Cthulhu Mythos or 5x your POW stat (see below for both)). Odds are good that you lose it faster than you get it back, though. SAN loss is a death-spiral mechanic - the lower your SAN, the easier it is to lose more.<br/> <br/> - the Cthulhu Mythos skill, representing your knowledge of TMWNMTK. Gaining Mythos inevitably comes from losing SAN, because you read a book or saw a thing that revealed a terrible truth incompatible with the consensus worldview (and your tiny monkey brain). But you NEED to know this stuff to stay alive, because it really is the truth, so  veteran investigators are always balancing their precarious SAN against enough Mythos savvy to survive one more day. In the fiction this knowledge takes the form of things that, if you tell them to a psychiatrist, will get you treated or committed.<br/> <br/> - spells, a list of intermittently useful magical things you can do. Bad, boring Cthulhu means replacing guns with <i>Withering</i>; good, fun Cthulhu means flying through space on the back of a <i>summoned and bound</i> Byakhee, or reducing a <i>resurrected</i> wizard to his vital salts, or using <i>Withering</i> instead of a gun, knowing the costs, to make it easier to get away with a murder. If a PC does that last, you need to make sure to follow up with the <i>Unspeakable Oath</i> - you win! Maybe, on that character's way down, it would be fun to deconstruct the evil sorcerer archetype...<br/><br/> - POW, your innate magical power, a score usually from 3-18. This is your starting and usual max MP (see below), and many magical effects key on it. Some very cool spells call for a permanent expenditure of POW.<br/><br/> - MP, your magic points, which you spend to cast spells. If this goes to 0, you're unconscious, and it goes without saying that there are spells and effects that drain MP, so between keeping the PCs casting and including drain effects, MP is a front that the GM can certainly use to exert pressure.<br/> <br/> - HP, hit points, which for most PCs will be in the teens. Two gunshots, or one critical hit with a gun, will kill many PCs - they're pretty fragile. HPs usually come back between adventures. It goes without saying that at 0HP, you're out of the game.<br/> <br/>CoC is built around driving characters toward 0 SAN. If you do that, you'll get your Lovecraftian vibe. But it's only really fun if the PCs effectively <i>spend</i> their SAN, because of choices they make. Punishing them with SAN loss is stupid and not-fun; the worst CoC GM move, which I've been guily of a few times, is to have a PC open a closet and WHOOPS ELDER GOD IN THERE LOSE d100 SAN! Remember that SAN loss is a reward for making a Cthulhu story, a sign from the GM that you're all on the same page about the genre, and not a punishment.<br/> <br/>So, how do you, the GM, give the PCs the opportunity to spend their SAN? Obviously, you RAILROAD THEM! Seriously, most CoC published material is awful illusionist crap. OK, one more try.<br/><br/>How do you give the PCs the opportunity to spend their SAN? The usual way is to put pressure on the characters' HP via supernatural danger. It doesn't take much, since (as previously noted) most PCs can't survive two gunshots. To get out of danger, they need knowledge, raising their Mythos skill, and probably spells. Once they warm to magic, make sure that you push its associated dangers too. Then, to preserve their HP, they'll spend SAN to increase Mythos. They'll expend MP and probably POW to leverage their Mythos knowledge via spells, but that too will cost them SAN. In other words, as they learn TMWNMTK, truths they need to survive, their minds will crumble at the revelation. The central economy in the mechanics underwrites the cosmic horror fiction.<br/><br/>Doing it without railroading is not hard. Try following Vincent's town-creation rules, basically. What is the immediate threat? (Special genre question: Why might you need magic or Mythos secrets to defeat it?) Who wants what to happen as part of that threat? What will happen (and when) if the PCs don't get involved? When I recommend Pagan's <i>More Tales of Terror</i>, it's because it supports this style of prep so nicely. <i>You don't have to commit to an explanation at the beginning, only to the events.</i> See what the group is driving toward and play with their expectation, whether that means fulfilling it or subverting it. <br/><br/>The best published adventures (e.g. Chaosium's "A Cult of One", Pagan's "Night Floors") support that style of play with a bunch of well-fleshed out prompts to help when play gets stuck, but open structures. But only a few can be the best, right?<br/><br/>Alternately, you could start with nothing at all, or close to. When a PC does something expecting to find a clue, fish instead. Once you've fished a few times, build a threat in play. With a highly genre-savvy group, this works well, and if (like me) you're a fan of lazy GMing, it's the most fun way to play.<br/><br/>In the other thread, I said that the best spell in the game as far as I'm concerned is <i>Call Power of Nyambe</i>, which (IIRC) costs 1 POW, 0MP, and some token SAN, and gives you d10MP, which you can use to cast other spells. I trust everyone can now see why I love it so.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268860/#Comment_268860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T13:19:37+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  1:19PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>So, how do you, the GM, give the PCs the opportunity to spend their SAN?

When HPL's protagonists buy another day for the ignorant world, it's never as simple as shooting something or blowing it up. The closest I can think is "The Shadow Over Innsmouth", and even then, the narrator points out that the cult isn't localized to Innsmouth, that the problem isn't solved, and that even getting to that point had a steep cost in sanity. (And think for a moment about the poor military men responsible for clearing out Innsmouth - there's a pretty neat short story in one of the DG fiction collections about their plight.) There's a case for "The Dunwich Horror", I guess, as a problem that gets more or less squared away, but in that case, it's done with secrets and magic. On the whole, nothing gets solved, no one is happy, and the problem will be back.</blockquote>\nIn Call of Cthulhu, the guy runs into Cthulhu with a boat, world saved, the end.<br/><br/>The "but the problem still lurks out there!" is no more relevant to the story than the panel of the Joker giggling away in his cell at Arkham at the end of a Batman comic.  It's atmosphere - and good atmosphere, don't get me wrong - but it doesn't make the decisions of the characters meaningless.  If they did, we wouldn't be interested in the decisions and the stories would be utter failures.<br/><br/>The main book lists monsters that, for the most part, are defeated rather handily with shotguns and dynamite. In most of the published scenarios (including a lot of Pagan scenarios), they remain defeatable with shotguns and dynamite.  The exceptions are out there!  And a campaign that honored and put those center stage would be very cool.  But let's not pretend that the game doesn't encompass the other approach too.<br/><br/>Besides, there never was any such thing as "illusionism", any more than when I don't figure out a stage magician's trick I default to saying "welp, it must be magic".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268870/#Comment_268870" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T14:01:53+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  2:01PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>In Call of Cthulhu, the guy runs into Cthulhu with a boat, world saved, the end.</blockquote>\nNot really. Cthulhu still lives, waiting to rise when the stars are right. It's a very temporary victory.<br/><br/>The "problem still lurking" is, I think, extremely relevant in Lovecraft. It's the whole point. Everything the protagonist has done is, at the end, meaningless. I find that rather terrifying.<br/><br/>Chris, when you say "When a PC does something expecting to find a clue, fish instead", do you mean "Ask the player what they discover"?

We've crossed up this way before and it took someone, I think Andy, like a hundred comments to sort out who was talking to whom at one point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The way I see it there are two genuinely collaborative sorts of ways to run Cthulhu - let's call them the Dogs Town method and the Fishing method - plus another way, where it's just the Keeper telling a story to the players (Steve, how about "CoC was successful and enjoyable because it tended to attract storyteller GMs, and module writers who wrote good fiction"?). That already has a name, illusionism, and I know it appeals to some groups. (Jason, it's just a name, a term of art. We all know very well what it is and how it works or doesn't; if you prefer, we can call it something less pejorative, as long as we understand it to mean "The GM writes the story, and you're free to act in it".) But it exerts that appeal, I think, at the cost of not really being any different from someone (the module writer/GM) writing a story, and I get plenty of that from my reading. I need something else in my game, and from the existence of this here site here, I gather I'm not alone.<br/><br/>Graham, the Dogs Town method is how I usually run CoC because people are comfortable with it, and it allows me to get everyone on the same page with my big contribution to the game, whereas the Fishing method means that we have to somehow, emergently, find our way onto the same page if we don't start that way. Going with the Dogs Town method lets me bring less-intimate player groups together, which is a good thing. But to me, there's a problem with it. I HATE HATE HATE needing to know the answer. Hate it! I want to discover the answer to the (or at least a) mystery just like everyone else. I want to be surprised and delighted by it too, and if I prepare, I know I run a risk of getting married to some outcome. If I come to the table with no fiction at all, just system mastery plus the genre conventions in a big ominous cloud, and Fish like crazy instead of trying to write the first quarter of a short story, then I get what I want out of the session too; I get the unexpected. I know that there are other GMs who really enjoy knowing the answer and parceling it out over the course of a session, and I don't hold it against them, but ideally, I'm not that guy. I am a dirty hippie. Do people in England still say "It's a fair cop"? I learned to speak English from <i>Monty Python</i>, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>I wonder to what extent my sole-Keepership is what pushed me out to that extreme of dirt and hippiness. No one else in our group ever ran CoC very well (as they always point out when I try to slip out of the job); no one else had the same kind of relationship with HPL's fiction as me. Maybe if I'd gotten to play Cthulhu and not GM sometimes, I wouldn't have been so desperate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268880/#Comment_268880" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T16:00:38+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  4:00PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After that last blast, let me emphasize that I usually run CoC the Dogs Town way, where I do know a lot of things about the situation before we begin play.

Of course CoC is going to look like a good game if you play it like Sorcerer, to put it simply.<br/><br/>The above is based on familiarity with Chaosium texts, mostly - for all I know Pagan puts the game on its head and effectively rewrites the dynamics of how and why you use the various rules subsystems (which I think Colin describes accurately) in some sourcebook that I've never read. I sort of doubt that, though - to me it seems that CoC is successful in catering to its fans exactly because it is railroady, well-researched (by rpg standards) storytelling with the GM as the head honcho. Any sort of discussion of the range of solutions the players might exercise to the scenarios is carefully limited to whether the monster got away.<br/><br/>I do admit that the issue of game text critique is tricky with traditional games that are, I believe, intentionally written to embrace variety and GM autonomy. Should I judge CoC based on a) its own play advice, which is very incoherent; b) the best practices of the best GMs, which might not resemble the game text at all; c) solely the mechanics, assuming that I would be implementing them as a part of a total game system where I supply the non-mechanical parts of system myself to accord with my own tastes. If we go by b) or c) in game text critique, then the critique comes to be about much more than what is written or intended by the game's creator, and most games will be entirely valid and commendable - there's always somebody out there who got a highly functional and fun game out of any game text with selective reading and the right local conditions. Most significantly, because almost any game dynamics can be implemented without mechanics as the American textual tradition recognizes them, we might argue that the ultimate roleplaying game is the one that does not have rules at all; this is a known practical stance among freeformers.<br/><br/>I'm not very serious about undermining Colin - I think it's great that he's managed to brew a fun game out of the glorious mess that is Call of Cthulhu, and his game seems pretty fun to me. I do also think that it's good to be critical of even a game you've played successfully. I've had fun with Cthulhu myself as well when I played it regularly in the '90s, but I wouldn't ascribe that to the game text as a game. At most the fun I've garnered from playing CoC has been due to the game's evocative fiction, and even more likely it's been because the group in toto has been willing and unified in our wish to play a horror rpg, with CoC as an incidental freeloader in our play.<br/><br/>Getting a functional CoC-equivalent that'd make justice to the visions of the game's many scenarios is something that I'd love to do at some point. I'm somewhat sceptical of any claims that the game is already excellent and I should just learn to play it correctly, as it seems that any such claims rely on effectively rewriting the game's non-mechanical procedures, player roles and play goals extensively. At least write it down and put it out as a supplement so I can review the correct method of play at leisure as what effectively amounts to a new game text. Bonus points if the new method involves a conversion guide for how to make something like <i>At the Mountains of Madness</i> more than a year-long railroad with one tricky choice at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268887/#Comment_268887" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T17:19:28+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  5:19PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I happened to read <i>Night Floors</i> recently, so I can actually say something about it. I agree with Colin in that the scenario in question is remarkably non-atrocious when viewed through the lens of investigative narrativistic roleplaying. I didn't realize it when reading it, but that whole scenario really isn't much more than a problem, a deadline and some freaky shit to keep the players engaged for a while. I don't know how it would run in practice; it might run counter to what some players expect that there really, genuinely is nothing that the characters actually gain or achieve by delving into the night floors - the "correct" solution from a challenge-overcoming viewpoint is to just demolish the whole building without ever engaging the scenario, but the players won't know this before they go there and get their characters killed by going to Carcosa (nobody in the scenario spells it out that the woman they're trying to rescue is already beyond redemption, it seems to me) or whatever. In fact, if run strictly by the book, it seems to me that players might fail to realize the ultimate meaninglessness of the place, because nobody and nothing in the scenario is going to tell them. Most players I know would probably try to find the sixth floor, the encyclopedia salesman and the woman they're looking for, all without realizing that to do so means <i>automatic</i> madness and death. Not fun if it all comes over as "try to read my mind, suckers" - which is what CoC scenarios often seem to be about.<br/><br/>Detaching the above from the my overall understanding of the goals and technique of running CoC, it does look like a rather feasible horror scenario in the vein Colin suggests. I think it's pretty illustrative that I managed to read through the whole thing without ever considering how it would actually be used in play - there's such a lack of explicit procedures or even stated goals of play in CoC that I apparently have grown able to read these game scenarios purely as literature, not connecting the texts into anything resembling practical play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268902/#Comment_268902" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T21:43:04+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  9:43PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2010 10:14PM by ccreitz.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Should I judge CoC based on a) its own play advice, which is very incoherent; b) the best practices of the best GMs, which might not resemble the game text at all; c) solely the mechanics, assuming that I would be implementing them as a part of a total game system where I supply the non-mechanical parts of system myself to accord with my own tastes.</blockquote> I actually diked out a paragraph from that post, one that I wrote about my terrible anger at CoC's GM advice.

I don't want to imply that good things should be willfully ignored out of bitterness when I ask for realism in celebrating games that are, frankly, written in pretty suspect ways at times - especially when the actual gatekeepers of the games prove intractable and disinterested in seeking to improve and enrichen the game texts like Chaosium has done through CoC's six all but identical editions. Still, a modicum of critique is warranted in that if we are to improve in our understanding and design (for those of us interested in game design), we have to be able to confess to the short-comings in the games we have. I often say that CoC has at least three separate games within the same covers, welded forcefully together out of lack of understanding or willfull commercial exploitation; getting rid of this state of affairs would be the first step to modernizing the game to my tastes, I should think.<br/><br/>I have an interest in the question of game texts vs. game culture, as I myself spent my first ten years in the roleplaying hobby largely disconnected from the larger world. In that sort of condition, which to my mind should be assumed as typical for new roleplayers, the game text is your only friend and the fact that somebody somewhere has wretched a functional game out of the incontradictory mess is a rather dim comfort for the rest of us. The viewpoint must be different when you've paid your dues and learned to utilize the unruly beast that is the game to your satisfaction. The quirks and incoherencies of the actual game text become ignorable background noise when you actually know which parts to take seriously and what you're doing with the game.<br/><br/>Insofar as the game mechanics of CoC go, objectively speaking, there is much good game design in there. The game has plenty of dross to my tastes, but the bits Colin highlights are all there and interesting. My own experience of practice is that the dross tends to scatter a group's attention and increase the risk of inefficient play when you get stuck comparing the damage potentials of rifles vs. shotguns or distributing points into Spot Hidden vs. Climb, but I'm sure that the reduced game that ignores all the "sim-by-default" as it's often called is actually pretty strongly to the point. It's a shame that I can't bring myself to even try to create characters for a game like CoC at this late date, it's almost a physical illness I get from the idea of distributing however many hundreds of points over a list of fifty skills with contradictory instructions as to the methodology I should be using to do it. No more two-hour chargen sessions for me, thanks.<br/><br/>What all this indicates to me is that Call of Cthulhu desperately needs new game texts that go beyond scenario writing and actually explicitly branch out the multitudes of potential games lurking in the hidden potential of the GMing culture of the game. I'm sure that the dedicated players of the game would have wisdom for the rest of us, if only they wrote it all down into rules and procedures. <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> is in the right direction in this regard, as is some of the Pagan stuff (I'm thinking of the <i>Hastur Cycle</i> stuff in <i>Delta Green: Countdown</i> which I've been reading lately), although I have to say that none of what I've seen so far really satisfies me in terms of productization: nowadays I have a very wide range of supremely honed, honest game texts to play with, so that tends to be the standard against which I measure game texts. Most CoC material is supremely beautiful prose but primitive as gaming material in comparison, I find.<br/><br/>Hmm, I distinctly remember blogging about this a couple of years ago... ah, <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/11/18/what-say-you-cthulhu/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Seems that I was about as lost on this topic then as I am now: I love the Lovecraftian literature, I adore the ideas in CoC fluff, but the rules systems don't go nearly far enough in clarity and simplicity for me to actually play these things at this late date. I'll clearly need to get off my rump at some point and make a game or two to satisfy my personal limitations in engaging CoC. Ideally something that allows me to leverage the ginormous existing literature of tragically railroady, supremely detailed, imaginative CoC scenario material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268907/#Comment_268907" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T22:39:22+00:00" title="April 25, 2010 10:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Not really.

Yet nobody would say that those temporary victories are meaningless.  There's a lot of verbiage in Lovecraft how the occult weirdness of the universe functions so far beyond the lives and cares of mankind that all our efforts in life are pointless, but the stories themselves are constructed in such a way as to put the lie to that. We strongly identify with the horror and fear experienced by the protagonists because we are imagining how we would react to the horribly alien world of the Great Old Ones. If the stories ever really convinced us that what the protagonists were doing was pointless, we wouldn't ever re-read them and indeed would feel absolutely cheated that we had ever wasted a second on them. Even in other stories where the last chapter is "and he woke up and it was all a terrible dream", the activities and feelings of the characters in the dream-world still have dramatic meaning.  No, in both CoC scenarios and Lovecraft's works, humanity defeats the horrors of the universe quite a lot - without acknowledging that victory, the central conflict of the stories are pointless and the stories would be wastes of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268912/#Comment_268912" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T01:33:57+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  1:33AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2010 1:53AM by GB_Steve.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That it's a waste of time is part of what makes it glorious.

It's about discovering dire secrets that reveal something dark about man's own nature or history, then surviving to tell the tale, probably from your sanitorium cell. It's about the sense of hopelessness in reality, about shaking your confidence in human nature. So many other tales tell you 'the creatures out there are strong, but the human spirit is indomitable!' Lovecraft says 'The creatures out there are strong, and you are a pitiful wretch. Deal with it.' Personally, I feel that in a gameplay scenario the squiggly horrors actually just get in the way of that. People have a predisposition to try and destroy them because games typically have such goals in mind. In a true Lovecraft story, the protagonist is lucky to escape with life and sanity intact and doesn't even think about trying to kill anything.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a game, such writing doesn't really lend itself to long, drawn-out campaigns. It's more a situation where you make a new character for every storyline you play, usually because the last one was eaten or driven mad. And I don't think there's any shame in that at all. I don't think CoC is inherently flawed, it's just a game designed for shorter scenarios than the other games it happens to hang out with.

It's raging against the fading of the light.</blockquote>\nI'm almost with you on this, except that <i>the light never actually goes out.</i>  Oh, sure, there's a lot of talk about how the Great Old Ones are implacable and immortal and inscrutable and inevitable, but there isn't a published story that ends "...and so all the insignificant acts of men were thrown down, and mad chaos scattered the tawdry remnants of human civilization like so much dust."  There's always another story to be told, and while the fight in that next story is always billed as just being another speed bump thrown in the path of unstoppable universal destruction, there's more stories after THAT one, too.<br/><br/>Lovecraft's stories just aren't the relentlessly dreary and nihilistic things some people seem to be trying to categorize them as.  Sure, in the big picture, to stand up against the unnameable horrors from beyond space and time is an act of sheer futility...but the big picture is <i>not</i> where the story is.  The story is about the people who stand up, and Lovecraft was a canny enough pulp writer to know that the people who stand up in the face of ridiculous odds <i>must</i> win something, even if it costs them their lives or their souls to do it.  Even if he winked at the readers and told them that it won't really matter a thousand years from now, he didn't seem to have a problem with letting some of his protagonists scratch out a win against the eldritch horrors here and there.  Really, while the overall Cthulhu Mythos is ostensibly about a war that humans will lose in the end, many of the stories he wrote are about the battles fought in that war, and the good guys are allowed to (in fact, <i>required to</i>) keep winning those as long as it can be made into an entertaining and exciting tale for the audience.  And on that level, it doesn't matter if you think it's entertaining and exciting in its own right, or if you think it's entertaining and exciting because Lovecraft is stage-whispering "spoiler alert: everyone dies anyway when the Stars Are Right" in the last paragraph: a win is a win, whether it's futile or not.<br/><br/>I can't help but think that painting all of Lovecraft's work with the same bleak brush -- "oh, you poor fools, you can never find success: pain and madness and failure are all you shall ever get for your efforts" -- is just <i>wrong</i>.  And it's not exactly a recipe for an entertaining game, either.  But tacking a bleak, ominous epilogue onto any success ("Innsmouth is purged, but the Deep Ones breed elsewhere")...well, that's awesome.  That's a wonderful way to tie into the atmosphere of the stories, as well as an obvious hook drawing people toward the next catastrophe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268925/#Comment_268925" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T04:23:57+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  4:23AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>Anyway, as a game, such writing doesn't really lend itself to long, drawn-out campaigns.

I've been on a pretty textualist swing through the last decade, though, and at some point I read through a couple of editions of CoC just to look at what the game really tells you to do when playing it. I have to say that I saw almost no strictly dramatic Lovecraft emulation in it, while the campaign-focused, slowly opening exploration of the Mythos was a definite centerpiece both in player and GMing advice. The player text is pretty clear in that you're trying to keep your character alive and succeed in the mission, while the GM text is clear in that the idea of the game is to craft a long-term campaign out of the slowly revealed horror and the developing purpose of the PCs as a foil for the Mythos. That is, the assumption is that the player characters form a supernatural detective agency that amasses institutional prestige and knowledge, even if individual characters should fall by the wayside. The idea of non-adventuring player characters who are only used for one scenario is not evident.<br/><br/>Considering the evidence, I have to conclude that the one-shot game of spiraling, consensual madness is simply not there in the text. We just assume that it would be due to prior familiarity with Lovecraft stories. Just look at this thread, full of analysis about how Lovecraft wrote and what it all meant, like that had something to do with the game of CoC as presented.<br/><br/>(Insofar as my opinion on the literary angle interests, I have to say that Lovecraft is a moderately complex writer, and most significantly one that did not expect for all of his work to be summed together into one tidy roleplaying game package. Thus these reductionist discussions about what Lovecraft is "really about" go nowhere because the oeuvre is not nearly as consistent as Call of Cthulhu pretends. The reductionist idea that a real core of Lovecraftianism lurks somewhere out there is imposed on the material by the roleplaying game, and therefore trying to discuss such a core in isolation from the rpg text is foolish. Better than to ask what Lovecraft is about is to ask what the CoC roleplaying game is about, for the latter might even come to a conclusion of some sort.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268926/#Comment_268926" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T04:24:34+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  4:24AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ken Hite calls it "the Man who Shot Joseph Curwen"  in that the Mythos in these games is the same as the Gun in the Western.<br/><br/>I thought the HPL line, or at least for me, is, in many cases, that before you start you are doomed because that which horrifies you is already part of you.<br/><br/>In Graham's Cthulhu Apocalypse, the light gets very close to going out.

A bit more:<br/><br/>I don't get this apocalyptic angle on Lovecraft. The greatest Lovecraft stories are consistently about disturbing imagery, individuals lured by the abnormal and broken worldviews. I don't really see where this has anything to do with the dying of the light or some sort of concerted struggle against darkness. Seems to me like that's all projected from CoC. Critiquing Lovecraft for not proffering genuine consequences of failure, progressive monster apocalypse or any of that stuff seems besides the point when nothing of the sort is promised in the works. The alien cosmogony is out there in many stories, but outside Derleth stories it rarely is some malevolent force that is actively going to come and eat you unless somebody stops it. If the protagonists of the stories weren't like moths to the flame, they'd never come face to face with the horror.<br/><br/>I've often said that Call of Cthulhu is one of the most important roleplaying games when it comes to literary credentials. I do not merely mean the game's high level of literary scholasticism, but also the fact that the game has transformed a whole generation's understanding of the original pulp horror. In many ways the CoC vision of what Lovecraft is gets to be more important than the original work, especially among gamers. The game's ability to supercede the author in this way speaks of how powerful the vision proffered by the game is, I think. It's not arbitrary, you can sort of almost see it in the original works if you squint a little and throw away the majority of the stories that feature no action scenes, leaving only the titular <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> and <i>The Shadow over Innsmouth</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268933/#Comment_268933" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T05:34:31+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  5:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>I'm almost with you on this, except that<i>the light never actually goes out.</i>Oh, sure, there's a lot of talk about how the Great Old Ones are implacable and immortal and inscrutable and inevitable, but there isn't a published story that ends "...and so all the insignificant acts of men were thrown down, and mad chaos scattered the tawdry remnants of human civilization like so much dust."  There's always another story to be told, and while the fight in that next story is always billed as just being another speed bump thrown in the path of unstoppable universal destruction, there's more stories after THAT one, too.</blockquote>\nI'd like for this to be true, but it isn't.\n<blockquote><cite>Written By: H.P. Lovecraft, in "Nyarlathotep"</cite>I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary marching formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them. Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to show where the tramways had run. And again we saw a tram-car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its side. When we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by the river, and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top. Then we split up into narrow columns, each of which seemed drawn in a different direction. One disappeared in a narrow alley to the left, leaving only the echo of a shocking moan. Another filed down a weed-choked subway entrance, howling with a laughter that was mad. My own column was sucked toward the open country, and presently I felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn; for as we stalked out on the dark moor, we beheld around us the hellish moon-glitter of evil snows. Trackless, inexplicable snows, swept asunder in one direction only, where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls. The column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf. I lingered behind, for the black rift in the green-litten snow was frightful, and I thought I had heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished; but my power to linger was slight. As if beckoned by those who had gone before, I half-floated between the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the sightless vortex of the unimaginable.</blockquote>\nAt the end of "Nyarlathotep," the narrator follows a mesmerized file of fellow citizens out of a ruined city, into the countryside, and through a gateway, where they witness "the unimaginable":\n<blockquote>Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can tell. A sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands, and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation, corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low. Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things; half-seen columns of unsanctifled temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness. And through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond Time; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate gods the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is Nyarlathotep.</blockquote>\nTo view that ending as anything but final strikes me as taking cock-eyed optimism to the point of absurdity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268935/#Comment_268935" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T05:48:14+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  5:48AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But then it's also probably a mistake to view HPL's output as some kind of coherent whole. Sometimes the narrator dies, sometimes he runs of screaming (because he's seen, or has worked out he is, a monster), sometimes it just all goes away.<br/><br/>The CoC approach is difficult to square with the original texts, not in the least because you have more than one (at most two) protagonists and there's a group dynamic that you have to contend with (although the Trail of Cthulhu purist approach, in particular Graham's excellent scenarios move back closer to HPL).<br/><br/>I'm not objecting to someone doing something different with the concepts.

It's chosen by the player and is the reason why the character doesn't run off and find the police at the merest hint of trouble. So it can be Curiosity or Lucre or Duty etc. A player can refuse to follow the drive but the character loses sanity as a result. There's even a reward (a "dubious stunted carrot") for characters which follow their drive. As long as there is plenty to do on the train, the railroad is not a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268943/#Comment_268943" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T06:34:20+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  6:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>So, how do you, the GM, give the PCs the opportunity to spend their SAN?

This is clearly a matter of taste, about which we are told there can be no argument. It seems clear that Colin prefers player-empowering dirty-hippie procedures, while you are content with mystery-preserving, experientially oriented, information-asymmetric old school play. So far so good. I am willing to hear a conversation played out on those terms.<br/><br/>However, I want to throw a flag on your "argument from popularity," to wit, if so many people have played it, it must be good. That just doesn't follow. There are lots of reasons why a thing may become popular other than sheer quality. Network effects, for one (e.g., "first mover advantage"). The reason why I'm typing this on a QWERTY keyboard is not because this particular layout is efficient or optimal; there are other layouts that would let most people type faster. As you know, QWERTY was developed to slow down typists so that typewriter keys wouldn't jam. And once people started to be trained as QWERTY typists, there was little incentive to switch to another layout, even when the mechanics of keyboards would support it. Network effects.<br/><br/>So I'd argue that a more nuanced explanation of CoC's popularity is called for, one that took into account not only its merits as a game (including the textual ambiguity that accommodates multiple play styles, from seriously thematic role-playing to explosives-laden cult-busting), but also its relatively early arrival on the RPG scene, its positioning as the anti-D&amp;D, and its tapping of that rich vein of geek-catnip, Lovecraft's "Yog-Sothery."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268944/#Comment_268944" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T07:22:18+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  7:22AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree. Many people have played CoC, and kept doing so, even in the light of massive inertia from the publishing company. Of course, now that everybody and their ancestor is bringing out a Mythos game, it becomes less of an issue, but during the dark days, CoC was largely kept alive by other publishing companies and a critical mass of enthusiasts on both sides of the Atlantic. And why did they keep at it? For the reasons you list amongst others.<br/><br/>My appeal to popularity was more of a shortcut rather than an examination of the reasons for this popularity. D&amp;D is a very different kettle of fish, because of its massive domination of the market. Perhaps if Vincent had been 20 years older, we'd all be watching Dogs in the Vineyard movies and playing games by Gunslingers of the Coast.<br/><br/>Coming back to the economy of the game, I'd argue that forcing an economy on Mythos gaming moves the game away from the way I play the game. My concerns are what my character thinks and how he reacts rather than whether I'm getting rewarded by the system, with an eye to producing some kind of aesthetically pleasing story for the present audience (i.e. all the players). This is also coupled with the thrill of not necessarily ever discovering the truth. All that SAN does it remind you of how mad you're supposed to be acting.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, the Dogs game I've most run is Fort Lemon which has a strong horror undercurrent which the PCs slowly discover as they talk to those involved.

This seem like a big barrier for your MP-POW economy. The game make it hard to have a point of contact with the MP-POW, and it seem likely that some/most characters wont have access to this economy. Reading tomes is, indeed, usually a downtime activity - you can sometimes stretch time within a session, of course. "OK, so for the next week, you guys will be tracking down Somov, while you stay in the library and read the <i>Fragments</i>." Sometimes you, the GM, arrange for faster reads - if a spell is explicitly spelled out in a PowerPoint presentation designed to bring new cultists up to speed, or brushed in bloody headprints against a prison-cell wall*, a few hours should do it.<br/><br/>Then there's magic/alien tech. Sometimes, the Mi-Go surgically alter your memory, sometimes because they think you asked (and maybe you did!). Sometimes, you cast one spell to learn another, or to learn more terrible secrets (see <i>Unspeakable Oath</i>, another favorite spell of mine, and the <i>Contact</i> spells). Sometimes, you've spend some time back in time, a prisoner/guest of the Great Race, and you can remember something you learned from their library. Sometimes, you learn directly from bitter experience of the unnatural. <br/><br/>So not every Mythos secret comes from months of poring over the <i>Necronomicon</i>, nor is every adventure is incompatible with spending months poring over it. Characters should certainly be able to increase Mythos, and learn spells, in play.<br/><br/>* I feel confident about "consider point expenditures to be flags" as a best practice. This is a live example. A player had put a ton of points into a couple of obscure languages - that's a flag! I'm thinking about how we might bring it into play. The initial situation is that a prisoner, responsible for a string of occult-connected crimes, disappeared from his locked cell. So as we do the introduction to the session, we figure that the investigator is the only US Marshall who knows Old Gothic (or whatever it was that the prisoner smeared onto the wall). I determine that we can have fun with failure or success - maybe failure lets me teach this poor dude some completely random disastrous spell that they can spend a session cleaning up, like maybe he correctly understands the <i>summon</i> but not the <i>bind</i> for some kind of nasty horror. But he succeeds instead, so we don't really explore the possibilities. Success lets him follow the prisoner, and since we've been developing Carcosa-related themes, off we go...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268989/#Comment_268989" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T11:34:53+00:00" title="April 26, 2010 11:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Funnily enough, the Dogs game I've most run is Fort Lemon which has a strong horror undercurrent which the PCs slowly discover as they talk to those involved.

I feel like it's a communications tool, a way to modulate the game's themes of isolation, futility, desperation, terror, and revelation.

I'd honestly forgotten that story, to the point where I honestly have no idea what leads up to that ending.  (Or even if it took place on the present-day Earth!)<br/><br/>That's not the typical Lovecraft ending, though, so I'll stand by my position that his stories do not often come to final apocalyptic endings, and that it is a mistake to overemphasize the dreary hopelessness of humanity's struggle in the face of the certain doom approaching them, and the pointlessness of trying to stave off the inevitable.  It shouldn't feel inevitable and pointless to the protagonists, and their best efforts should not uniformly end in disillusionment and despair: they <i>can</i> win within their story, although it will probably be hard on them in every possible way to do so.  (And then you trot out the 1950's B-horror stinger, flashing a big "THE END?" up on the screen over a shot of the evil hand/tentacle-thing pushing its way out of its own grave, to menace the world again tomorrow...which isn't saying "look how futile this was," but rather, "look at the new adventure coming your way!")<br/><br/>And more to the point, if you're going to play a game with your friends about this, there's only so far that pointless-struggle-towards-inevitable-crushing-defeat will take you.  Maybe that can be fun every now and again, but it grows tiresome with repetition; it's better to take the more pulp-y elements of Lovecraft's work and run with them, in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268993/#Comment_268993" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T12:30:04+00:00" title="April 26, 2010 12:30PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Also, because of my democratization-of-play impulse, or maybe (perversely in light of the foregoing) because I've never been anything but the Keeper, maybe I place a higher value on the pleasing the audience than on great individual performances.

If I'm doing my best GMing, I'm catalyzing player contribution, helping shy players find the spotlight, reminding them about things they might reincorporate, tossing out something to give them traction when they're stuck. I'm not the entertainer. I am, though, gestalt-focused rather than individual-performance focused. That doesn't change whether I'm the player or the GM, but it might have its roots in the high GM-to-non-GM play ratio that characterized my first decade in the hobby (and the expectation that the GM would be the entertainer at that time, which I never liked). Ideally, we're all entertaining each other on a more-or-less equal basis.<br/><br/>To tie this democratization thing back into CoC... I learned the Fishing technique sometime around 1997-98 from a friend of mine with an improv background. He was running a pickup D&amp;D game one day, just a really dumb dungeon crawl, but clearly he didn't have anything prepped. We opened the first door and I asked, "what do we see?" He asked, "what DO you see?" At that moment, I achieved enlightenment - I remember nothing else from that day, so busy was I was with my complete re-evaluation of the GM role. From that day on, Fishing became a major part of my arsenal for CoC, whose narrow genre conventions are a real help. Cthulhu is full of ominous details and there's no reason that all of them have to come from the GM - everyone at the table is on the same kind of page, and so the player on my left knows what the wallpaper is like as well as I do, how a bartender might respond to a request for information, how a knot of ghouls might menace an Investigator trespassing in their tunnel. Fishing fits perfectly with my aesthetic program to kill the GM and take his stuff., and it fits great with <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269001/#Comment_269001" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T13:11:20+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  1:11PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2010 1:12PM by ccreitz.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>[...] players have a chance to go mad or go berserk in a futile but stylish effort to strike back at the ineffable.</blockquote> Hell yeah!<br/><br/>OK, it's true: If players expect to be Big Damn Heroes, maybe Cthulhu will bore them and burn them out (or maybe you can all agree to pulp it up). But if players <i>want</i> to play characters who are doomed to fail, to die horribly and go mad, then those bad outcomes are the reward. Vince wrote a really good blog post on the subject which I can't locate now, where he points out that if we can come to agree, by some mechanism, that it's cool for your character not to get what he wants, then we don't need to do anything else to resolve the conflict between yours and mine - yours loses, mine wins. CoC is that at a higher level: we agree that we're telling a story in a universe where sooner or later, the stars will come right and existence will ooze on without its infestation of humans. We, the players, welcome failure and embrace, on behalf of our characters, futility, madness, and suffering. That's why we're playing this particular game! It's like <i>Paranoia</i> that way - the madness and suffering of the characters is, after all, something we paid to see.<br/><br/>And even during my deepest obsession with CoC, I played other games, probably for just this reason. I suppose it could get to you after a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269957/#Comment_269957" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T16:42:44+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  4:42PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know how to fix the problems that people seem to have with <i>CoC</i>.

Once we all agree that SAN loss is how the game is played, and not a punishment from the GM to the players or their characters, then we all have the same goal (encounters with the inexplicable and incomprehensible) and we don't have to argue or resent or play stupid power games or anything. We can drive the PCs mad in perfect harmony and have a grand old time together.

It's a good and fine goal and it definitely gets everyone on the same page, not turtling, enjoying the experience of "losing".<br/><br/>But you know what else I saw? I don't know if there's something fundamental to ToC or if it's just a general Lovecraftian RPing thing, but when the game is about driving everyone's SAN to 0, there's suddenly no tension between the characters' normal non-sanity-blasted lives and the deep awful secrets they're inevitably going to be exposed to.

The reader often knows quite early in the story what\u2019s going to come and how it\u2019s going to end while the protagonist and the narrator (sometimes combined in one voice) play dumb and pretend everything is basically ok, <i>no need to get upset, dumdedum, let\u2019s whistle in the dark, don\u2019t think about it, don\u2019t go there, oh, I\u2019ll just take a look into that old journal while I\u2019m at it.</i>*<br/><br/>Because, you know, when the protagonist looks truth in the face, the plot has run its course and the story is over. That\u2019s one of the author\u2019s favourite tools; much of the tension comes from the clash between the readers knowledge of horrible things going on/ going to happen, and the protagonists denial of this knowledge, culminating in the devastating scene where the facts can no longer be denied and <i>oh god it\u2019s all true madness swoon horrible shrieking and a quick letter telling the story of how it all came about</i>.<br/><br/>Of course, if you hint to your players that they\u2019re just walking straight into the pit of monsters, they\u2019re not going do to the \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s another, entirely reasonable explanation for all these wet, slurping noises and the toothmarks on these bones here\u201c routine, no, they\u2019re going back to their car and break out the shotguns and the dynamite.* <br/><br/>Unless, of course, they know the rules and traditions of the genre <i>and</i> you have made it clear to them that you are sticking to them. If the players know rule 1, as formulated by Colin above, and you play your part, too, you can have a hell of a time. If you don\u2019t whack your players on the head as soon as their characters look firmly the other way (with small, anxious peeks into the dark), I have found they will gleefully ride their guys deep into the mud and blow their sanity in the big climax.<br/><br/>I haven\u2019t encouraged this kind of behaviour with rules, yet. But I just realized that, in game terms, the protagonist\u2019s denial of the horrible truth is a means of preserving his SAN score. Of course, players cannot actively engage the Horrible Thing while looking the other way. But if you use SAN points as a currency, as per Colin\u2019s and others\u2019 take, you and the players can balance things.<br/><br/>If they look away and play along, their SAN stays intact. Maybe the gain even gain something, SAN points, XP, Emergency Dice, Drama Points, whatever your system has. <br/><br/>If they want to engage the menace, they have to pay something in order to face it. Switch off the disbelieve, pay the SAN cost, get the action going. When confronted as a group with a supernatural menace, the first character forced to realize the truth is paying the heaviest cost.<br/><br/>I imagine a group of Investigators in a deserted building, confronted with a security guard coming towards them. They have been expected, obviously the guard is happy to see them, judging from his hurry. Oh my, look, he has been hurt. He\u2019s coming straight at them, in a kind of shambling way. So, what do the players do? Do they pay the SAN cost right now and blow the zombie away? Or do they wait to the last, reaping some benefits and racking up the tension with willing suspension of belief, until finally one character gets attacked or is forced to face the facts, paying the cost while the others get off lightly? (Yeah, well, not the best example. Try a trusted NPC getting posessed and displaying obvious signs of derangement, perhaps.)<br/><br/>This way, spending SAN points drives the resolution of the plot forward, while hogging SAN allows the GM to have his evil guys do evil things right under the PCs\u2019 noses. <br/><br/><br/>Footnote:<br/>* Usually, willful stupidity of this kind is swiftly punished by many traditional/gamist GMs: ignore the hints, run into danger, die. One significant way in which Coc and many of its published supplements fail the source material they claim to take so much pain to emulate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270104/#Comment_270104" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T12:34:59+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 12:34PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I'd love for there to be a way to balance/facilitate/focus on that tension: The character wants to achieve certain things in his life, even while the player wants to watch him burn to the ground.</blockquote> That would be <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> you're looking for, then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270105/#Comment_270105" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T12:48:57+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 12:48PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I'd love for there to be a way to balance/facilitate/focus on that tension: The character wants to achieve certain things in his life, even while the player wants to watch him burn to the ground.</blockquote>That would be<i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>you're looking for, then.<br/><br/>But it totally isn't. :-( See my post(s) in the other thread for my thoughts on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270116/#Comment_270116" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T13:54:04+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  1:54PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2010 1:55PM by ccreitz.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Better: the game that ToC is trying to be is the one that you're looking for.

Ping your Drive to advance the game, lose Sanity, and risk burning a Pillar (maybe making your Drive more powerful each time you hit it?).
