Phases 4 and 5 will happen on con day. Commentary is very much welcome.<br/><br/>Annabelle Lamb<br/><br/>High Concept: P.I. Savant<br/>Personal Struggle: Excellence vs. Connection<br/><br/>Aspects: P.I. Savant, Excellence vs. Connection, Smartest Girl in the Room (Excellence), Haunted by Nita's Ghost (Connection), Careless When Friends Are Endangered (Connection)<br/><br/>Skills: Investigation (Great +4), Contacts (Good +3), Scholarship (Good +3), Alertness (Fair +2), Guns (Fair +2), Intimidation (Fair +2), Athletics (Average +1), Burglary (Average +1), Resources (Average +1), Stealth (Average +1)<br/><br/>Stunts: Ear to the Ground (Contacting, p. 6), I Know Just The Guy (Contacting, p. 6), Shot on the Run (Guns, p. 3), Interrogator (Intimidation, pp. 10-11), I Know Just What Happened! (Investigation, may make Declarations per Scholarship while investigating a crime scene, gains a +1 bonus when doing so.)<br/><br/>Refresh: 5<br/><br/>Phase One: Annabelle grew up lower-middle class in one of Newark's white suburbs. Her family was working-class and devout, but Annabelle always had an inquisitive and questioning mind. She spent much of her youth taunted for her height, braininess, and lack of social graces. Aspect: Smartest Girl in the Room<br/><br/>Phase Two: As Annabelle entered high school and began college, her proud streak deepened into arrogance. At the same time, she became self-aware enough to start to realize what this was costing her and began to yearn for more human contact. She found it in her roommate, Nita Manjarrez, a carefree, tough-talking young woman with whom she eventually shared an apartment. When Nita went missing one day it devastated Annabelle. The police seemed disinterested in the case and Annabelle began a Quixotic search for the missing, presumed-dead girl. Aspect: Haunted by Nita's Ghost<br/><br/>Phase Three: Book Title: "'Belle of the Ball." When a gruesome clue is left on her desk weeks after she opens Lamb Consulting, Annabelle abandons all caution. She finds herself unable to maintain her careful, methodical ways and plunges headlong into the occult underworld of Gateway City. Deep in the city's transgressive underworld, she becomes entangled in a twisted sex cult, convinced she'll uncover the mystery behind Nita's disappearance. Aspect: Careless When Friends Are Endangered                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138010/#Comment_138010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T16:14:24+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  4:14PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2008 4:17PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ericka Trivette<br/><br/>High Concept: Wizardly Social Worker<br/><br/>Personal Struggle: Do-Gooder or Slumming Aristocrat?<br/><br/>Aspects: Wizardly Social Worker, Do-Gooder or Slumming Aristocrat?, Poor Little Rich Girl (Slumming), I Can Change the World (Do-Gooder/Slumming), Everyone Deserves Respect, Damnit! (Do-Gooder)<br/><br/>Skills: Lore (Great +4), Resources (Great +4), Empathy (Good +3), Conviction (Good +3), Discipline (Fair +2), Rapport (Fair +2), Endurance (Average +1), Scholarship (+1)<br/><br/>Stunts: Wizard Permission (-1, p. 11), Soulgaze (-1, p. 31), Wizard's Constitution (0, p. 26), The Sight (-1, p. 31), Evocation (-2, p. 38), Thaumaturgy (-2, p. 39)<br/><br/>Refresh: 1<br/><br/>ROTES (Ericka uses pseudo-French for her magic, not having learned it that well from her tutors):<br/><br/>"Trouvair Partir": Ericka can do this simple Air Evocation rote to push someone or something away from her with wind. This rote is a maneuver which places an appropriate aspect on a character or scene. It can also be used to negate an appropriate boundary. Placing an aspect on a target requires three shifts of power. Boundary-nullification is dependent upon the situation. The rote allows an automatic Discipline result of +6 without the need for a roll.<br/><br/>"Le'frapper": This is another Air Evocation rote which Ericka uses to smash down an enemy. It is an attack on a single target, and imparts an automatic Discipline result for control of +4. Each shift of power she puts into the attack inflicts one rank of physical stress upon the target if the attack is successful.<br/><br/>"Calling Hun, Ericka's Imaginary Friend": This is a Thaumaturgical Summoning rote based on Spirit. It allows Ericka to call on the services of the imaginary friend she had as a child. Hun, a being invisible to all including Ericka, loves the wizard (albeit obsessively) and does not seem to understand that Ericka is an adult now. She will perform services for Ericka per the Thaumaturgy rules, but requires prices in return attendant to her nature. <br/><br/>ITEMS:<br/><br/>Eye of Illumination (Spirit-Focus): A silver periapt bearing a large, clear, translucent blue gem that must rest over the third eye. It gives Ericka a +2 to a non-power area of spellcasting (control for Evocation, construct for Thaumaturgy). This was given to Ericka by her mother as a Trial-passing present.<br/><br/>Specializations: Evocation (Air/Control), Thaumaturgy (Summoning)<br/><br/>Phase One: Ericka was a well-off and pampered child, the youngest daughter of an old-money couple. Clayton Trivette, a Mayflower descendant and not born with the spark, wed Marcia Covington, a wizard of renown. Despite having four children prior to Ericka, and Clayton's family having a long history of wizardry, Ericka was the first child born with the ability to become a wizard, and couple's last baby. Ericka was definitely the favorite, but more was asked of her than any of her siblings. Aspect: Poor Little Rich Girl<br/><br/>Phase Two: In her teenage years, Ericka began to act out in small but significant ways. Her siblings saw her as squandering her gifts and spoiled rotten. Her tutors saw her as a bent tool that needed to be hammered into shape. Her parents fretted, unsure what to do. Ericka saw her opportunity to do something meaningful with her life by getting involved in the noblesse-oblige-inspired community service drives her family had begun. She found the work she was doing immediately gratifying and began to see enormous possibilities that her wealth and burgeoning magical ability could afford. Aspect: I Can Change the World<br/><br/>Phase Three (Book Title: "Nobility Obliges"): When Taigo Cabral, a young client at the shelter, is abducted off the streets, Ericka seeks after his tenuous trail through high and low worlds. But how can she free the boy when his captor turns out to be Eileen McGrath, a mighty wizard and former teacher who will be the deciding vote in her upcoming Trial before the White Council? Aspect: Everyone Deserves Respect, Damnit!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138032/#Comment_138032" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T17:58:50+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  5:58PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Javier Woltman<br/><br/>High Concept: White Court alt-porn Impresario<br/><br/>Personal Struggle: Indulgence or Enlightenment?<br/><br/>Aspects: White Court alt-pr0n Impresario, Indulgence or Enlightenment?, Ascension is Possible Through Love (Enlightenment), People Are Tools, Useful and Easily Broken (Indulgence/Enlightenment), The Darker the Pleasure, the Sweeter the Taste (Indulgence)<br/><br/>Skills: Rapport (Great +4), Deceit (Good +3), Empathy (Good +3), Discipline (Fair +2), Performance (Fair +2), Presence (Fair +2), Fists (Average +1), Intimidation (Average +1), Resources (Average +1), Scholarship (Average +1)<br/><br/>Stunts: White Court Vampire (-1, p. 15), Inhuman Recovery (-1, p. 43), Inhuman Strength (-2, p. 41), Inhuman Speed (-2, p. 37), Emotional Vampire (-1, p. 48), Incite Emotion (Lust, Touch, Lasting) (-2, p. 30), Feeding Dependency (all abilities) (+2, p. 49), Human Guise (-0, p. 33)<br/><br/>Phase One: Javier was born to parents he claims not to remember, raised in a commune as a young child which had extremely permissive attitudes about love and romantic relationships. This group--which had a commune in the mountainous Jersey Highlands--were eventually labeled a cult; the authorities raided and jailed all of the adults they could capture. The children---Javier among them--were entered into the foster care system. He remembered the teachings of love and enlightenment he received as a young boy and was shocked by the "real world." Aspect: Ascension is Possible Through Love<br/><br/>Phase Two: Javier eventually tired of the slow-witted people he was placed with, finding a dark and bottomless well of pleasure in his facility for manipulating people capriciously. He soon fled the foster care system and passed himself off as an art student, sitting in on classes and going through a series of affairs. In all this time, however, a small part of him told him not to consummate the relationships. He finally lost control with Blanca Burdett, a woman he was captivated with and likely could have loved, had he not lost control of his desires and killed her their first night together. Haunted by Blanca's death, discovering what he is, Javier adopts the philosophy that a fully-sexualized culture is a fully-human one, and tries to find a way to change the world through his art. Aspects: People Are Tools, Useful and Easily Broken<br/><br/>Phase Three (Book Title: "The Darker the Pleasure, the Sweeter the Taste"): Javier believes he's on the way to achieving his goal as he creates a hit alt-porn website, dedicated to depicting real love, real sex, and real bodies. But when a persuasive and mysterious financier, Charles Raith, introduces Javier to the full excesses available to a White Court vampire, can Javier stop himself from killing again?

Sydok claimed that she loved the human, but in time Kenya came to believe that no one in Faerie really understood what love was. They cared for her, they enjoyed her company, but there was something lacking. Her desire to leave perfectly coincided with the apparent purpose of her birth: to be Star-Eyes' hand in Gateway City. Aspect: Living Under Star-Eyes' Loving Glare<br/><br/>Phase Two: Let out of Faerie at twelve, Kenya had not yet taken on any of the abilities of her mothers' people, and still looked very human to casual observance. She soon found herself in the foster care system, and it was a shock; she found no love there, either. At least, she did not at first. A passionate, tough, girl hungry for approval and friendship, she soon found that her inability to tolerate bullies pushed her more and more to adopt Sydok's gifts to cope with the world around her. Aspect: Sydok's Legacy of Righteousness<br/><br/>Phase Three (Book Title: "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"): When Erasmo Androde, a mysterious man of immense power, offers to free Kenya from The Choice, she jumps at the chance. But what will she do when she discovers the dark nature of the binding pact she unwittingly struck?

Granted, most of the time he deserved the trouble he got in to, but he never saw it as fair anyway. He was a royal screwup in school, and liked it that way even if it occasionally got him into tussles. Aspect: Mouth Writes Checks Ass Can't Cash<br/><br/>Phase Two: By his teenage years, Darren was a holy terror. He missed school most of the time, instead focusing on girls and doing the most dangerous shit possible to impress his friends. It was around this time he began to learn about the other side of Gateway City. When his older brother was suddenly stricken ill and the family went into financial crisis, he decided to steal a "cure" from a self-styled shaman who lived in his building. In a darkened alley, the man--now a coyote--challenged him to a riddle contest "to receive what you seek." He won, stole the secret of skin-changing from the old man, and was saddled with a duty well beyond what he was expecting. Sure, he could do all kinds of cool shit now, and he stole the money needed for a conventional treatment, but now everything weird the city had to offer came to his doorstep. Aspect: Pay Any Cost, Bear Any Burden<br/><br/>Phase Three (Book Title: "The 10,000 Year Old Man"): It's the first day of Darren's job with All Access Cab. It's a job he needs to take care of his little boy, Hugh. Sure, mom watches him in the daytime, but ever since Selena left it's been hard. So the last thing he wants to see is a twitchy-faced guy fall out of the sky onto the hood of the car. Will he be able to set this idiot straight and get home in time for the end of Hugh's nap?

I will add any more feedback and I'll try to get some AP written up today:<br><br>This was an alpha test of the system, which is not yet complete.<br><br>This game is based on the Dresden Files book series and uses the FATE system rules. It's a modern fantasy/horror game. Each character has aspects that can be tagged for some game effect, and each aspect has a sort of emotional attribute attached to it. The attribute is one of two emotional states that the character is struggling between. For example, my character was struggling between indulgence and enlightenment.<br><br/>In our game, there were three characters: a human private detective, a sorcerous social worker, and a white court vampire adult film producer. I played the vampire. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Throughout the game, I played out the struggle by...<br/><br/>    * Sweet-talking one of my actresses into showing up for a shoot even though her child had been missing for a few days. (indulgence)<br/>    * Gathering the characters together to go looking for her son. (enlightenment - I think)<br/>    * Suggesting to a few clients (in dire straits) of my PI friend that they could earn some money by "working" for me. (definitely indulgence)<br/>    * Refusing to feed on the emotions of my friends, even though I risked considerable harm to myself by doing so. (enlightenment)<br/>    * Going into a dance club, inciting lust on the entire dance floor and feeding off the excess emotion in the room. (indulgence - I think)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall, it was pretty fun to play as an evil or amoral character. It's usually something I avoid out of fear of what playing the bad guy in a work of fiction might say about me, but I think it's therapeutic to face that fear instead of just pushing it aside.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138770/#Comment_138770" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T17:28:41+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  5:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff.

I was really excited about the characters I'd written and I wanted to see more of them used. Plus, I had no slot in the morning and nothing that looked that interesting to me. I'll talk about the first session first and write about the section session later.<br/><br/>In this session all the players were male, and they chose to play Annabelle (the mortal PI), Ericka (the wizardly social worker), and Javier (the sex vampire). Background additions (which I'll write up in detail later) indicated that Annabelle had joined the sex cult to find Nita, found evidence that she was still alive, and found herself missing the physical closeness of the cult, even though she realized it was hallow and pointless.<br/><br/>The plot focused mostly around something from Ericka's background; background additions indicated that the boy who disappeared was not recovered, and appeared to be happy with his situation. I brought the characters together by having mothers of other missing children come to them. For example, one of Javier's actresses (a woman with a happy marriage who loved her child) was unable to come to work because she was distraught over the disappearance of her son. Javier talked her into coming anyway, but she was unable to perform well and he had presold 100,000 copies of the video.<br/><br/>I'm on the super-hippy angle of the FATE GM spectrum, and feel pretty uncomfortable a) coming up with the core of the plot myself, b) arbitrarily declaring difficulties, and c) keeping secrets. I made this extremely clear to them which was helpful. Ericka's player said he had an idea for what was happening and we tinkered with it until we decided that one of the kids had found one of the spontaneous gateways that pop up all over Newark, had wandered into it into a baroque mansion, and had found a magic mirror there that let them control the wizard in Ericka's background who appeared to be the villain. The session ended prematurely (we were out of time) as they got into a gun/magic fight with the puppeted wizard, not realizing the fact.<br/><br/>Other highlights:<br/><br/>* Ericka getting into an accidental (FATE-compelled) Soulgaze with one of the mothers and learning that she was partly relieved at the loss of her son.<br/>* Javier politely propositioning Ericka and Annabelle to help assuage his hunger, and their horrified reactions.<br/>* Annabelle realizing Javier's financial straits and pressuring him to pick up the PI bill of the poor mothers.<br/>* Javier offering to defray these costs by talking the middle-aged women into appearing in his movie; in his mind this being a noble thing, since you never see the bodies of poor, middle-aged women in porn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138870/#Comment_138870" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T13:27:17+00:00" title="April  9, 2008  1:27PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is feedback from one of the players in the second session, a woman playing the werecoyote cabbie. This was particularly interesting to me because it revealed things I didn't even realize in the choices she'd made during play.<br/><br/>My personal write-up of the second session will hopefully be done tonight, if not tomorrow.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Yeah, that struggle between two emotional/philosophical states really made this game interesting and *so* fun.<br/><br/>I mentioned this a bit in Rob's LJ, but I played Darren, a were-coyote/cab driver struggling between his Duty to Teach Lessons to Fools and his Duty to Family (especially his young son).<br/><br/>The story was driven by everyone trying to find out the mystery behind an ancient statue that was suddenly connected to his son. The details aren't super-important, but we knew this connection was bad. So underlying everything, Darren was desperately trying to keep this thing from hurting his little boy. He was ready to do *anything* to sever the statue's tie or take on the burden himself. (Family) So he started by breaking into the house of the previous owner of the statue.<br/><br/>When he discovered the statue had truly creepy circumstances tied to it, and that the wife of the dead owner was this incredibly unclassy nouveau riche chick, he was also determined to teach her some nasty lessons. (Fools) It started lightly with him pissing in her potted plant, but as the strangeness unfolded, his actions became more drastic. He helped Erika fight her by smashing her face on the floor and then running her down in coyote form and digging into her supernaturally disintegrating body, sending pieces of it everywhere. Then he burned down her house, destroying the statue. (Fools/Family)<br/><br/>His crush Annabelle was involved in the investigation, and seeing her as the rock he needed for a more stable relationship, he jumped at the chance to drive her home. (Family) Then his vampire buddy touched him and his desire for Annabelle turned into a feeling of deserving. She had also been touched by the vampire, and started associating sex and violence with each other, so she was pretty aroused too. So they get into his car and he points expectantly at his dick. The end.<br/><br/>What made playing such a character so fun, I think, was the dualism. He's morally appalling on one hand, but he's also potentially redeemable. If he were either side of the spectrum, he wouldn't be nearly as interesting. I have little interest in having a character indulge in sin for it's own sake, and without consequence. But a character that struggles with it - that's cool. Had we continued the story, he'd have to pay the consequences for mistreating Annabelle. He'd also likely have to pay the consequences for burning down a building or dabbling in supernatural evil. All good stuff for a story! I think I will include stronger dualism in more of my future characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
