I'm somewhat using the Mines of Phandelver adventure so far (warning, mild spoilers ahead!), and have a relationship of love-hate with it; so now I'd like to add more interesting encounters here and there.<br/><br/>I loved how the monster manual has some really nice suggestions put together, like the Animated Object entry. It inmediatly made me wanted to put a highly ornamented room as the lobby of a dungeon (which I did) and put there an ornamental armor with a sword over a fine rug. Players knew there was something fishy but couldn't spot what, until the armor attacked the bard when he tried to remove one of its legs. They could have tried to beat it down but suddenly they were too scared (still dunno why they though it was unstoppable) and run into the next room.<br/><br/>The love-hate relationship comes from some incidents with the encounters. Five goblins almost TPKed a party of 7 at first level, while three skeletons didn't lasted one round at level 2, against only three players (and the cleric didn't had turn undead yet). A bit later three bugbears almost wiped the party, so I'm slowly learning not to trust the module blindly and level the encounter up or down by my own on the run.<br/><br/>Also, I couldn't find a good way to use the Nothic, except for some telepathy roleplaying at the beginning. I loved the lore about it anyway, but in battle it become quite dissapointing. I didn't even got to use his necrotic stare due to the range being 30ft and a poor choice of the scenary on my behalf. As a matter of fact, I realize now how a few obstacles and cover here and there may raise the level of the encounter. On a 30x30 ft. room, even standing against a corner, the Nothic could have had the advantage in that last battle. How would you have used it to make the encounter more interesting?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445215/#Comment_445215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-14T01:09:26+00:00" title="May 14, 2015  1:09AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really depends on your groups playstyle here. <br/><br/>Off the cuff<br/><br/>Nothics will have some weird knowledge that the PCs need. And possible insight in the PCs fate. If Nothics are around then there is some heavy duty magic going on in the area too. If forced into violence they strike from the shadow and then retreat. More likely to wage a slow insurgency against the PCs then a straight up fight.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445217/#Comment_445217" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-14T02:26:42+00:00" title="May 14, 2015  2:26AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar with the module (or, really, D&amp;D5), but are you sure that they intend to produce "balanced" encounters?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445220/#Comment_445220" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-14T16:12:06+00:00" title="May 14, 2015  4:12PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, there's a few tables on the GM's book to calculate encounter level, where the old challenge ratings, while still useful, are but a reference. The new system to balance encounters gives the GM a budget based on the number of players and their levels. You get to use as many monsters as you want according to that budget, considering their combined levels and amount. There are tables that give you budgets for different levels of difficulty for encounters, so you can calculate what would be an easy, medium or hard encounter for each size an level of the party.<br/><br/>I should probably use that method more regularly, though it takes time and I'd have to calculate each encounter three or four times to make variants according to the number of players that come to the session (which isn't always the same, my group is pretty irregular). Perhaps I'll just calculate it once and then scale it up or down on the run based on pure intuition.<br/><br/>Thanks akooser, taking note for future use.<br/><br/>I was planning to run the <a href="http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Deep_Rot" rel="nofollow">Deep Rot</a> dungeon at some point of the campaign. For those who don't want to click the link, it's about a computer made by a necromancer with an horde of undead organized to transmit information through a sort of binary code. I already introduced rumors about a nearby place full of undead and an old man that that collects the dead around the whole area.<br/><br/>I'm including all the details I found out there, like the troll named Norton that guards the complex that holds the necromputer, behind a wall of fire. Also introducing my own, as a huge display made with animated hands that hold cubes of different color, that are rotated according to the information relayed at them from the rest of the complex.<br/><br/>Of course, the PCs will find it completely blue and full of warning runes if they destroy too many undead on the way to the control room.<br/><br/>I have no problem with regular skeletons being too weak for the party, instead, the main challlenge would be the protection system designed by the necromancer and the dude itself, who would be quite pissed if the PCs trash the place. Otherwise he may even lend them a hand on their current quest, by astral-googling some info.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445227/#Comment_445227" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-14T22:53:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2015 10:53PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deep Rot could be really interesting if you work the right angles.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445236/#Comment_445236" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-15T07:52:33+00:00" title="May 15, 2015  7:52AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thought was gelatinous cube infused skeletons, but I don't think that is what you meant.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445239/#Comment_445239" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-15T16:37:54+00:00" title="May 15, 2015  4:37PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hahaha, yeah, I've seen that in<a href="http://www.tabletitans.com/comic/mines-of-madness-page-16" rel="nofollow"> table titans</a>, it works wonders. Hmmm, I may try it a bit.<br/><br/>Something else from the monster manual that gives me ideas, is how some monsters seem to be the consequence of some roleplaying or from defeating another monster. Like, a wizard can become a Nothic if dabbling too deep into the occult, or become a flameskull, a lich, a demi-lich, etc. I'm planning to turn an evil NPC that the players trapped inside a tomb on the jungle into a blight, of maybe it could become another kind of undead first. ^_^<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
