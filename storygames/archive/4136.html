It works pretty well. The only feature I miss is the ability for individual users to sign up for sessions and get reminder emails a day in advance, which <a href="http://www.meetup.com" rel="nofollow">Meetup.com</a> does pretty well. Meetup is pretty pricey for a group, or even a small community, which is one of the reasons why I don't use that instead. If your (registered) users visit a XOOPS/Agenda-X site frequently they would see a reminder block for events scheduled in the next two weeks on the right hand side. If you have a site, a host, and you're moderately skilled with this sort of stuff (I'm a frickin' amateur) I'd recommend it.<br><br>Other than that, I'm part of a couple of communities that use Yahoo! Groups for scheduling and it works alright. It's essentially a glorified mailing list (and can be used only as a mailing list if you want) but it has some extra features, like Calendar and file storage. The user interface kind of sucks and there are ads everywhere, but there's at least an event reminder that's sent out to everyone on the list. Better for smaller groups rather than city-wide communities with a lot going on for that reason.<br><br>EDIT: Just realized that's not what you're looking for <b>at all</b>. You want a way to figure out when everyone's available, not to remind people of an upcoming session, right? ... Drawing a blank on that one. You could do it with Meetup.com by scheduling an event every night that's not completely ruled out for you, and then see which one everyone sends an Accept to. Or you could set up a shared Google Calendar, I've heard that's supposed to work well - have people pencil in the nights that's completely out for them, and whatever space you have left is a potential game night you can schedule.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92951/#Comment_92951" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T11:29:16+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 11:29AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>EDIT: Just realized that's not what you're looking for <b>at all</b>.

It can do an AM/PM split, and tag certain people as 'VIPs' who are prioritised when proposing meeting dates.<br/><br/>From a brief look, it appears that Doodle does something similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
