Because I'm not sure I get solitaire RPGs - or rather: how they can possibly be RPGs.<br/><br/>All in good spirits of course - I want to be wiser, not be in the middle of a shouting contest.<br/><br/>I play a lot of boardgames as well, and I also enjoy good solitaire wargames. There are only a few that are really good and worth playing IMO, but I'll name them here, perhaps it might inform you why I think what I think. OK, actually I only know of three good ones: An oldie called Raid on St Nazaire, one called Pizza-Box Football and a brand-spanking new called Labyrinth - The War on Terror. Check them out on Boardgamegeek if you like - main thing they are really different games, but you can get excited playing them even if you're on your own.<br/><br/>Now, story games. I find it really difficult to see how a solitaire game can provide the most important part: shared imagined space. Tell me how it could work - do you talk to yourself fx. Do you record/log what you are saying, and is the final "outcome" - story, whatever - as important, or more important, than play itself?<br/><br/>I don't consider adventure books ("there's a troll. If you attack it go to P34, if you run go to P12) to be roleplaying, so perhaps here's the hiccup already. To me there must be some kind of communication between at least two people.<br/><br/>Or am I totally xmas bonkers?<br/><br/>Per                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305337/#Comment_305337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T07:26:29+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  7:26AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Per, I have all the same questions you do!

Hm." And then we move in the direction OF board games and card games.<br/><br/>My assumption is that stuff like <i>How to Host a Dungeon</i> is best classified as a solo activity that role-players will enjoy. Its subject matter places it very close to RPG content - heck, you can use the product of play afterwards as the basis for a campaign! <br/><br/>I agree, though - it is kind of wonky. Design concepts like clouds-and-dice make no sense here: where's the cloud? Since only one human is interacting with the thing, there can be no narrative, no description, beyond what can firmly interlock/interact with the rules. You can extrapolate from, say, <i>Monopoly</i> what's "really" going on, but your ideas therein will do nothing at all to actually affect the mechanical side of play, except insofar as you might make different decisions based on that. But any "fiction" you create around <i>Monopoly</i> is not going to interact with reward systems at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305339/#Comment_305339" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T07:31:08+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  7:31AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are quite a few supposedly group games which can in effect be solitary games played at the same time, Sorcerer and My Life with Master spring to mind, as well as my Fourpenny Touch. I'm sure there are others. There is a shared world creation but the characters often never meet in these games.<br/><br/>On the boardgame side, Tales of the Arabian Nights (Z-Man in the latest edition) is another rpg like game with often no character interaction.

Can we design monopoly so that our personal fiction will interact with its design systems?<br/><br/>Or better, Pandemic, since Monopoly isn't a solo game either. Has anyone played Arkham Horror solo yet? I just bought the game a short while back and I've been meaning to try it. It's very roleplay-y in some aspects.<br/><br/>(read "Monopoly" and "Pandemic" as random example names.)<br/><br/>But Per is fundamentally right, so so much in RPGs rests upon the shared comunication/imagined space/fiction of the players.

Role playing, per se, is about embodiment of character which can be embarrassing to do alone. <br/><br/>But playing a role is not impossible alone.

I think we can take cues from that regarding setting up adversity. Random Encounter Tables in D&amp;D are basically a variant of that. You could solo your way through the dungeon and roll for random monsters at various intervals or (fictional) triggers. Then we just have to assure the player plays "fair" against himself: here we can learn from games where only the players roll. Monsters don't roll and only have pre-set difficulties and random effects that are outside the player's power. Perhaps even "scripts" as in a videogame.<br/><br/>I'm designing something like that right now, but it's a competitive multi-player game, so it wouldn't really work solo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305347/#Comment_305347" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T07:42:26+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  7:42AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2010 7:43AM by Teataine.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            POSTVALANCHE!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Gregor,<br/>How can the game text exercise judgment?

Like, when you're a kid and you're "playing G.I. Joe" or whatever, and you decide that Snake Eyes is infiltrating the evil ninja lair, so he dresses up like an evil ninja... etc.  That kind of stuff goes beyond what you're actually doing, which is sliding a hunk of plastic across a table or twirling it in the air to "make him do somersaults."  Really, this is probably only describing one approach to solo roleplay, but basically I want players to <i>project additionally imaginary content on top of the content generated by the mechanics of the game</i>.  Whether you can make that imaginary content <i>actually matter to the outcome of play</i>, rather than simply providing additional color and immersion... that I think is a tougher challenge, and probably involves asking the player to make judgment calls based on how the fiction works in their head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305368/#Comment_305368" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T09:25:59+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  9:25AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Jonathan said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305369/#Comment_305369" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T09:27:16+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  9:27AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/>I'm really, really interested to hear of any solutions the contestants devise for this problem: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Impressive. <br/>One way to tackle the simpler version, i.e. projecting imaginary content, could be to very literally explain what is occurring "in the fiction" when a given thing happens mechanically. One weird thing about a lot of board games, card games, etc. for this purpose is that there will be these odd little permutations of the rules that don't inherently carry some sort of fictional explanation - what, exactly, is happening when I draw a card while playing Magic: the Gathering, for instance?<br/><br/>Different cards suggest different answers:<br/>Is it adding books to my collection? (Library of Leng)<br/>Is it gaining new powers? (Demonic Pact)<br/>Is it amassing wealth? (Prosperity)<br/><br/>In a game where we're trying to create a reasonably discernible fictional environment, nailing that stuff down is key. Every procedure, and permutation therein, should probably be rooted in some logical, fictional explanation, unless it's rooted in, say, how stories work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305374/#Comment_305374" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T09:46:34+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  9:46AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was trying to make the player-generated content emotionally resonant (by the manipulative low blow of setting up a "save your daughter" situation) in The Plant, but your investment in that emotional resonance has zero procedural impact on the outcome of the game.

(IMO, it's hard enough doing that in a regular multiplayer game, but that's another thing...) There's also the matter of the creativity that happens when you're throwing things back and forth with someone else, versus just noodling along by yourself. Like I said above, you can do it, but maybe it's easier to become emotionally invested in something that's a joint creation rather than something that just came out of your own imagination. I dunno.<br/><br/>I think that another one of the challenges with a solo RPG design may be one of accountability. When you're sitting around the table with other people, and you say, "okay, I'm totally jumping across that gap in the rooftops to get away from the lobsterfrogmen", and as a result you have to make a roll or draw a card or trade tokens or whatever, whether you fail or succeed, you've got the other players there to hold you to it. There's no going, "well, I didn't really want to do that, let's try something else..." to break the solidity or "reality" of the effect of your decision in the fiction. It's the difference between holding a place with your finger on the last page that you went to in the Choose Your Own Adventure book so you can go back, and having someone else tell you what happens after you make the choice. Unless it's part of the game itself (which could be possibly fun and interesting), there's no take-backs.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of creating elements in the fiction yourself, without really knowing how they'll be reincorporated later, and somehow bringing them back into the game later in a mechanically (and emotionally) interesting way. Something to think about, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305384/#Comment_305384" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T10:49:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 10:49AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't the <a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/wm002demo.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mythic GM Emulator</a> basically a method for solitaire RPing?

It reminds me, in many ways, of people forgetting to roll+harm in Apocalypse World, right?  There's a counter-incentive to do it (the best that can happen is that you just take the harm, as normal) and it isn't strongly worked into the procedures of play.  It forks off to the side, so it's easy to blow right by.  Similarly, if I'm playing a solo RPG and fail to get away from the lobsterfrogmen, I might just draw a different card and decide that first draw "didn't count," as long as the procedures make that an obvious way to cheat.<br/><br/>Like with harm, my initial intuition is that -- if you work the procedures for "failing" more tightly into the procedures for everything else, so it's not a fork off to the side -- then people won't cheat.  They may not even be ABLE to cheat that way, because failing (or some other outcome that the player is not initially excited about) literally becomes "what has to happen next."  Whereas, with harm, I was suggesting that "you have to roll+harm before you can take harm" and "it tells you what kind of harm to take" as possible ways to tie it more tightly in.  In your lobsterfrogmen example, maybe you have to follow through with the procedures to find out what happens next in the game.  Or, as in Burning Wheel, failure is also critical to make progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305388/#Comment_305388" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T10:58:24+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 10:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm glad we're talking about this. )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305391/#Comment_305391" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T11:19:39+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 11:19AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marc Majcher</cite>I think that another one of the challenges with a solo RPG design may be one of accountability. When you're sitting around the table with other people, and you say, "okay, I'm totally jumping across that gap in the rooftops to get away from the lobsterfrogmen", and as a result you have to make a roll or draw a card or trade tokens or whatever, whether you fail or succeed, you've got the other players there to hold you to it. There's no going, "well, I didn't really want to do that, let's try something else..." to break the solidity or "reality" of the effect of your decision in the fiction. It's the difference between holding a place with your finger on the last page that you went to in the Choose Your Own Adventure book so you can go back, and having someone else tell you what happens after you make the choice. Unless it's part of the game itself (which could be possibly fun and interesting), there's no take-backs.</blockquote>\nOf course this makes me think about a design that would embrace "take backs" as part of regular game play.

I find it really difficult to see how a solitaire game can provide the most important part: shared imagined space. Tell me how it could work - do you talk to yourself fx. Do you record/log what you are saying, and is the final "outcome" - story, whatever - as important, or more important, than play itself?<br/><br/>I don't consider adventure books ("there's a troll. If you attack it go to P34, if you run go to P12) to be roleplaying, so perhaps here's the hiccup already. To me there must be some kind of communication between at least two people.<br/><br/>Or am I totally xmas bonkers?<br/><br/>Per</blockquote>\nA possible side thought related to the above:<br/><br/>Is it solo if there are two particpants, but one is only semi functioning, like the author of a CYOA book? Yet not at the level of a PbP/PBeM GM?<br/><br/>I actually did a bit of experimenting with something like that for a miniatures game once. <br/><br/>In that case, I had an internet buddy on the other side of the planet. Barring one or the other of us suddenly winning the lottery, we probably wouldn't be able to get together to game. Also, time zone differences would make Skype gaming or similar tricky, and since the joy here was minis gaming, Skype gaming wouldn't really have made sense, being that it lacked the tactile aspects and miniatures appreciation mongering that goes on in that sort of gaming.<br/><br/>Anyway, what we did was this: I sent him a bunch of links to photos of my collection of stuff, then he began generating story/situation content for it. That then led to "mission play", along with some back-and-forth blue-booking type stuff in-character.<br/><br/>It was a short experiment, with mixed results.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: At a certain level, it did hit that shared imaginary space thing, especially the brainstorming going into the set-up. Kinda like an author writing a CYOA adventure set-up, but geared towards me and my interests ( and toys).<br/><br/>It was also a bit like a more trad PBEM/PBP set up, but with less hands on back-and-forth. The direction things seemed to be taking was more<br/><br/>a) Show collection<br/>b) shared situation creation<br/>c) Hand off to the "author" participant<br/>d) mutual fiction creation<br/>e) "Player" participant engages in solo play based on above<br/>f) report by "player" participant of solo play<br/>g) start back at points a-c as appropriate and continue play<br/><br/>Okay, right. So, in those particular circumstances, I'd hoped to reach a point where Player particpant was then flipping over and acting as the Author participant for the other player, or where multiple situations like this were occuring.<br/><br/>This was kinda interesting because of the constraints of the mediums involved for one thing. For another, it really broke up the normal way of doing things in a way different from either a traditional rpg set up with a GM or even a GM-Full story game.<br/><br/>Relating it back to this thread, it was also a bit different from a style of <i>Create a Game, then hand it off and let them play it solo</i> thiinking, which seems to be where this contest and thread are going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305404/#Comment_305404" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T12:03:54+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 12:03PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marc Majcher</cite><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I find myself caring about the characters and their potential outcomes without ever having played it with other people.

Those moments were when the cards I drew impacted meaningfully and compellingly on a thing I'd previously imagined and was interested in. For example, I'd imagined some kind of unhappy relationship between the "me" character and his wife. A card I drew was something like "You remember something you failed at" (I'm hazy on the details), and it was fun to have that card spark off what I'd already imagined and fill in some details of the character in a way that I cared about.<br/><br/>It was less fun when the cards didn't interact well with what I was imagining. Why does the smell of oil make me feel terrified? And now that I've come up with something, will it ever matter again?<br/><br/>So I think it's a challenging thing.  Maybe if you made clever use of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect" rel="nofollow">Forer effect</a> you could more reliably spark off things the player has imagined, but you'd have very vague and halluncinatory fiction. The alternative is to have very concrete and simple elements, and tightly constrain the player's range of choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305414/#Comment_305414" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T12:46:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 12:46PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that hit me on the bus today: solo play is essentially GM-less play, just boiled down to work for the minimum possible number of players (i.e. 1).

There's not a whole novella of paragraphs accompanied by go-to-P34-or-go-to-P12 needed to achieve that feeling of being primed for play and caring about the characters.<br/><br/>I've played The Plant and How to Host a Dungeon and taken a look at The Smoke Dream.  I don't know the degree to which their creators would advance those creations as "role-playing games," much less whether I'd hold them up as those things.<br/><br/>There're some interesting threads around about Fate/Spirit of the Century's character creation and Diaspora's cluster creation as play, as feeling even like role-playing, that might inform.<br/><br/>I will be so happy if this contest results in several lonely fun toys all of which a consensus of the community agrees are definitely *not* role-playing games.<br/><br/>At the very least I'm being sent to the basement to dig out my Dwarfstar's Barbarian Prince and play it through.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>edit: Oh!

That you can imagine being this fictional person, pretending, playing a character, a role.<br/>2. Having a setting+situation+positioning for your character that is not entirely in your control or even completely outside your control.<br/>And then...<br/>3. That the actions of your character in this setting/situation, and the events in the environment are feeding into each other in a satisfying and consistent manner and outside your direct influence (otherwise it's just daydreaming).<br/><br/>Also, I set a few hours apart for myself and played Arkham Horror solo for the first time earlier. The game controls all the adversity, yes, so that's handled, but it often feels random, stilted or nonsensical. No respect for any manner of "SIS", because there isn't one. I wasn't "playing my character" in any sense of the phrase, I was merely responding to mechanical incentives, making decisions based on resource management and abstract numbers. Everything else is inconsequential colour. In other words, a horrible RPG (but a good boardgame).<br/><br/>But I could imagine that if you removed a lot of the arbitrary "gamey" stuff, replaced the board with a simple map and drew random event cards in a different manner you could go about pretending to be your character in a independently-moving world. Which brings me to another point: how much stuff should the player know? Should he know that there's a monster in <i>that house there</i>? What's in the cabinet? Beneath the bed?

I engage in roleplaying when I communicate something to another human being in a way that allows me to interact with them. <br/><br/>If I'm just sitting and not opening my mouth, I'm just an audience to someone else's story. <br/><br/>If I'm just talking, and not listening and accepting input, then I'm just inventing a story, playing at being an author (is writing a book roleplaying?).<br/><br/>Here's where it gets interesting, though:<br/><br/>Imagine a situation like a Skype game, or, even better, a PBEM game. Not being able to see the person in front of me, I have no way of knowing that I'm playing with another live human being. If a "game" could respond to me in a way similar to the way another player does, and I cannot tell the difference, then I am truly roleplaying alone. <br/><br/>Still, to me, the conscious act of communication aimed at another human being seems inextricably linked to the definition of roleplaying (the definition in my brain, that is; yours may differ).<br/><br/>(Edited to add: the post above this one was cross-posted... but it seems like we're thinking along similar lines, especially the bit about asynchronous communication: an author quite arguably is communicating with the reader, even though there is a "delay" between the act of writing and the receipt of the ideas by the reader.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305460/#Comment_305460" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T15:04:12+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  3:04PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a more serious note, I think probably the best solo RPG would be Emily Care's own <i>Fluffy Bunnies</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305466/#Comment_305466" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T15:42:42+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  3:42PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

I don't know how much story-telling you could apply to it, but there is a small sense of this world that you are existing in and growing and changing with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/51199/epic-solitaire-notebook-adventures                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305499/#Comment_305499" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T20:09:40+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  8:09PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac,<br/><br/>  Thanks for the clarification!

Rather than the game taking the place of the other human being, the game mediates communication - acting as language of expression and transformation of ideas and story elements so that you are always communicating with yourself from a previous point in the game or toward a future point. The design difficulty then is to make this transformation powerful enough to make communicating with a past or future you more interesting than bypassing the communication (i.e. short circuiting the system in some manner), especially by making the past and future you's more interesting than the present you.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Could we get some Actual Play in here?<br/><br/><b>Describe an experience which, to you, felt like a successful instance of a solitaire RPG.</b><br/><br/>What was it like? What made it feel like a roleplaying game for you?<br/><br/>For me, it's always been the fact that another human being is imbuing some importance into something I/we have imagined that makes the game, you know, worth playing. <br/><br/>Mendel hits it on the head right here, I think:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>The design difficulty then is to make this transformation powerful enough to make communicating with a past or future you more interesting than bypassing the communication (i.e. short circuiting the system in some manner), especially by making the past and future you's more interesting than the present you.</blockquote>\nIgnoring the past/future thing (that's just one possible avenue of design) for a second, this kind of game would have to make the process of establishing a coherent fiction more interesting and more engaging than just making stuff up yourself. <br/><br/>I think I would only play a "solitaire RPG" if the process were more engaging than simply writing a story. How can such a game engage what's interesting in the story and challenge me to push against it in different and unexpected ways?<br/><br/>(Note that there may be some question of Creative Agenda/creative agenda mixed into this. Maybe it's possible to create a solitaire RPG that pushes a player's Gamist buttons, but not a Narrativist-supporting solitaire game? Maybe. I'm not sure. It's certainly harder to imagine one, for me.)<br/><br/>That said, some kind of deceptive game could exist, where you write down fictional outcomes and put them into an envelope and then send them to yourself, or something like that. Like writing letters to your future self. <br/><br/>I could see some variation on Fiasco's "Tilt", where you write down the elements before you begin, and the game randomly (or at least unexpectedly) selects moments for you to apply it to your character(s) in play. With a wide enough range of such outcomes, something interesting could result ("If you drew the Jack of Spades, you must offer the villain your [Most Valued Possession] in exchange for passage over the bridge. Will you?").<br/><br/>I used to design a lot of storytelling games (like an RPG, but without exclusive character control at any level), and sometimes I would try to "test run" the game, pretending I was three or four players, and playing through the entire game, including generating the story. It was at least somewhat interesting, but I wouldn't call it "roleplaying", nor would I ever do it purely for fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305527/#Comment_305527" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T03:26:18+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  3:26AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2010 3:27AM by GB_Steve.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've quite enjoyed playing <a href="http://echobazaar.failbettergames.com" rel="nofollow">Echo Bazaar</a> which is pretty much a solo RPG.

I found my story getting kind of implausible in places to accommodate them.  Perhaps there could be a tighter set of constraints on writing them.  My "smell of cooking fat" turned up in the wrong place, and the whole thing got a slightly ridiculous air - like a bad episode of "Criminal Minds".  Maybe something as simple as saying what the plant makes ahead of time would be useful?  I wasn't sure if that would be a fixed thing or not. Maybe it's just me, but I found it quite hard to invest in my answers to the questions.  I wrote them down, but at times it felt a bit like work.  I tried not to over-think my responses, and just go with what came to mind, but a few times that kind of came back to bite me.  The break room was kind of tricky, because I answered the first part of the question, and that made the second part of the question quite hard.  Maybe I'm just not having a very creative day. Overall I liked the tone.  The industrial machinery was a nice backdrop to the story.  I'm not sure what a spin-block is though. Definitely an interesting experience."<br/><br/>"I liked it.  It is a good inspiration for creating a story.  It was easy to prepare and the instructions were straight forward.  Though I had to read the 'How Plant Cards Work' part twice.  The detail cards section was clear.  These worked well and in a sense give a glimpse to how the story could go.  I liked the part about drawing the map as you go.  That was helpful.  It was not that clear how the game ends or that you continue until the last card.  This was especially confusing when I got to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2319&amp;Mode=like">#19</a> for some reason.  The other room I had trouble with was <a href="/forums/search?Search=%239&amp;Mode=like">#9</a>.  True purpose?  I was confused by this.  True purpose for being at the plant?  True purpose in the character's life?  I know we are probably left to make that decision ourselves but I was dumbfounded by this. But I really liked the open ended questions as a driver for the story.  That was very nice and generated a lot of content that is pretty neat.  May I post it on my blog with reference and link to the game at some point?  All in all it was a fun and entertaining game.  I was itching for a solo game and this hit that spot."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad" title="Mr Toad"><img alt="Mr Toad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad">Mr Toad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305537/#Comment_305537" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T06:39:56+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  6:39AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2010 6:41AM by Mr Toad.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quote = Paul T, "I would try to "test run" the game."<br/>\n<br/>\nYep me too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first got hold of Don't Rest Your Head I did just this and had a good 2 hours of fun and enlightenment with it.

Most of our excellent RPG theory was designed by examining multi-player play. It contains many assumptions that look like requirements but aren\u2019t. With solo design you can simply ignore elements that were previously indispensible. I think the way to go is to start from the phenomenon of daydreaming, as Jonathan suggested, and then work towards "daydreaming with rules."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>One way to tackle the simpler version, i.e. projecting imaginary content, could be to very literally explain what is occurring "in the fiction" when a given thing happens mechanically. One weird thing about a lot of board games, card games, etc. for this purpose is that there will be these odd little permutations of the rules that don't inherently carry some sort of fictional explanation - what, exactly, is happening when I draw a card while playing Magic: the Gathering, for instance?<br><br>Different cards suggest different answers:<br>Is it adding books to my collection? (Library of Leng)<br>Is it gaining new powers? (Demonic Pact)<br>Is it amassing wealth? (Prosperity)<br><br>In a game where we're trying to create a reasonably discernible fictional environment, nailing that stuff down is key. Every procedure, and permutation therein, should probably be rooted in some logical, fictional explanation, unless it's rooted in, say, how stories work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI don't want to erase Zac's insight here. Literally defining what it fictionally means to draw a card is a pretty powerful mechanic. <br><br>However, I also want to point out that NOT defining what it means is equally powerful. The human mind craves narrative meaning, and can project it on purely mechanical processes. By not telling you what it means to draw a card, it invites you to create a narrative around it. This is why playing Magic can feel very narrative at times, even though the game largely avoids talking about it. Race for the Galaxy has a similar effect. Android is another interesting case. Each player plays a highly structured narrative, however everyone is so busy playing that narrative, they often have no idea what anyone else's narrative looks like. The narrative aspect is very nearly solo.<br><br>Transmitting and coming to agreement on the fictional content of an RPG is a huge part of what a successful game typically needs to do. In a solo game, this is no longer a requirement because there\u2019s no one I need to transmit that fictional content to, or receive it from. I think Solo rules are much more about helping me to clarify and develop my own fictional picture of the situation in a way that is fun.<br><br/>The solo design challenge is super awesome. I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with!<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and I am totally neutral on whether or not How to Host a Dungeon is an RPG, but it is a story game, because the rules tell you to write down what happens as a historical record.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305618/#Comment_305618" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T16:01:25+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  4:01PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made up a solitaire game, once.

So I got bored, and imagined a hypothetical scenario: I'm playing an RPG, but the GM has been, for reasons complicated to get into, put in a giant black box. They can see and hear me and what I do, but only communicate via "yes" and "no". So I've got to drag the situation out of them with yes/no questions, and the reactions of NPCs or the environment, and so forth.<br/><br/>The "black box" was of course the nearby roulette wheel and its steady stream of black/red and even/odd. The technique... wasn't perfect, largely due to the lag between "answers", but if you really do buy into the scenario and restrict yourself from asking unreasonable questions like "Does gold rain down from the skies allowing me to purchase that fancy mansion I'm after?" it can work surprisingly well.<br/><br/>One fun aspect of the technique is that, while it works "freeform" with your yes/no questions determining the results of your uncertain actions, it can actually also work well with existing game systems, too. "Okay, I'm going to try to pick the lock. Is this an average lock, obstacle of about 3?" NO. "More difficult than average?" YES. "Ob 4?" NO. "5?" NO. "6?" YES. "Damn, 6! Is it higher difficulty because... maybe I hear some guards coming, and so I have to work quickly?" YES. "Okay, rolling it!"<br/><br/>What works about it, I think is that most of the time you'll get a yes on the first or second thing you come up with, but every now and again you'll get a string of "no"s that force you think a bit outside the box. And things get pretty interesting if you remember to occasionally ask narrowing-down questions instead of serial-guessing questions, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnfiore" title="johnfiore"><img alt="johnfiore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnfiore">johnfiore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305731/#Comment_305731" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T11:15:54+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 11:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a well-timed thread for me to see. I've pitched in other forums a "Solo Gaming Appreciation Day/Month" idea (inspired solely by the 1's in dates like 1/1/11 and 11/11/11) for wargames and RPGs. So, it's good for me to see viewpoints that question the very nature of solo play.<br/><br/>I knew that when the publisher of the Mythic GME eventually released my game <i>World vs. Hero</i>, the Mythic fans would want a solo version of the 2-player WvH game. So, I designed and tested one and had it ready to post online when the book was put on sale.<br/><br/>I've written and posted two different actual play reports of solo WvH. Both were a lot of fun for me to play and write!<br/><br/>Were these games solo <i>storytelling </i>experiences? I believe so, and the use of the Mythic GME with the design of WvH <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> kept me guessing what would happen next.<br/><br/>Were these games solo <i>RPG </i>experiences? I don't think so, especially since I don't really consider WvH a RPG.<br/><br/>Is there such a thing as a solo RPG? Maybe.<br/><br/>Whatever one may call solo gaming experiences, I've come to realize there are a lot of people interested in them. On the blog of my <i>two-player</i> game, the "solo" tag has been searched more than any other. Hard for me to ignore.<br/><br/>If interested...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.worldvshero.com/2010/07/solo-wvh-part-2-playing-solo.html" rel="nofollow">World vs. Hero, Solo Variant using Mythic</a><br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=531293" rel="nofollow">Actual Play originally serialized on RPGNet with comments: Star Frontiers - Hell on Hard Star 9</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/36429567/Hell-on-Hard-Star-9" rel="nofollow">Actual Play on Scribd: Star Frontiers - Hell on Hard Star 9</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/35413099/A-Tale-of-Sprites-and-Goblins" rel="nofollow">Actual Play on Scribd: Dark Fate - A Tale of Sprites and Goblins</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305757/#Comment_305757" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T12:30:06+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 12:30PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, this thread just gets better and better.

I can imagine anything I want, so what?<br/>We don't absolutely need two or more people to imagine the same thing however. It helps and it's where a big chunk of the fun can be, but it's not mandatory.<br/>We do need a dialogue, an exchange. We need something extraneous to the player that feeds into his imaginary space, moving things around. This dialogue can be carried out between the player and the rules/designer/game text. System, right. System as in:<br/>A. how do participants (in this case participant) agree on what's happening in the imagined space. Do I unlock the chest or not? Do I kill the dragon or not? Agreeing with myself is boring, I need someone to agree with me, in this case: the rules (designer, whatever).<br/><br/>B. system as the thing that "sustains the in-game conflict of interest, in face of the overwhelming unity of interest of the player[s]". I know what I want to happen. I need something outside myself that creates the tension, the conflict, establish a dialogue with someone, some-thing, that injects "unwelcome" elements into my imaginary space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305961/#Comment_305961" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T08:21:42+00:00" title="December 26, 2010  8:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I find most compelling about story games/rpgs is exactly that fertile (and hugely interesting) ground of shared imagination.

To put it briefly: I do not believe there is such a thing as a truly <i>shared</i> imagined space. I believe the <i>fictions</i> we create in one single game-session is as multiple, and different, as there are players (including the GM). I believe the sharing is part of the <i>interaction</i>, not the fiction. The interactive praxis is a shared effort.<br/><br/>This relates to my idea of how a role-playing game goes from<br/>- the <b>vision</b> of the game-designer<br/>- through the <b>interaction</b> of the game-group (player-player interaction and player-character interaction)<br/>- and on to produce the individual, and mainly internally imagined, <b>fiction</b> of each participating player.<br/><br/>Simply put: <b>vision -&gt; interaction -&gt; fiction</b>.<br/><br/>You may argue that the fictions produced by one game-group will be related, but not that they are the same. These fictions are only "shared" in a very vague sense of the word.<br/><br/>The thing is that within this simple theoretical system, any role-playing game, including solo-rpgs, may be easily understood and analyzed as part of the rpg-family. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305973/#Comment_305973" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T11:07:25+00:00" title="December 26, 2010 11:07AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, before we bury ourselves in too much mumbo-jumbo, let's not talk about "Shared Imagined Space" - it seems the term itself creates so much noise than it blocks out what I'm trying to get across.

The King knows full well that when he dies Scythia will be split by warring factions.  So he decides it is better to pick his successor now, but to do so by clearly eliminating any contenders. The King sets a task for his three sons.  They are to raid south of Scythia, each with an army of equal size but chosen by them.

Call it a solo RPG AP.<br/><br/>I am a senior medical student. Roleplaying games are core to medical education. Every doctor who graduates from medical school and plans to practice in the US will have roleplayed to some degree. In order to get a spot in a residency in the US you must pass the US Medical Licencing Exams Step 2 Clinical Skills Test. Big name for an elaborate and expensive LARP. Medical students in their 4th year of medical school will converge on a handfull of cities and "pretend to be doctors treating patients". There are rules that I won't get into here, but the gist is that they set up a faux clinic, and you rotate to 12 different patient rooms. Each room has a paid professional actor that you interact with, diagnose, counsel, and then write orders and a clinic note for. There are certain actions that you just pretend to do because of danger and discomfort, such as rectal exams and female pelvic and breast exams. But it is all pretend. No one is sick. And you pass if you play well enough.<br/><br/>This is not the only example of roleplay in medical school. Subjects that are difficult to talk about, that make people uncomfortable thinking about, or are just outside of the experiences of most students, we role play them. It sets up a safe place to practice, it allows for an audience and feedback, and it decreases anxiety of students considerably. Subjects such as sex, drugs, drinking, money, homosexuality, religion, cross cultural medicine, and end of life care are some but not all of the areas that medical students role play pretty extensively prior to ever interacting with a patient. They are considered invaluable to medical education, and most people would say that a medical school that doesn't engage in these activities is not worth going to. Your education will suffer.<br/><br/>To give you an idea about how these role playing sessions are actually games and not just free form role playing, I will relate my most recent session. It was during my palliative care rotation last June. Palliative care is the branch of medicine that deals with helping patients make decisions in situations where there are really no good options. The most difficult aspects of this class are that you have to help patients make decisions about care when there is no option that is curative, and the other options have significant negative side effects. Most patients are going to die. Soon. There is a ton of loss that you have to deal with. The stories and relationships are amazing. It is uncomfortable even for people who are good at it.<br/><br/>So here is the game. We were lead through a guided experience. We were instructed to create these cards that each had one thing of significant value to us, each within one of 5 spheres: things we possess, relationships, activities we love, objects in nature of significant meaning to us, and goals that we have for our lives. This gave us each a deck of 20 cards with all the most important things to each of us. There was considerable room for interpretation of the meaning of each sphere, and my 4 possessions turned out to be qualities, while my friend's were all objects. We were then told to imagine that we were the character in the following fiction, and the more we immersed ourselves in it the more we would gain from it. The "GM" then read a piece from our perspective that related finding a lump in our armpit, relating it to the doctor, biopsy of the lump, the wait for initial diagnosis, the actual diagnosis of cancer, the treatment, the relapse, the further treatment, the non-response to treatment, the slow decline, and eventual death. Throughout this reading, the "GM" would stop the reading and we were asked to lose a couple of cards at each dramatic moment. Some losses were chosen, some were randomly chosen by a partner. There was one episode of recovery of cards. It was amazingly difficult losing each thing that was important to you. Eventually, you were left, contemplating the very end of your life, left with nothing as you left this world. All 12 of the participants in this exercise were left crying, with a significant sense of loss, and a new understanding. There is no way to really relate the feelings that I got from this exercise, but the exercise reliably created the same general experience and feelings in all participants.<br/><br/>The understanding gained was that each of us had different things on our cards. Each thing was really important to the owner of the card, but there were some that were more important than others. My experience of taking a friend's cards left me with the thought that I would have liked to be able to ask her what cards she wanted me to take. I devastated her because I took the relationship that was most important to her and the place that meant the most to her. She cried when I did it. To be able to avoid taking those would have been the most humane thing possible at that moment. In real life, we each have imaginary cards, each person has different cards, and through my actions, I will end up taking cards away from my patients. Therapies always have both positive and negative consequences. I will now always ask which cards they value most. My patients deserve that.<br/><br/>In this exercise, I learned a great deal about my own values, my mortality, but for my practice, I have gained an empathy that it would have taken terrible mistakes to learn without the game. The cost would have been great for my patients, but also for my psyche. I do not need to make those mistakes now.<br/><br/>To return to the topic at hand, the fact that this was done as a group added some to the experience, but it could have easily been done solo. It was a highly immersive simmulative narrative generator, with input about things of highest value to the participant added to the narrative by the participant, and an interesting game element created with just a very simple mechanic. Even in a group setting, the game took place almost exclusively in the heads of each participant. There was an Imagined Space, but I cannot say that it was really Shared. The narrative related by the "GM" could easily have been read solo. The random selection of a card by a partner could have also been done solo. The effect would not have been identical, and participants would be denied the role of a health care provider in that instance, but the other half of the experience would have been retained. There was a bond created between the participants, but this could have been created if the experience took place in different locations and asynchronously. The value of the experience could have almost completely been reatained by a solo participant who took it just as serious as those of us who experienced it in a group.<br/><br/>In essence, it had what I consider to be the essentials of an RPG. A narrative that can be interacted with and allows significant contribution by the participant, wrapped in a set of game mechanics that keeps tension in the narrative, and allows the the immersive exploration of role and situation. Each person left with an entirely different and complete narrative, even if they were all highly related. The fact that it could have easily been done as a solo RPG makes me think that it is not only possible, but my experience of it makes me feel like it could be very meaningful to people when it is perfected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306011/#Comment_306011" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T23:43:45+00:00" title="December 26, 2010 11:43PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, but I'd have to say that this "AP" is very far removed from a solo RPG....simply by virtue of the fact that interaction with other participants occurs.<br/><br/>It's more like a multi-GM multi-player experience, where each actor portraying the symptoms of a specific patient is acting as a quasi-GM for their one-on-one scene/session with a given player. Then in a round robin manner, your single-player/single-GM experience moves on to the next scene/GM.<br/><br/>I thought that what we were aiming for here was an experience that approximates roleplaying, or even embodies the essence of roleplaying, without requiring external participants at all.<br/><br/>I see where the last part of the post is heading back toward solo play, but the AP at the beginning of the post just doesn't seem to support this play style.<br/><br/>It's basically like getting the game Clue (or Cluedo) then trying to simply guess who the killer was, what the murder weapon was and where the murder was committed. There's no real mechanisms to stop you from just guessing every possible combination....<br/><br/>...but in essence it's the development of those mechanisms that might be a starting point for solo RPG play. How does your character resolve the clues? Why do they resolve them in that way? What does this tell us about the character?<br/><br/>I've been pondering this for a while, but it really hasn't crystallised any answers in my mind. Maybe my preconceived notions are blocking me from seeing how this last post is useful toward solo play. I'll think about it further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306018/#Comment_306018" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T02:30:29+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  2:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>To me this is a term with inherent weaknesses. To put it briefly: I do not believe there is such a thing as a truly<i>shared</i>imagined space. I believe the<i>fictions</i>we create in one single game-session is as multiple, and different, as there are players (including the GM). I believe the sharing is part of the<i>interaction</i>, not the fiction. The interactive praxis is a shared effort.</blockquote>\nShall we call it "Shared Understanding of What's Going On" instead? Because when I say SIS, that's what I mean. <br/><br/>"We're on a boat." is SIS. If a player wants to jump overboard and suddenly the GM (or any player really) says "Oh but you shouldn't! There's a huge storm raging around the ship! And sharks!" the storm and the sharks weren't part of the SIS. Now they are (if we agree to that player's contribution). We're now all imagining the ship in a storm with sharks, the details differ of course but we're all imagining "the same thing" (not the <i>identical</i> thing obviously, but same). \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>OK -- when I play boardgames, I tend to "roleplay". When I play Diplomacy I take on the persona of the leader of the power I'm playing. Same thing in Civilization or Empires in Arms. And Junta!. I sometimes talk in character, heck I even make decisions in character even though they are not objectively the best. Am I playing a roleplaying game? Obviously not. Am I roleplaying?</blockquote>\nHere's where I think the line between a roleplaying game and a not-roleplaying game is: does the game respond to your role-playing? Is there an obvious, supported feedback circle between your role-appropriate decisions and the other bits of the game?<br/><br/>So yeah, you're most probably not playing a roleplaying game. Are you roleplaying? I think you are (just not in a fulfilling way, because it's a bit like having a conversation with a wall), but opinions will vary. <br/><br/>I do that too in boardgames sometimes, but I always find it's more satisfying to not do it. Our group had/has the tendency to roleplay in Twilight Imperium. Our games would drag for 9+ hours because we were doing galactic diplomacy, trade, and technological advancement, "roleplaying" our civilisations. Now we learned to shoot for the Victory Points (which is the actual point of the game) and our play time has halved and games are more satisfying.<br/><br/>We started playing HeroQuest this year, as a sort of nostalgia trip. When we started, I tried to approach it as D&amp;D, I was miserable. I thought it was the worst game ever. Then I started treating it like a boardgame and play on an abstract level, to win (not trying to play a character in a situation) and the game was suddenly very fun (if still a little wonky mechanically).<br/><br/>Our group has been playing a lot of Arkham Horor lately, too. I found that we resorted to "roleplaying" ("what's going on, fictionally" and "characters in a situation") to rationalize things when the rules were unclear. We would try to figure out what's going on fictionally at that moment and then make a judgement call. I wouldn't call it roleplaying though, because we weren't making character decisions based on "what's going on" but based on the abstract mechanical stuff. Likewise, the game wouldn't respond, support or change in any way if we actually did roleplay stuff, like if my Private Dick started to hit on the hot Psychologist. No feedback circle.<br/><br/>In other words, role-playing is playing (pawn, actor or director stance) a character in a situation. A roleplaying game is when that activity is suggested, supported, rewarded by the system - it's meaningful. When we're doing it because or with the mechanics, not in spite of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306020/#Comment_306020" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T03:34:10+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  3:34AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lee, that's a lovely explanation, especially the one about the cards.

There was the USMLE Step 2 CS roleplaying-within-an-exam type LARP. That was decidedly not a solo RPG, and was used to give context to RPing in med school. The real point of the post was the second example, the end-of-life guided-experience-with-game-mechanics example. This was effectively a solo RPG in the context of a group setting.<br/><br/>This experience changed the way I see RPGs. I have been obsessed with capturing that sort of experience in an RPG ever since. It effectively was an RPG that took punchy and character-pertinent cues and embedded them in some simple game mechanics (similar to Aspects), combined them with some simple fictional context generating cues, and strung them together and recombined them into a coherent narrative. All the while, the game obeyed all of Vincent Baker's Clouds and Arrows advice about connecting the fiction to the mechanics. It was extremely cool, and was perhapse the most well designed RPG I have seen, and the author didn't even intend to write an RPG.<br/><br/>I have been thinking about creating gravitas in the fiction of an RPG for some time now. Utilizing things of value to the participants in the real world really made this experience have meaning. The fact that I eventually had to choose between my relationship with my father and playing with my daughter really made the idea of loss of everything come home to me. I have been designing a game about the kidnaping of a child, with participants using a real world relationship with a child to model the in game relationship, to the point of using real world experiences/objects/names/etc as game cues. This was supposed to connect the fiction to the mechanics, and create a very emotion laden game. From this thread, I think I need to check out The Plant. I will check back in here later to see where this thread goes.<br/><br/>Thanks for starting this thread and thanks to those who have started the Solo RPG Challenge. I think that there is quite a bit of ground to be covered, and some very interesting insights to be gained.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306049/#Comment_306049" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T09:37:30+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  9:37AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I'm finding it fascinating how much of this thread is concentrating on recreating the Character-Player part of RPGs/SGs as difficult and central to the RPG experience, as opposed to the classically GM part of the RPG experience.</blockquote>\nCan you go into this more?<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306051/#Comment_306051" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T09:58:33+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  9:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ara:<br/>I'll try, but I'm a little fuzzy headed from my holiday work schedule, so forgive me if it isn't entirely coherent.<br/><br/>Okay, to me, How to Host a Dungeon is a very GM-centered Solo RPG Activity/Game.<br/><br/>A lot of GM fun is generally preperatory, or during game, about finding connections between very different things, then building on them. It isn't as much, at least for me, about character building, or even world development exactly.<br/><br/>It's more about creating a clock-workk situation and setting, then introducing random developments and seeing what happens.<br/><br/>With a traditional GM set up, for me, that random element is 90% player interaction, and about 10% system function ( generally related directly to player actions).<br/><br/>Anyway, I guess I'd just focus more on that end when/if, I'm designing a solo game. In the past, when I've made up solo minis gaming rules, that tended to be my focus. Not trying to challenge myself in terms of winning with one side or the other, but rather simply challenging myself by throwing in some kind of random input/random changes of focus to force me to think of how that fit with other stuff at play, including precedents of earlier random stuff.<br/><br/>In any case, all of that seems to be in a largely different direction from the emphasis I see in this thread, which seems more focussed on how a character-player can get the goodness of gaming that they're used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306054/#Comment_306054" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T10:46:50+00:00" title="December 27, 2010 10:46AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite><br/>In any case, all of that seems to be in a largely different direction from the emphasis I see in this thread, which seems more focussed on how a character-player can get the goodness of gaming that they're used to.</cite></blockquote>\nI'm not getting that from the thread - at all.<br/><br/>I might add that I don't consider the split between player and GM a split at all.

With a randomizer for deciding which cards you lose (when your partner was to have chosen them) and a written version (or audio file) of what the Guide was saying, you've got something that could do a lot of good... i mean, it clearly already DOES a lot of good. I specifically meant that it could fit into the "enlighten-tertainment" category of media, which i just made up, and give that experience to people who may never need it in their professional lives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13518/solitaire-say-what" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13518/solitaire-say-what" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13518/solitaire-say-what/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13518%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13518%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
