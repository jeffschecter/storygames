The overall idea is a blogger/developer network limited to a core group of set people. The hope would be that with only a core small group of people we could develop more of back and forth cross promotion/discussion. <br/>My idea would be pretty simply that a set group of people who design games and bog would set up feeds of one another\u2019s blogs, in a side bar or the main feed, and collaborate on some side blog carnival style things. It would be assumed that the group would act as a great place for internal accountability check ins as well as group projects. It might also be possible to joint run booths, co-create merchandise or what ever else people within the League of Extraordinary Designers. <br/>So I am basically wondering:\n<ul>\n<li>What successful set up like this do you think are the best examples of what to do?</li>\n<li>How about what not to do?</li>\n<li>Who would you like to see together in such a League of Extraordinary?</li>\n<li>What would turn you off to following such a group of people?</li>\n<li>Is this the worst idea you have ever heard?+!</li>\n</ul>\nOn the flip side if you happen to be interested in possibly joining forces with me I am open to a whisper. I would like to team up with designers who can at least post 1 blog post on their own blog a week.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297404/#Comment_297404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T11:39:55+00:00" title="October 19, 2010 11:39AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to see a team of designers working on the same game, but each designer bring a different skillset to the table.

I would say the real drive would be to be able to help cross promote each other so being able to post at least 1 small post a week would probably be needed. I think designing games would probably not be a must; but since it is the point you would probably want to be a pretty active blogger to make up the difference. Even if the extent of your designing is fandom, and solely involves hacking up nifty things that would probably be enough. <br/><br/>As far as working together on a game: I see this as one of the strengths of being a tight knit group. We would all have our little projects but getting to mix paint and see what emerges with everyone\u2019s effort would be great. It also would help to act as a stronger base from which to cross promote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297509/#Comment_297509" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T16:48:33+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  4:48PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some concern regarding working with people that click together has come up and I wanted to generally address it.

sort of headquarters. I have 2 blank domains kicking around, odds-are.com and lefayindustries.com, and would be welcome to other ideas.  For the most part I'm interested in something similar to collective endeavor but with more of an introverted focus. I would not be interested in a completely open but highly limited number of core people. While what I understand about collective endeavor is they want to help others publish, I would be interested in helping each other publish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
