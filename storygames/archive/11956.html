Get your drafts together, figure out how to present them according to the minimum (or better) standards, and come discuss in a focused, supportive environment!</p>\n<p>The doors will be open for a couple of weeks, or until it looks like everyone's gotten everything they need, then I'll shut the door.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of people clamoring to get in, so I'm opening the doors immediately, rather than giving a deadline, so that means you have less time than usual to get your stuff together. Sorry about that!</p>\n<p>I'm also doing an experiment: there's someone with a game design <em>idea</em> that they need to work out. I'll be moderating very carefully to help get this project on track as efficiently as possible. I don't in general like talking about <em>ideas</em>, but if this works well, I might have figured out some good policy on the matter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
