Maybe you can help me?<br/><br/>In some threads some of you use bracketed numbers like [1] or [2]\u2026 What do they mean?<br/><br/>Also, I noticed many of you do not use the nickname / account name, but rather the real first name (that is on member's account info and that appears in the tooltip you get when you point your mouse on a poster's name). I find it troubling because when I read a discussion, somebody responds to Ralph (eg) or Mickey and I don't see any Ralph or Mickey, and I have to point on each name before I find that GeekGirlRule is Mickey and Valamir is Ralph. (It is a bit confusing, but not too much troublesome.) Is it the rule around here and should I do the same if I want to be courteous? Or is it because most of you know each other from other venues (other forums, real life meeting, \u2026) and it would be inappropriate for me to do so?<br/><br/>TIA,<br/><br/>Ajax                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143037/#Comment_143037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T08:16:23+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  8:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of it evolved from the Forge, where introducing yourself involves your real name.

I realized it was in the March and April threads (it was just "developed" recently), but not in the April thread, so I added it to Judd's first post here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6411" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6411</a><br/><br/>Here's the rule:<br/><br/>"Feel free to respond here in-thread to another link posted.<br/>- If you're looking to start a conversation, perhaps take your comment and create a new thread with it in the Stuff to Watch category.<br/>- Otherwise, to prevent too many comments in the thread, number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. Three posts ([3]) is the limit: The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread, to carry the discussion over there further."<br/><br/>So what is the "rule" for?<br/><br/>Basically, the Stuff To Watch is a great series of threads: Every month, as little news articles, or clips, or data bits, or one-line promos happen, they're a way to collect those things in sort of a "feed-like" bloggy manner. It's stuff that we want to share with other gamers here, but it's probably too small of news to discuss it in its own special thread.<br/><br/>However, some folks noted that some of these "stuff to watch" elements would spawn discussions: Some folks just want to peek in and see the Latest Hot Small Thing, and instead would have to wade through 15-20 posts of conversation that weaves in and out around those posts.<br/><br/>So this method (ONLY for the Stuff to Watch threads, it is not needed for any other kind of thread) means that you can still comment on those Stuff To Watch posts... to a limited degree. If a post deserves a "wow!" or "Hey, that also reminds me of X" or whatever, then cool, you can drop that info. Just put a [1] in your reply, or [2] if you're the second responder, etc.  [3] is the "soft limit", at that point we've found that maybe the topic is interesting enough to people to warrant its own thread. So the fourth person who wants to reply should go ahead and create a new thread on that topic, add their comments, and carry the discussion further.  <br/><br/>News on the upcoming 4th Edition D&amp;D was like that: News came in bits and bites, so people would post in the Stuff to Watch thread that month, but the news elements were interesting enough that dozens of people had something to weigh in on. That's what [1], [2], [3], ("OK, time to take it to its own thread") is all about.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/>(first names, coming up next)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143041/#Comment_143041" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T08:42:37+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  8:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Ditching anonymity helps prevent people avoid talking out of their own asses, or just posting reflexively on the internet.</blockquote>\nHa ha ha ha ha ha HA Ha hah HAHAHA ha ha ha ha ha...HA ha ah ahhahaha hahahah.

Personally, I am always mixed on anonymity. On other boards I see that the people who snap the loudest are the ones who treat others not as people but as little digital characters.  Also, no matter how hard BUTTMASTER666 wants to be taken seriously, it's a little hard to.<br/><br/>Now, there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING REQUIRING you to ditch anonymity. If you want to remain anonymous and post, that's totally 100% fine, and you're not breaking any mores. Some folks are just absolutely uncomfortable with talking to people who don't use their real name, but that's not your problem, it's theirs. So if someone says, "Hey, uh.. BUTTMASTER666? What's your first name?" you don't <b>have </b>to respond or anything.<br/><br/>Now, your account profile can be seen by other members of the forum. I have at least one friend here who goes by a pseudonym handle, and even his "First and Last name" in his user profile (that you would see if you mouse over his name) is the same as his pseudonym. Or, the above BUTTMASTER666 could use MASTER and 666 as first and last names, respectively (BUTT would be title, perhaps).<br/><br/>If you want to reply to Valamir aka Ralph Mazza, it's totally fine to reply to him as Valamir. Or Ralph. Folks who have known him online for years know that Valamir is Ralph. And people who haven't met him? Feel free to use whichever you wish. Lukzu? Luke or Lukezu is totally fine. If someone wants other people to call them something, they'll let them know.<br/><br/>So again, there's no protocol here about how to call people, not even in a "Well, it's a hidden but known rule that you should call people by their X names" or anything of the sort. And I agree, sometimes it's difficult to follow: I don't know everyone here myself, so sometimes I have to mouse-over to see which person was "Jason" that the latest poster was referring to. But in the end, it allows people to keep themselves anonymous if they want, to be open if they want, or to do the "I have a handle, but my name is known as well" thing if they want to, too. The best of all worlds, and only minor confusion. <br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143044/#Comment_143044" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T08:48:56+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  8:48AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Ha ha ha ha ha ha HA Ha hah HAHAHA ha ha ha ha ha...HA ha ah ahhahaha hahahah.

I mean he had to post that way to prove his own point, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs one of the main offenders in calling people by what I assume are their real names, I apologize to any who find it hard to read. But I just can't call Ralph "Valamir." It makes me want to snicker just thinking about it. He's Ralph. In fact when I see "Valamir" I read it as Ralph. It didn't occur to me that he had a screen name until this thread mentioned it. That is, I forgot a long time ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith others... well I want to get to know them personally. Many of them I have. I don't want to know "GeekGirlRule" I want to know the person that people call Mickey. Or whatever they really call her. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Ajax... hi. My name is Mike Holmes. We've interacted before to some extent, but I don't think we've been formally introduced. It's nice to meet you, and I look forward to your interaction here and getting to know you better. Is that your real name? <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that some people have valid concerns about having a public identity. If you are being stalked, or your religion will excommunicate you if they find out you play RPGs, or you have some other important reason for being anonymous, well I can't fault you. If the annonymity allows you to participate where you otherwise wouldn't be able to do so, then it's a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if everything else is equal to you, and you don't mind, I'd like to know the real name of the person with whom I'm having a conversation. As Ryan says, someday I'm going to meet you at a con or something, and I'd hate to have to walk up to somebody and say, "Hi Buttmaster six, six, six!" If I could even find that individual. I'm guessing that one would not put that on their nametag...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, are you really Ajax? If so, lucky you, that's a badass name. I get to be one of the multitudinous Mikes. Heck, so you're aware, I'm one of two Mike Holmesi who post online a lot (the other one uses the nickname Metallian a lot, which does help to clear things up in that case). <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143078/#Comment_143078" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T11:38:26+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 11:38AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since we're talking about names, in the interest of full disclosure Morningstar is my real surname.

To be safe, I call everyone by whatever they post as, or some abbreviation that works, even if they have a name entered on the hover over - and if their handle is also their name, like Ajax or Jason, then I'll do that, regardless of whether or not its their real name*.<br/><br/>*When I say real name, I actually mean legal name. If your handle feels real to you, and I assume it does since you pick it and can get it changed if you dislike it, then that's good enough for me. In fact, I don't use my name on all the online communities, and when I don't that's me planting a flag saying "here, you call me by this:" (like on the Forge, I'm WildElf, mostly because I don't know how to get it changed, but it's no big deal either).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143097/#Comment_143097" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T12:15:26+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 12:15PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can call me Mickey, I just did the name GeekGirlsRule because it's the name of my column.

Is that me being rude? By using data provided on their real names? <br/>\n<br/>\nThen color me rude. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually I'm somewhat of a formalist. That is, I'm very tempted when addressing Jason to call him Mr. Morningstar. I know that's fallen very out of vogue, however, and go with first names based on the current trend. But I don't like it. I should be required to get consent to call him by his first name. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids in my neighborhood started calling me "Alex's Dad." I've quickly corrected that, and now I'm "Mr. Holmes" to them. You all are my peers and can call me Mike if you like. But I'll be damned if I'm going to let kids get away with considering themselves peers of adults this way, or being disrespectful through ignorance. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of this comes from my military background. Sergeant Holmes doesn't accept people using first names unless the situation is purely social and informal up front. I cringe in business situations when I'm introduced to Debbie. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... if you consider your screen name to be your formal name, let me know, and I'll use it for that reason, no questions asked. I just find it unlikely that anyone would use "Buzz" as their formal title (no offense, Mark). There's been one exception that I can think of, where somebody clarified that they prefered this. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, if you just ask me to use your screen name, I'll do it out of respect for your wishes. But you'll forgive me if I feel a little silly doing so in most cases. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143116/#Comment_143116" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T13:15:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  1:15PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We always just called each other's parents "Mom and Dad" when I was a kid. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill do, come to think of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143122/#Comment_143122" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T13:59:41+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  1:59PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 2:03PM by buzz.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I just find it unlikely that anyone would use "Buzz" as their formal title (no offense, Mark).</blockquote>\nDon't mess with me, Holmes! I KNOW YOUR REAL NAME AND WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE!<br/><br/>"Buzz" is an actual not-from-the-intarweb nickname I've had since maybe '96. People at my then-job called me by that name for a good chunk of the 3-4 years I was there. That was also the time I got acquainted with the Web (I worked at an ISP), so "buzz" was my usual moniker online. Then, of course, my gaming group used the name since I was the second Mark to join. And *then* I started organizing ENWorld Gamedays, and ENWorlders use screen names in meatspace out of habit. I've been making a point to use people's real names of late, as a) I agree with the Forge thinking on this, and b) years were going by and I still knew some regulars only as, e.g., "Ninjacat," and that just seemed silly.<br/><br/>So, no, I don't ever introduce myself as "buzz" except to people I know via gaming fora, and even then it's as an aside to my real name. However, it's been my name to so many people for so many years that I have no problem answering to it (or using it on fora).<br/><br/>There's a group of my friends who call me a host of other nicknames, too (including "buzz"), but that's a signature of that particular group. Everyone of us has a goofy nickname.<br/><br/>But, yeah... I'd never *demand* that people call me "buzz." It just happens sometimes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143128/#Comment_143128" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T14:55:16+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  2:55PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my case, I don't use my handle because of the anonymity. I don't care much about that really. It is more of a practical habit. I started using it when I first joined a forum about 6 years ago. And everyone I met got to know me by that name. So I got used to it. Since then, I have always used it in any forum I join. I have no problem with people addressing me by name (even while sometimes it does feel a little odd to me).<br/><br/>About "formal" and "informal" talking, it is a little more complicated in Spanish. You see, we have two different "voices" for casual and formal talk. (Something similar happens in Japanese.) The thing is that before people used the formal talk for every person they met, and reserved the casual talk for close friends and family, when of a similar age (while talking to parents, uncles and the like, the formal talk was also the norm).<br/><br/>As time passed, people started reserving the formal talk for working or formal environments, and when talking to elders. It was a common practice to speak in the formal voice until the person granted you permission to use the casual one ("puedes hablarme de tu").<br/><br/>Nowadays, more and more people use the casual talk (even in working environments). Many people argue that the formal talk make them feel old. So as long as you are talking to "young" people (50 years old or younger), most people use casual.<br/><br/>Anyway... You might refer to me as Dami\xe1n, Mr. Holmes. That is ok with me. I would feel weird if anyone called me Mr. Fraustro (that is my dad!). Besides, my last name is really weird, and most people mispronounce it. And I'd rather have them telling me Dami\xe1n than misspelling my last name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143130/#Comment_143130" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T15:01:45+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  3:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Since we're talking about names, in the interest of full disclosure Morningstar is my real surname.

(I had figured the rule (what and how you count), but not the purpose.)<br><br>About names: no, Ajax isn\u2019t my \u201creal\u201d name. I think I am just being moderately prudent. The amount of info you can find on somebody with a simple google search is scaring. I am not hiding from you, from the people of this forum, but from people / organizations who just want to collect and aggregate information.<br/><br/>Think I am paranoid? Someone I knew was once blackmailed through information he posted online. Another was ripped off. And a third burglarized when he posted his mail address in a post and the dates of his vacations in another. I also was once on \u201cthe bad side\u201d when somebody tried to rip me off in an internet purchase. It took me some minutes to find who they really where, where they lived, their private phone number and mobile number. Once I told their parents that their (adult) kid had been dishonest, I was quickly reimbursed.<br/><br/>I am not hiding who I am (my personality, thoughts, experiences, \u2026) either, only how this person is officially named. I am just trying to make getting the pieces of what I post here, of what I post elsewhere and of what my real name is, a bit more difficult. If anybody here wants to know my real name, just whisper (or email), and I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019ll just ask not to use it online for calling or responding to my Ajax avatar.<br/><br/>I asked the name question because, like Tristan, I come from a culture where there is a very noticeable formal / informal switch. To me, calling someone by his screen name is like calling them by their surname in an offline context. And using their real name is like using their firstname. At work, I use the formal voice and surname of my bosses and people I don\u2019t really know, and the informal voice and firstname to address my colleagues. My bosses usually switch between informal and formal to address me, depending on the context.<br/><br/>Larps and online forums have (partly) de-weirded the experience of being called by a fictitious name in a reality context. (I was once loudly and repeatedly called one of my larp character\u2019s name while I was walking in street with two of my bosses. I did not know the guy real name either. It was weird but fun\u2026 afterwards.)<br/><br/>Thanks for the answers,<br/><br/>Ajax                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143255/#Comment_143255" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T06:33:40+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  6:33AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I wish I had an Uncle Crash. <br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143261/#Comment_143261" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T06:53:06+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  6:53AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ajax,<br/>You're welcome to call me Saint&amp;Sinner (from my blog title), S&amp;S, SS, or Scott.

I freaked out when someone guessed who I was.<br/><br/>Then an interesting thing happened. The chat was something you logged into directly, not run from your account, but your chat ID (which could be separate from your handle, in fact, you could choose a different handle each time) had to be tied to a computer account. Then they added a feature where a specific text file in your computer account could be displayed from the chat program. People put all sorts of things there, but a bunch of people put basically a resume, with their real name. Then a group of people started hosting an invitation only channel and invited people who had their real names in their text file. Then someone was making a big pot of pea soup, and invited people in the channel to dinner. The power of online social networking sparking face to face social networking was so awesome that I lost all fear of having an open identity.<br/><br/>I have never been burned by having an open identity. I've also now actually gone off to conventions and shared hotel rooms with people I only knew through online means, and every experience has been wonderful (hi James!, hi Chris!). I've even invited one to stay at my home.<br/><br/>I use ffilz as an id (not really a handle) simply because my name is sufficiently unique that I almost always get it wherever I create an account (and most of the times I don't is because I actually already have an account there, just one that for some reason I can no longer access), but I always sign my posts "Frank" and that's what I prefer to be addressed as (though if you feel a need to be formal "Mr. Filz" or "Frank Filz" is fine, "Filz" is somewhat annoying, and "ffilz" is fine of course since it's common to address people by their handle).<br/><br/>As to addressing people, like Mike, I prefer to use a real name. So if I know your name (and I know of no reason you want to hide it), or your name appears by hovering over your handle, or you sign your posts, I will address you by name. I even try to use your formal name (such as Christopher) unless I know you prefer to be called by an informal name (such as Chris). If you sign your posts, I will make an effort to use the name you sign them by (and that's a good clue that a Christopher prefers to be called Chris - oh, and I'm a Frank, not a Francis or Franklin, just plain old Frank).<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143344/#Comment_143344" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T15:09:46+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  3:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2008 3:10PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>If somebody doesn't want me to use their real name, then they prolly ought not to include it in their profile.

I happen to know that one of the posters in our broader community is fairly famous, and doesn't want that fame interfering with how people percieve their input. They want to be "just another poster." Don't ask me who they really are, I don't know. I assume that they're telling the truth, however, they don't go around blabbing that they're famous. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can think of much worse causes for anonymity, too. Like if a person has a stalker, for instance. That happens to many women, and even men, and would consititute a great reason for being annonymous. One poster I know of even claims that they are persecuted politically even outside of their home country, which seems like a sterling reason for anonymity. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have pestered one poster for their name, only briefly. That's "Accounting for Taste." And that's because I get the feeling that this individual might interact differently if they were out in the open. But they may well have a good reason for not posting in the open, so...<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is Accounting Eric? I recall there's an Eric behind one of the seemingly annonymous names...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, this isn't me pressuring anyone into using their real names. All I am saying is that, if I know it, and haven't been asked to keep it quiet, I'm going to use it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for formality, and the idea of "Buzz" being formal... Huh? If I were to approach Edwin Eugene Aldrin, AKA Buzz, I would probably address him as Dr. Aldrin. Since, you know, he has a phd, and, you know, has been to the moon. I live in awe of the man. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't feel comfortable calling somebody by their nickname, unless I gave it to them, or they've subtly invited me to use it. "Oh, everybody calls me Buzz." <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually have a nickname that a lot of people know (I've always had nicknames). I feel uncomfortable, however, when it's used by people who I'm not really close friends with. Since it was given to me by my very closest friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, there is a formal mode of address in English, just as there is in Spanish (which I speak enough of to understand what you're relating). It's just been considered archaic for quite a while now. You've heard it, though, "Thee, thou, thine." Instead of You and Your. It's more subtle in English, but it's still there in some ways. But the hippie movement put the last nail in that coffin, by making us all feel old if we use the formal. I think that's a perceptual problem, and one I got over when I was Sergeant Holmes. I think that the respect delivered by formality makes it a useful linguistic construct. But, hey, that's just me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJD, it's really ironic that you should mention not ever meeting anyone, the timinig is precious. As it happens, we got some plane tickets recently from frequent flyer miles, and we decided to go to see my wife's in-laws. They live in Marana, which you probably know is just outside of Tucson (yeah, in one of those typical retiree communities). Turns out that it's going to just be my wife and daughter, however, heading down later this month. Otherwise I was thinking that I'd look up the Phoenix gang of Alexander Cherry et al (we always fly into Phoenix and rent a car), and even look up gamers I've talked to in Tucson.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be frank, I'm not a big fan of going to see my in-laws... and I don't like Arizona, either (any place where, if the water system were to fail, we'd all be dead in a day doesn't seem comfortable to me). But I may be forced to come down there some day, and when I do, I'll be looking for any excuse to get away from the in-laws. Somewhere out of the sun, with refreshments... and a RPG to play would be optimal. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust saying. In case you're interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143473/#Comment_143473" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T07:32:45+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  7:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mike">@Mike</a>: I'm curious about this. I assumed that the "you" was supposed to be the formal way, and that in time it became the standard even for the "non formal", so that you (as in "you english speakers") ended with the same pronoun to address the second singular and the second plural person. I was mapping the fact that most languages use the second plural "you as in y'all" for formal, and the second singular "you as in you only".   I guess I was wrong <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>...btw, in italian the formal using the second plural is out of date, the fascism era changed it almost permanently to "her": you refer formally to the person in front of you with the third feminine person (even for guys). Weird, probably, to hear, but doing otherwise will make you sound servile and over-reverent (it's used sometimes with high ranking priestly figures).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143479/#Comment_143479" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T08:36:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  8:36AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may well be wrong in my assessments, Renato.

Yeah, perhaps it's the Fascists that really started us down the road to avoiding it.

I mean, there's PLENTY of other, valid reasons for viewing others as inferior; should I focus on those reasons rather than their use of some lame handle? But I can't help it--I see intelligent adults (presumably) using MrSpankyPants (sorry, MSP) as an ID and I just can't help but be dismissive of their thoughts and words. First impressions matter, folks!<br/><br/>But, yeah, I used to use an online handle... until I realized why they originally existed. As I no longer perform game copy protection cracking, nor phone phreaking, nor credit card fraud, I no longer feel that I must hide my identity. Not that one CAN do so effectively, without bouncing off a few anonymizer sites first.<br/><br/>Plus, I'm famous, now, and so I feel obliged to my fans to make myself accessible. It's a tough job, sometimes, true. But remaining anonymous out of fear for my identity is moot, these days. No one's gonna try to steal MY identity, no sir! Hell, I wish someone would... maybe they'd pay my credit card debt and get my credit score out of the low 600s. And, funnily enough, the folks who AREN'T my fans pay me as little attention (or less) than they did when I used a handle. So it's win-win all around, for me.<br/><br/>It could be for YOU, too. Go on... you can do it... be yourself. I mean, unless someone's stalking you or something... although, if someone was stalking ME, I'd LOVE for them to find me... just as I am leveling my shotgun on their face.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dominik" title="Dominik"><img alt="Dominik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dominik">Dominik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143672/#Comment_143672" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T07:57:33+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  7:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am using only my first name, because my full name, which is Dominik Schwager, is also a race car driver and I really don't want to be mixed up or him gathering any negative publicity because I said something stupid on the internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143681/#Comment_143681" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T08:35:03+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:35AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I would SO use my full name if it were the same as a famous person's.

Huh? If I were to approach Edwin Eugene Aldrin, AKA Buzz, I would probably address him as Dr. Aldrin. Since, you know, he has a phd, and, you know, has been to the moon. I live in awe of the man.<br/><br/>I don't feel comfortable calling somebody by their nickname, unless I gave it to them, or they've subtly invited me to use it. "Oh, everybody calls me Buzz."</blockquote>\nIn the case of Buzz Aldrin, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia tells me</a> that he's had that nickname since childhood and legally changed his name to Buzz in 1988. However, that doesn't mean you should just presume to call him Buzz on first meeting him, I don't mean to dispute that. <br/><br/>In the case of my Uncle Crash, he's never made that his legal name, but it is the name he uses with everyone. I don't actually know whether he had it on his business card when he was a real estate agent, but he does introduce himself as Crash and his family only ever calls him Crash. (Years ago when a couple of his kids got lost at the beach, and the lifeguards tried to coax his real name out of them, they tearfully insisted it was Crash, because they'd never heard anyone use his birth name and didn't know it.)<br/><br/>Again, I don't mean to say your attitude about addressing people by their proper name is wrong, and I don't dispute that it's unusual for people to use by preference this kind of non-name nickname with everyone, but I do believe that - particularly on the Internet - it's less unusual than you seem to think it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143855/#Comment_143855" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T01:19:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  1:19AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SO,<br/><br/>a new question: should I say we're going way off-topic here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143893/#Comment_143893" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T06:39:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  6:39AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We probably are. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a restatement of your concerns now late in the thread?
