I thought it would be helpful to develop criteria for evaluating mechanics--essentially a checklist when considering a particular mechanic for a particular game. Criteria appear in the following post. I'd love to hear some feedback on the criteria, including thoughts on nomenclature, my categorizations, and areas where I can better describe the criteria.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

It would be jarring to use poker chips in a game about the Crusades. I recently engaged in an <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6210" rel="nofollow">interesting discussion</a> on the Story-Games forums regarding the implications of playing-card mechanics, dealing with this very issue. Ideally, the mechanic reinforces the feel of the game. For example, there is a great Western rpg, Dust Devils, that uses playing cards and a poker-based mechanic--a perfect fit. That mechanic woudl also suit a game about, say, Vegas mobsters. I'd love to incorporate bullets as a tangible component in the Tokyo Rain mechanic (but see point #2). I should mention that dice-based mechanics are essentially generic--they suit most games.<br/><br/><b>2) Accessibility -</b> The mechanic must use components that are easily accessible. Unlike traditional boardgames, role-playing games generally don't come pre-packaged with the implements of play. Generally, you get a book and are expected to procure the other components independently. It helps the customer if the components are readily available. So, while I'd love to use bullets as some component of the Tokyo Rain mechanic, I can't expect the average purchaser to be able to acquire them. Some components are very easy to obtain, e.g., dice, playing cards, coins, etc. Others are more difficult, e.g., tarot cards, glass beads, metal figruines, etc.<br/><br/><b>3) Handling -</b> The mechanic must not be too "fiddly". I love that word. Apparently very common in England, in the context of a game mechanic, it refers to the complexity in play. How much handling does it require? How many components does it use? How frequently must they be used? Are they awkward to manipulate? I recently engaged in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6212" rel="nofollow">another discussion</a> on the Story-Games forums regarding coin-based mechanics. The overwhelming response is that they require too much handling. They're a pain to scoop up and flip en masse. That's a high handling factor.<br/><br/><b>4) Facility -</b> If handling represents teh physical manipulation fo the mechanical components, facility represents the ease-of-use of the mental aspects. A mechanic should not have too high a learning curve and should not be difficult to comprehend, retain, and recall in the course of play. Along the same lines, requiring references to written materials during play is sub-optimal. Simplicity is often (but not always) a good measure of facility. For example, Dungeons &amp; Dragons uses the d20 System, which can be summarized as: Roll a 20-sided, add modifiers, and compare it to a target number. While it sounds simple, there are a number of exceptions, conditions, and sub-systems that increase the complexity by an order of magnitude. Compare that to my own Passages game, which uses the same fundamental mechanic but strips out that complex overlay. I am also presently working on the Bullseye system, which strips the mechanic all the way to the bone. That effort is a specific attempt to morph d20 to a system of greater facility.<br/><br/><b>5) Results -</b> The mechanic should have the desired impact on the flow of the game. Random mechanics should yield an appropriate array of results. Using dice as an example, compare rolling a 20-sided die to three 6-sided dice. Each mechanic results in teh same average roll and roughly the same spread. However, the 20-sided die is a "flat" mechanic, where any given result is equally likely. The 6-sided dice produce bell-shaped results, weighted towards the center. Taking a game, leaving everything else the same but using one ro the other of these two options, would result in two games that play drastically differently. Even non-random mechanics create an intra-game "economy" that dictates how the game will play. If players can spend tokens to take actions, changing the number of tokens will change gameplay overall-and not just in a semantic sense.<br/><br/><b>6) Fun -</b> Games are supposed to be fun. To assist in this goal, a game's mechanics should be fun too. In some ways, this is a conglomeration of the other five criteria, but I look at it as the cliche-but-accurate "X-factor". Indeed, a mechanic can rate highly on the other critera but just miss the mark in some unidentifiable way. The fun factor is principally borne out in playtesting.<br/><br/>In evaluating any mechanic, you have to weigh the various qualities and develop an overall sense of how good a given mechanic is for a partiuclar game. For example, a mechanic that is a little fiddly, might still be the best fit because it is highly suitable and very easy to use. Or a mechanic might require lots of tables, but you are willing to overlook it because you think the results it yields are too good to pass up. So the process isn't just evaluating the mechanic by the six criteria but also how important each of those criteria.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138884/#Comment_138884" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T14:27:29+00:00" title="April  9, 2008  2:27PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All,<br/>\n  I guess I can try and synthesize the method I use:<br/>\n1) Compatibility with existing mechanics in the system<br/>\n2) Effort required by player (not just handling time, training time, etc)<br/>\n3) Complexity of design (How much work will require it to work the want I want, and describe it intuitively)<br/>\n4) Drift - Does this mechanic push you more towards or away from becoming a hack of an existing game or not?
