It is very, very hard to keep something private for long. We have personal networking sites, blogs, instant messaging, cell phones, and more. Of course, while information might want to be free, the people who create it often want it to be costly. The RIAA goes after people who illegally download songs with an almost mafia-like ferocity. The movie The Hurt Locker made very little money in DVD sales, but millions of people downloaded it illegally, so the creators tried to recoup some of their investment by tracking down and suing people who had pirated the movie. There were those ads around for a while about the evils of digital piracy (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS6ncGEyszc).<br/>\nStill, all of this has done very little to stop the spread of digital piracy. What I want to know is, how do you react to file sharing? Do you do it? If so, do you have any limitations you set for yourself? Those of you who create, whether you write games or books or music or what-have-you: how does file sharing affect what you do? Do you expect people to pirate your creations? Do you lower your prices? Raise them? Give away your stuff for free?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I don't make use of file sharing all that much. I use it when obtaining a legal copy would be extremely difficult, or extremely costly. What I consider most when downloading something illegally is: if I got this legally, would it benefit the original creator? So I have a pirated copy of Nobilis, guilt-free. Jenna K. Moran is an absolute genius. But legal copies of Nobilis are a) expensive, b) hard to find, and c) used, so none of the money goes to Jenna or Hogshead Publishing (which is out of business anyway).<br/>\nOf course, I'm not perfect. I have, on occasion, downloaded things which I could have gotten legally without too much trouble. I find it much easier to demonize corporate entities than independent publishers, so I'm much more likely to pirate from an enormous corporation than from a small independent game designer.

Personally, I see DLing material as a way to preview it but anything worth keeping is worth keeping right.  If I DL an RPG .PDF then I check it out and pretty immediately it goes on my to buy list or gets deleted.  Netflix has more or less solved the problem of video media, no need to pirate anything.  Podcasts have more or less replaced music DLs, though it helps that I more or less don't like any of the music of the last 10 years...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284160/#Comment_284160" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T12:20:54+00:00" title="August  3, 2010 12:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might be the voice no one will want to hear in this.<br/>I am totally against file-sharing that doesn't first have the blessing of the original creators. The way I see it, when people are producing something to sell, they are hoping to make money, even if just a little. It is merchandise.<br/>When others attempt to aquire that merchandise without proper compensation, it is theft, plain and simple. I don't care how anyone tries to justify it, it is morally and legally wrong. I don't know how anyone can say, with a straight face, that its okay for them to torrent a movie or song they want illegally, simply because they think it is normally too expensive.<br/>People have gotten far too hung up on getting "what they want, when they want it." If something is too expensive, they think they still have some sort of god-given right to have it anyway. If a car is too expensive for someone to buy, should they steal it then? If you don't want to shell out $20 for a dinner, should you just duck out when the waiter isn't looking?<br/><br/>When I want something, I will see what options are available from the creator/rights-holder. If they sell it in some fashion, but it is too expensive, I'll wait till they have a sale, or until I can get a copy used. If they are offering it for free, that's fine, and I think it's cool the way there is so much in the way of games that ARE free. Some of the best stuff I've seen in the last couple of years has been free (DungeonSlayers, Lady Blackbird, DungeonSquad, etc.) But if I "need" that lovely 300+ page full-color rules-book from Mega-Publisher X, and it costs $65, I'll either shell out the cash, wait for a sale, or wait for a used copy. Or I'll just not get it, because in reality, it isn't something I really "need."<br/><br/>My tirade is over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284161/#Comment_284161" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T12:23:17+00:00" title="August  3, 2010 12:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pirate all sorts of stuff.

On the other hand, if no one pays me for stuff I make, I can't afford to make it, and I have to spend my time doing other stuff.

The other is the "I want to take a look at it before I buy" philosophy.<br/><br/>The former, I don't have much respect for.  The latter, I think is overall beneficial both to creators and consumers.  I mean, I've bought dozens of CDs because I heard an MP3 that someone gave me illegally, and I've given MP3s to other people who then bought CDs because they liked them.  I've done the same with some game PDFs: there are a few gamers I've just given game PDFs to, because I know that they (being ethical people themselves) would either delete the file if they didn't care for it, or buy it if they liked it.    <br/><br/>I'm also ethically okay with getting something I already have in another format.

I see that as being very similar to using a PVR; all I'm doing is shifting my watching habits to suit my own convenience.<br/><br/>When I can, I throw money towards official versions of stuff I like; I go to concerts when I can, buy hardcopies of books I like, and so on.

The media itself should no longer be viewed as the product, but rather as a form of promotion to attract consumers towards the purchase of other products.

That is, if I'm curious about some game, but my local store doesn't have it (or I just want to give it more than a page-through), then I'll pirate it and skim it. More often than not, this leads me to buy the game. I never pirate games for the express purpose to play them but not pay for it. If I pirate a game, I either buy it or delete it. If skimming through it has made me realize I don't want to buy it, then I delete the pdf, because if I don't like the book enough to buy it, what's the point?<br/><br/>I rarely buy pdfs, and in the few cases I have, I print them out. I never print out pirated pdfs, but if I've pirated a pdf to check out the game, and subsequently buy the game, I usually keep the pdf. I suppose I wish all publishers (who sell pdfs) gave me a free pdf with the game purchase--I feel like IPR is ripping me off when they charge more than the print book for a print + pdf bundle, especially since other people just give me a free pdf with the purchase of a book. In cases where you can buy the pdf and then get the price of it as a discount to buy the book, I never pirate.<br/><br/>I suppose I justify it by saying to myself, "you wouldn't have bought the game and given the creator money if you hadn't checked out the file." Pirating the pdf, buying the book, then keeping the pdf (in cases where you don't get it free with the purchase) is probably the thing I do that I am least comfortable with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284175/#Comment_284175" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T13:34:38+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  1:34PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem is not the act of file sharing but the stigmata the industry has portrayed.

Even if the idea is worth that much (a sketchy proposition even for the very best ideas- development is an essential part of any such winning formula) misappropriating is not, and never has been, theft. Patent violation, misappropriation of trade secrets, that kind of thing, sure. Theft, no. Unless, of course, copies of the idea are removed from the possession of the owner.<br/><br/>The problem is that theft, as a legal concept, is rigorously defined. If the victim still has it afterwards- it is not theft. That's how the definition runs. In common speech we often use the word for similar transgressions, but it is an error to work backwards from that and insist that the legal term must apply to anything we casually call theft. <br/><br/>It's not just a difference of extent, either- the fact that nothing goes missing with copyright violation is a quantitative difference between it and theft.

I'm there.<br/><br/>I used to be ambivalent about the moral implications of piracy for the longest time, but I finally got convinced by the simple logic of history: the technology is here, nobody is entitled to a livelihood just because it used to be viable, and the fact that people are even discussing the matter proves that a reductio ad absurdum argument doesn't seem to work in this matter: people easily say that free distribution can't work as an universal principle because that would lead to a world of no new art and that's absurd, but obviously the matter is not clear-cut, as people are not getting convinced by the clear absurdity - to the contrary, many people, myself included, are seriously trying to figure out how to make culture industry work in a world of free distribution. I would rather not keep staring at the past and the logic of material industry when we could instead try to invent something new; it's much more credible that in the future we work around the technological fact of free distribution than that this becomes the first technology in the history of the world that is somehow effectively suppressed so that old ways of culture industry can get to continue in an artificial bubble.<br/><br/>The above logic is really more about the overall issue of free distribution, but it does come back to piracy: I can't really get bothered about people doing what comes naturally, and the fact is that piracy seems to ping as theft only to a minority, and then only once you do a lot of work to raise their awareness of the matter. The anti-piracy propaganda seems to consist mostly of distasteful lies that aren't that effective in reaching the masses, while the free distribution networks operated by piracy volunteers consistently beat the pants off of commercial solutions in most fields. We're still living a transition period, but all signs seem to me like my personal opinion about piracy has negligible weight alongside the facts of technology: we live in an universe where information can be moved freely, and any effort at trying to limit this will cost us more in terms of freedom, equality and culture than I'm willing to pay. The information network is just like atomic power in this regard, you can't put the genie back into the bottle and pretend that selling paper is some natural prerogative for us publishers. The rational answer to the matter is to accept free distribution of information as a basic fact of nature instead of debating it as a moral conundrum; just like horse carriages had no prior moral right to continue subsisting once the car was invented, traditional publishing has no moral prerogative in this matter.<br/><br/>It's true that piracy is technically a crime at the moment, especially in more restrictive jurisdictions and at larger, more efficient scales. It's a civil offense, though (excepting organizations that are given general power of attorney in prosecuting an entire field of art on the matter, such as we have here in Finland for the music industry), and I won't be suing anybody for pirating my works, even those that are published in traditional ways. Others have written a lot about why a traditional publisher shouldn't go into knots about piracy, but aside from the economic arguments, I don't feel good about haunting people for doing the natural thing: it's there, taking it doesn't hurt anybody, but it sure does enrich your own life. I'm myself mister Austerity personified, and rather likely to reproach people for lack of self-control, but I don't mind people following their base instincts when those instincts are basically positive, such as is the case when it comes to consumption of culture: if enjoying the culture industry were a flaw of personality, then we should not only unplug the Internet, but also close down the libraries, those debased pits of entertainment and knowledge. I'd rather think that anybody utilizing the Internet as their personal library is building up to whatever it is that we're going to become as a culture once information technology becomes truly omnipresent.<br/><br/>(The philosophically inclined might wish to generalize my argument to say that pickpocketing shouldn't be illegal because it cannot be effectively prevented. Insofar as preventing pickpocketing would require us to go about in public with our hands glued to our pockets, I agree - legalizing pickpockets and learning to live with the phenomenon is the smarter solution. The same goes for piracy: the technology is overwhelmingly pointing towards free and immediate distribution, so trying to moralize and legalize that fact away is just foolish and potentially disastrous.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284185/#Comment_284185" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T14:01:09+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  2:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DMGnome</cite>Of course, I'm not perfect.

What about you?</blockquote>\nI'm also not perfect, though I try to be better than the technology allows me to be.<br/><br/>I have no compunctions about downloading TV programs, for example; if they were broadcast freely and/or available on my cable subscription, it's pretty much the same as me time-shifting it.  No commercials, I guess, but the TV ratings people aren't logging what I watch anyway, so it's doubtful whether it actually means anything to anyone's bottom line if I'm not watching the commercials.  But by the same token, I don't bother downloading shows that I can see on Hulu, because I mostly like Hulu as a service and I figure that seeing THOSE commercials might count towards staving off the oft-threatened subscription fee for the site.  And sometimes I'll watch a show that's on the bubble via the network's website, in the hopes that they'll track that data and say "Oh, more people are watching that show than we thought, we should renew it."<br/><br/>Music, I'm less good about.  I'll download rare or out-of-print albums that can only be purchased from collectors at exorbitant prices, because fuck those guys, seriously.  But I'll also download things just to see if I like them, and I'm not always that good about saying "Yes, I do like this, and now I will buy it legitimately"; and if the band never comes to my town I don't even get to give them money to see them live, or buy merch from them.  And I feel shitty about that.<br/><br/>What I love are the musicians who let you listen to the full album on their website and have a link RIGHT THERE to buy and download it immediately at a good price; I always buy from them and always tell them how happy I am to be buying their music this way.  I'm hoping this becomes a more common business model: it puts more cash directly in the hands of the artists (which makes me feel virtuous and clean -- seriously, it feels <i>good</i> to pay $8 for an album and know that the musicians are getting more profit from that than they ever did from a $15 retail CD), the files are typically of better quality than the pirated stuff you can torrent, and it lets the artists know that they've got a fan out where I live, which might bring them through the next time they're on tour.<br/><br/>Movies, I don't typically touch; they're too easy to rent or check out from the library if I only want to see it once, and if I want to see it more than that, I'd rather have the real product with the packaging and bonus features and everything.  Same goes for books, compounded by the fact that PDFs are basically the worst way to read anything, ever.  RPG books or reference manuals I'd rather have in hardcopy if they're something I'm going to use seriously:  PDFs are if there's no good hardcopy option (the book is out-of-print and I'd have to pay some jerk on eBay a hundred bucks for it) or if I'm doing the equivalent of an in-store flip-through to decide whether the book's worth ordering on Amazon or wherever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284186/#Comment_284186" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T14:02:44+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  2:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 2:06PM by stupidgremlin.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite><br/>The problem is that theft, as a legal concept, is rigorously defined.

The intention of patent law is to publicize new inventions so that they are used more widely, in contrast to having all inventors working in secret because they're scared of an idea being copied.<br/><br/>Also note that holding a copyright and holding a patent are quite different things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284194/#Comment_284194" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T14:42:37+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  2:42PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 2:42PM by Queex.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>If that were the case, then there wouldn't be the whole problem with people violating patents for inventions and technology.

We have people saying it isn't theft, because there is no physical item. Yet, can we really divorce an item as "merchandise" or "property" because it is now in digital form online? I would say no. It is still technically the "property" of the copyright holder, for them to decide to distribute or not as they see fit. If they want to make it available free, that's their choice. Others cannot make that decision for them, and when they take it or distribute it without that right-holder's permission, I think that constitutes theft, as much as if you steal some beer from a store, or take someone's patented ideas to make your own product without paying them for it.<br/><br/>Yes, making things digitally available will require a major paradigm shift on the part of companies, right-holders, and the many involved industries. But until they do so, it isn't right to say "screw you, I'm taking it anyway."<br/>For those who download things just to see if they like it...well, that's probably where the paradigm shift needs to start. More ARE offering free samples, free songs, free content, etc., but again, that is THEIR choice to do so. If they start to succeed because of it, others will follow suit.<br/>But if people keep using the "want NOW, damn what you say" attitude of downloading, they aren't helping anything.<br/><br/>Both sides need to change.<br/><br/>...and that's the last I have to say about it.

As someone whose house was recently broken into twice, I can say without hesitation that it would have been much better for me if the burglars had just made copies of the things they stole, and taken them instead.<br/><br/>For the most part, it seems that in the case of the majority of illegal downloading of media, there's not a huge amount of revenue lost, as most people who download stuff wouldn't be buying it in the first place if they couldn't get it for free. I'm sure there are exceptions everywhere, and I'm also sure that people here give it much more thought than the average torrent-sucker, but for the most part, I'm guessing that's the case. Doesn't make it right, but it doesn't make it the huge disaster that the industries make it out to be.<br/><br/>As far as games go - well, if you're downloading stuff that a small or one-person publisher here is putting out for much less than they probably should be, you're just a dick.

I happen to agree to pretty much everything he said.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I think that there's a false correlation in the minds of, well, everyone between price and piracy. Media, in the modern world, is cheap. By and large*. By "cheap" I mean "most people can afford it if they want it."<br/><br/>People don't pirate shit because they can't afford it. They pirate shit because it's popular, they want it, and piracy is easy to do. If you're popular, you get pirated. If you're not popular, you don't get pirated. It's basically that simple. It does not matter what you charge.<br/><br/>F'rinstance, Houses of the Blooded is considerably more popular than Bliss Stage. I charge $10 for Bliss Stage eBooks (until recently, $13, which is fucking unheard of for a role-playing game). John charges $5 for Houses of the Blooded. Who would bet that there's more Bliss Stage than Houses on the piracy networks? Not me.<br/><br/>My approach to the issue is to simply make a direct appeal. I make it clear that I'm an individual producer, and this money matters to me. If you look at the disclaimer at the back of Maid RPG, that's a pretty good indication of my views on the subject (and a similar disclaimer is going in all my new eBooks.) For those rare few who don't have Maid, here's what it says, roughly: "So, you pirated this game. Well, play it! It only takes a couple of hours and it's fun. And when you're done, consider kicking us some money for a legit eBook copy, so we can feed poor Ewen and get him to translate more books from Japanese."<br/><br/>Does that stop piracy? No. But I don't care about pirates. I can't. They're not my customers. The point isn't to stop piracy as much as it is to convert pirate consumers into actual customers, which are the people who I do care about.<br/><br/>If any publishers have ideas for a better approach I'd like to hear it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Textbooks and academic journals excepted. These use an interesting system: they sell to captive audiences (libraries and students) at high prices and just assume a fair amount of piracy (in the form of textbook packets, etc.) is going to take place. This would be like me charging $200 for a game and just assuming that only 50 or so people would actually bother paying. It's also the business model of most office and design software. I find it compelling, but probably I couldn't get away with charging $200 for a game, so ...</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284204/#Comment_284204" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T16:28:58+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  4:28PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite><br/><br/>I want to try to ask one quick question, if you'll permit me.

Like I said in my example, it's closer to taking something from a store, as opposed to taking an individual's stereo (which would be more like hacking into their computer and deleting their iTunes software).<br/><br/>I don't know why people seem to think these things are so different, and I can see some of the comments towards what I have posted getting kind of edgy without any actual constructive discourse. I'm not going to be able to change anyone's mind about this, but they can't change my mind on it either. Maybe I'm a dinosaur in this new digital age. Maybe I'll be left behind in the dust with brick-and-mortar bookstores and video rentals. So be it. But if I make a game (or comic, or song, or whatever) that I intend to sell, it isn't up to someone else to decide its okay to download or distribute it as they please simply because there is a digital version of it somewhere online. I don't see why this is so hard for people to grasp.<br/><br/>Once again, no more from me on this thread.

It's unlikely they cancel one another out completely but it's certainly a swings and roundabouts situation.<br><br>I think that convenience is much greater factor in the prevalence of downloading than price. Through official channels you can have to contend with bespoke formats and can run into difficulty moving things from one device to another, DRM which might rob you of your purchase at some future date, DRM that prevents you from doing something you have a legal right to do in the name of also stopping you do something you shouldn't, exclusive agreements with some retailers which mean you can't get everything you might want from one place, retailers that insist on user registration for free items, extra steps in the download process to validate your purchase, the necessity of being online to use what you've purchased, and probably many more. Piracy wins hands down in the usability stakes.<br><br>I think a lot of people have been trained to be super reluctant about purchases over the internet if it's not from a huge name like amazon or itunes or woot or something- that works against smaller on-line retailers too. Illegal online channels are perceived as being lower risk.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284241/#Comment_284241" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T05:07:46+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  5:07AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>I think that convenience is much greater factor in the prevalence of downloading than price.</blockquote>\nThere's a strong completist, collector's impulse at work too.

I approach piracy through the lens of a fine artist, where if someone pirates your work 99% of the time it is so they can claim it as your own. In those instances, it IS theft, because they're stealing your reputation. Sure it's intangible, but it's a thing being stolen.<br><br>On the other hand... True story. I have an orchestral recording of the ENTIRE symphony from Final Fantasy XI. The whole thing, including vocals, the Ultros music, all of it. It's 24 minutes long, and I've never seen it anywhere else on the internet. Thing is, I downloaded it off of Napster back in the day. Ever since then, I have been trying to find the damn CD that it came off of so that I can give someone some money for the thing. It's amazing! So in cases like this, piracy kept this recording alive. It's dead and abandoned, but I found it and I love it. I'd love to make it legal, and totally will if I ever do find the CD. But for now it's enjoying creative life long past the distribution has (apparently) ended.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>There's a strong completist, collector's impulse at work too.

A lot of indie games are pretty setting-light. It's easy to see them as instruction manuals, which just doesn't have the emotional resonance of other media. It's easy to point at visual art and say stealing art is wrong, because you can easily prove that you're depriving the artist of income. Stealing music is fuzzier because of the usurious nature of the recording industry, but a lot of people would agree that not paying for any of your music at all is wrong. But roleplaying games? Well they're just instruction manuals. It's easy to say to yourself that it's only stealing if you only follow the instructions in the manual (ie, play the game).<br><br>Mind, I'm not making a judgment one way or another as to whether pirating games is wrong. I have too many conflicting thoughts and feelings on the issue.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284254/#Comment_284254" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T07:38:55+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  7:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2010 7:59AM by PeterBB.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any time people talk about a game and it looks interesting, I download and read it.

Lacuna, for instance, looks pretty interesting. I'll never buy it, though, because I can't get a copy to read. Same goes for Shock: (which i suspect I would love, if I could read it), and any number of other games that I've forgotten since I never got the chance to read them.<br><br>Sometimes there are exceptions. Really low-volume games that get great reviews will sometimes convince me to buy them unseen, but those are exceptions.

Then I'll find a way to make the hardcopy more useful or awesome, so that there's still an incentive to buy it.

It also specifies it as limited, though that has been legislated away to the point of absurdity.<br><br>"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."<br><br>If ideas and copyable works of art were really owned by their creators, and it were really theft to copy them, it would be ridiculous to limit copyright.  It ought logically to last forever.  If something is theft now, it should be theft in a few years.   But up until fairly recently, that was not the case.  Copyright isn't property.  It's a limited monopoly granted for pragmatic reasons by the government.  So copyright violation isn't "theft" except metaphorically.<br><br/>It may be the most evil thing in the world, it may be like kicking babies to death with steel toed boots, it may make the Baby Jesus cry, but it isn't theft.<br/><br/>If you disagree, argue with the Constitution, not with me.<br/><br/>Maybe it's worse than theft, as some here have suggested!

Specifically, I'm interested: would you say that the fact that you might have trouble providing the means for your art in the future is the fault of<ol><li>People being assholes and stealing from you.</li><li>Technology (scientists, really) making it infeasible to enforce the sort of intellectual property rights that we used to have through most of the modern era.</li><li>Politicians being unwilling to take steps to limit the spread of technology that allows laws to be flouted.</li><li>Something else - nobody's fault, just a senseless tragedy perhaps?</li></ol>I'm asking because after my satori on the matter (which I told about earlier in the thread) I've come to see these long-winded piracy discussions as fundamentally based on attribution error: people complain about a factual matter like digitalization and consequent freedom of information as a moral failing of the people involved when the deck is actually so very stacked against any opposite solution - it's difficult to see how we could actually do anything but adapt to the situation, unless we're supposed to crawl back into a cave and turn out the lights as we go. This is really no different from complaints about any other new technology, such as genengineered plantlife or telegraph lines or whatever you care to name; all of those technologies have been involved in similar debates where the argument seems to be motivated in half by professionals complaining about their work security and in half by the same people painting devils on the walls for laymen to get worried about. Seems like this has never worked in practice, though - even something as insanely dangerous as nuclear weapons seem to find their way into the hands of basically anybody who wants some hard enough.<br/><br/>I've no particular nit to pick with you specifically on this, Anna - what you said about the matter just piqued my curiousity when you stated that you "do not want people to be free to steal your art". The obvious question that came to me when reading this was: do we really have a choice here? Does what you want matter - not because somebody else's opinion would matter more, but rather, does <i>anybody's</i> opinion on this matter? Is it really possible to turn back the clock, or are there technical solutions in the horizon that really seem like credible ways of safeguarding IP in ways that do not make disproportionate sacrifices in individual freedoms and efficiency of the culture industry? If the only alternatives of the future are to make art like we make security or healthcare or public transportation - by public investment, that is - or to take down the Internet to stop piratism... is that any choice, really?<br/><br/>(For what it's worth, I don't think that the only alternatives are effectively enforced IP laws and public financing of public art. There are other solutions, such as art as a service, private patronage, sales of spin-off product and so on and so forth. The question remains the same, though - is IP really so important to the culture industry that we're willing to make the sacrifices necessary to stop others from doing free distribution of IP-protected culture? I myself don't believe so as an artist; I'm willing to take what advantage remains out of the IP-protected culture industry on its way out, but if I can't hack it in a free culture environment, then I don't deserve to - nobody, not even myself, is entitled to having a job at the expense of public good.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284394/#Comment_284394" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T07:36:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  7:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like paying creative people for the things they create.

You can't know the real value of a text until you read it; however, the value is decreased when it is read as you cannot unlearn what you have read.  In other words it comes down to three conflicting factors, <b>you can't judge a book by its cover</b> and <b>there's no point in paying for it once you've read it</b> (although as this is less true for reference texts than fiction, an advantage for RPGs).  However, <b>you're going to like something more if you've paid money for it</b> (based on social psychology/psychoeconomics).  So, why would you shell out for an RPG if you couldn't read it to determine its value?  Once the texts are available, even if its good, why would you pay for it anyway?  Would you have liked it more if you'd payed for it?

But we're not talking about theoretical secrets locked in someone's brain or on someone's private laptop, we're talking about <i>published</i> products.  And "publish" means, I'd like to point out, "to make public."

Example from my own life: I read nearly every Chuck Palahniuk book up through, oh, Lullaby I think, from books I checked out from the local library.  I currently own copies of them, purchased from bookstores.  This isn't, of course, because I felt any particular moral or ethical urge that Palahniuk be compensated for his work, but rather because I liked the books a lot and wanted to be able to reread them again whenever I wanted.  Now, many people don't enjoy or bother rereading fiction, so maybe I'm an edge case.  But still, saying there is <b>no</b> point paying for it once you've read it is a bit strong.  I would certainly agree that there is much <b>less</b> reason to pay for it, though.<br/><br/>Now, as I always do when these threads come up, I'll link to something<br/><a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/about/#freedownload" rel="nofollow">Cory Doctorow's explanation for why he gives ebooks away for free</a><br/>It's a longish explanation, so I'm not going to quote it all here.

The record industry's ridiculous holy war against file-sharers (more than 20,000 music fans sued and counting!) exemplifies the absurdity of trying to get the food-coloring out of the swimming pool.

Different laws, different departments of the government, different standards.</p>\n<p>This is about US law, of course. I know the EU has different, and often more reasonable, standards, but since the EU, US, Japan, and others have agreed to enforce each others' IP laws, this is relevant, at least, to everyone here, even if there are interesting specifics that I don't understand.</p>\n<p><strong>Patents</strong> are granted in order to make an idea public. The tradeoff is, an inventor of a process makes the idea public and no one but the US government can use that until the patent expires (generally, 20 years after it's filed), with the consequences being that there's a huge chunk of documentary evidence to show in court in a lawsuit. What that means is, all patents are inherently published, even if they're for <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/08/05/apparatus-for-facili.html" rel="nofollow">insane, nonfunctional things</a>.</p>\n<p>That same office covers <strong>trademark</strong>, which is what makes a product or service recognizable. The Superman logo is a trademark,</p>\n<p><img alt="Superman" src="http://www.teesforall.com/images/Superman_Logo_Royal_Shirt.jpg"/></p>\n<p>as is the particular color of green of the Apple Newton,</p>\n<p><img alt="Newton" src="http://www.loganstechtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/368px-apple_newton.jpg"/></p>\n<p>the grill of a Jeep</p>\n<p><img alt="Jeep" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRlQqNSEwvVXTdD9x_28YblPwQi62ySdWP2k6QdFzTfjSt82QA&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__sd10sf9eBH-JXKbzbdBdBNG1KeU="/></p>\n<p>or BMW</p>\n<p><img alt="BMW" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLPaBDWyQqtPIc_E5HDwrVBei58391pMLhrQ3l22XFs5hccdk&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__tSY0WS9tSusNZM-8TO6ssei_oRI="/></p>\n<p>or Conan's appearance</p>\n<p><img alt="Conan" src="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/conan4.jpg"/></p>\n<p>... even if I modify it, but it still bears a "distinctive likeness"</p>\n<p><img alt="Real, Actual Photo" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1392732/stevepernan.png"/></p>\n<p>These have to be renewed. If they stop being used to sell a particular thing for a certain amount of time, they're no longer trademarked. I don't remember how long it is, but it's not very long. This doesn't <em>quite</em> mean that you can use an old Pepsi logo...</p>\n<p><img alt="Pepsi" src="http://www.zlok.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/old-pepsi-double-dot-logo-coaster.jpg"/></p>\n<p>... because you can trademark a word or phrase, and "Pepsi-Cola" and "Pepsi" are both trademarked separately.</p>\n<p>Please note that there's an important distinction here that's often missed in these conversations: just because T-Mobile has trademarked their particular pink...</p>\n<p><img alt="T-Mobile" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSM_J9balZm7j104bsDlozqLbnPokjLegUfAPqSFlOZRb5T0iw&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__S5sTpTvHtlNXbpLDWP5ZPmpSdTU="/></p>\n<p>... doesn't mean "no one can use pink" or "has to pay T-Mobile whenever they say pink" or whatever other ridiculous hyperbole gets brought up in these discussions. What it <em>does</em> mean is that no one can run <em>a telecommunications company</em> while using that color without setting themselves up for a big, obvious lawsuit. In it, T-Mobile would claim that the defendant <em>diluted their trademark</em>, making it <em>less valuable</em>, and <em>confusing their customers</em>. They would get a reward based on the amount of damage the defendant had done to their brand \u2014 customers that went to the defendant instead of T-Mobile, thinking it was T-Mobile, for instance. That reward can, of course, be zero, or even a countersuit.</p>\n<p>You get a trademark by using a symbol consistently in business. If you put a \u2122 by it, it makes it very clear. If you register the trademark with the USPTO, they let you put a \xae by it, which means it's registered, and they've got good documentation of the trademark.</p>\n<p>Note that, if I were to start publishing a game called Agon without first contracting with John, he could sue me. If I published a game about Macedonian Bronze-Age supermen competitively fighting monsters and called in Noga, where you held dice in each hand, and had a 1-d range board, and burned up your fate in order to keep going in the hope that you'd get to become a legend, <em>he'd have no claim</em>, unless he patented the rules (which you can do, but is very expensive and difficult to prove.)</p>\n<p><strong>Copyright</strong> is most of what we care about here. Copyright law is to give a creator a monopoly on the benefits of a created thingYou get the copyright on something just by creating it. You can register it, but copyrighted things are usually pretty obvious. If I reprinted all of John's words, or even a significant portion of them, in Noga, he'd again have a suit. If I paraphrased them, he wouldn't.</p>\n<p>I'd just be a dick. Or I'd be Paizo.</p>\n<p>So, this makes a lot of sense when you print things on paper (or sculpt them in steel, or whatever) and copying them is expensive, and therefore typically done for profit.</p>\n<p>But when "publishing" is the same as "torrenting", that's a different thing, even if its not legally a different thing. If I have a krewe that plays on Wednesday nights, and I want everyone to read the rules before then, so I send them a PDF, I've technically set myself up for a lawsuit. If I download a game because I want to know if it's got rules for stone elves, and it does, so I buy it, I've done the same.</p>\n<p>That is, <em>the law does not accept these as "Fair Use"</em>, which is, to say, <em>the very reason copyright exists</em> \u2014\xa0to get creative works out into the culture by giving benefits to the creator.</p>\n<p>What's happened is, copyright law has become a powerful cudgel in the hands of people who own the creative works of <em>others</em>. Those interests have managed to get laws changed so copyright expires not in 75 years, but 100 years. Since those laws are supposed to support creation, how does a 100 year sunset help a creator? That creator's dead. Their children have benefitted. No, the other beneficiary is, for instance, Walt Disney \u2014\xa0the company, not the dude \u2014\xa0who get to keep Steamboat Willie to keep paying their stockholders, defying the laws that got him created.</p>\n<p>Brian, the RIAA values MP3s at between $150,000 and $200,000/track. Imagine you're a 15 year old with a full 160G ipod. If tracks average 2 minutes, that's 80,000 tracks, give or take, so that's $12,000,000,000. (Sorry, I couldn't find the one that was estimated to be worth world-economy money. But a moderately sized high school could easily have 100 full iPods of pirated tracks, and that's the right order of magnitude.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Here in Finland it's a clearly enshrined principle that making personal copies of whatever is legal, including sharing those copies with friends. It only becomes piracy when you're mass copying at scale and intent that are pretty far out of the realm of personal use such as roleplaying. So basically, outside use license agreements that might limit these rights (if you can get the license to stick, that is - I'm not convinced those are legal in the open market), nothing prevents me from copying all your games to all my friends completely legally. Clearly the only way to protect your creator's rights is to keep your stuff out of Finland <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>As an interesting side detail, the Finnish right to personal copying is justified in part by blank medium taxes that are collected on empty hard drives, blank CDs and such as part of their sales price and then given to the IP mafia to distribute to creators. In other words, I pay protection money to the local music industry for the right to make copies of your games. No idea why they don't require these extra taxes on blank paper, which seems like a prime suspect for making personal copies.<br/><br/>Despite the Berne convention and relentless pressure from international media corporations, copyright laws tend to have these small differences in detail from place to place. Nothing monolithic and immutable about them. Not that they don't try their hardest to homogenize this stuff, such as when they added those wretched "effective protection" clauses to the law in Finland as well to try to stop cracking. Now we have a funny law that allows me to make personal copies of stuff as long as I don't override effective anti-piracy measures while doing it - how I would copy something that was effectively protected in the first place is something I don't understand, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284426/#Comment_284426" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:00:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:00AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 11:02AM by Johnstone.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>As an interesting side detail, the Finnish right to personal copying is justified in part by blank medium taxes that are collected on empty hard drives, blank CDs and such as part of their sales price and then given to the IP mafia to distribute to creators.

Because of the copying levy on blank CDs and such that is payed to the Canadian and American music industries, the courts have decided that we are legally allowed to download (but not upload) the musical recordings of both Canadians and Americans. I don't think this extends to the legal right to copy pdfs, though there is an allowance for personal use among friends.<br/><br/><br/>edit: Oh, and it is also possible to apply for a refund of this levy by submitting receipts and paperwork to the government.

It's a limited monopoly, so that the producer of creative works can profit from them: a democratic approach to funding creative works.  <br/><br/>So at its base, what matters to me is that the artists and writers who are creating things I want to see, hear, read, or use get compensated fairly.  And when I think about how I feel about various forms of copyright infringement, this winds up being the fundamental issue for me.<br/><br/>It also explains why unauthorized copies of indie games bother me more than unauthorized copies of corporate games.  If I have an illegitimate copy of the D&amp;D 4e manuals, the percentage of money that the creators see from my potential sale is miniscule.  Also, I don't play D&amp;D4, so I don't stand to gain if they continue producing new material.  If I have an illegitimate copy of Bliss Stage, that's Ben Lehman out $12.  (I think it was $12.  I bought it a couple years ago.)  Ben writes amazing games, and I want him to write more.  <br/><br/>(So yeah, according to my personal ethics, it's legitimate for me to download Bliss Stage on a P2P network, so long as I send some money to Ben.  That's true, but it winds up being more practical, if I want a Bliss Stage PDF, to actually buy it from Ben directly.)<br/><br/>This is one of those places where I think we can argue over what's legal, we can argue over what's ethical, and we can argue over what's practical -- because all three concerns are in different places right now.  We just need to distinguish between legal, ethical, and practical arguments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284443/#Comment_284443" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:33:45+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:33AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Anna</b>,<br/><br/>I know your work first-hand, I love it and I wish you the best in all your endeavors. I absolutely do not want people like you to get hosed. I want creative people to prosper, and I also want to discard the outdated assumption that they can only prosper by selling their own work like it was groceries.<br/>In the world as we know it firsthand, only middlemen have prospered, and only by setting up oligopolies and enforcing their own interests in the most unfair ways. Those need to be disposed of first, I agree, and creator ownership (in the face of middlemen) is a priority. Why is copyright <i>alienable</i>, anyway? That clearly shows how the compensation of creators is and ever was a rhetorical trick performed by middlemen at everybody else's expense.<br/>But as a creator and <i>moral</i> owner of your own work you can't just rely on artificially engineering a limitation in availability in order to profit from it. I contend that you shouldn't <i>have</i> to do that just to make a living, that's just not fair and should not be assumed to the only way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>For what it's worth, I don't think that the only alternatives are effectively enforced IP laws and public financing of public art. There are other solutions, such as art as a service, private patronage, sales of spin-off product and so on and so forth.</blockquote>\nPublic financing as the standard answer, I admit, comes with a lot of problems attached (or, rather, it unavoidably hints to even larger problems with the management of existing political entities). Once upon a time patronage was the "default" mean for artists to live, much like the alienation of copyrights for money later become, and of course carried lots of problematic implications... but with digital technologies, "patronage" is now bound to be a different thing than it was, surely bringing new and different problems we don't yet anticipate. Which is actually my point: there are unlimited possible ways to explore for making creative endeavors a gig people can live off, and we'd rather be exploring some than sticking to a XIX Century model of "intellectual property" the book-printing mafia cooked up to screw novel writers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284449/#Comment_284449" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:37:33+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>The value of text media is a tricky thing, not unlike the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  You can't know the real value of a text until you read it; however, the value is decreased when it is read as you cannot unlearn what you have read.  In other words it comes down to three conflicting factors,<b>you can't judge a book by its cover</b>and<b>there's no point in paying for it once you've read it</b>(although as this is less true for reference texts than fiction, an advantage for RPGs).  However,<b>you're going to like something more if you've paid money for it</b>(based on social psychology/psychoeconomics).  So, why would you shell out for an RPG if you couldn't read it to determine its value?  Once the texts are available, even if its good, why would you pay for it anyway?  Would you have liked it more if you'd payed for it?  Round and round we go.</blockquote>\nThe true "value" of text media is something of a higher order than the utilitarian, Mr. Miller.

Copyright only covers a particular expression of an idea, while a patent covers the entire mechanism. So, let's say I'm Dean Kamen and I've just invented the Segway and want to patent it as, "Method for Making Healthy People Fatter". Assuming that no one has other patented (or there exist otherwise pre-existing methods) for making people fatter, then I have a patent on not only the balancing soft/hardware, but also the entire fatter-people-making process. What I <em>don't</em> have a patent on are: electrical vehicles, 2-wheeled vehicles, single person transportation, or anything else that already exists. So what John would have to prove is that there are unique, patentable elements to Agon (I think there probably are), and then patent those mechanisms.*</p>\n<p>However, if I make a Segway, then you reproduce it as a piece of art, it's either infringing my copyright or it's Fair Use. That's a matter of a lawsuit (and whether I'd want one) where I recover compensation for whatever sales I've lost from you selling my work. I think that would be a pretty hard case to prove in court, but fucked up shit is happening with these laws all the time.</p>\n<p>*Note that this is several thousands of dollars and often years before the patent is accepted.

So it's not only costly and very hard to begin with, it's also completely pointless to the rest of the world. The members of the BSA (Business Software Alliance, a sad excuse of a company that is actually Microsoft, Adobe and Autodesk working as racketeers(1)) have been pushing for years for Europe to adopt Software Patents (that would also cover game rules: a procedure is a procedure) and almost got away with with the EU Commission, but fortunately the EU Parliament overruled them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to close, a brief story about the post-RIIAA world: some years ago I followed a link from a post on Chad Underkoffler's blog to a video of a live performance of Creepy Doll by Jonathan Coulton(2), liked what I heard and did a google search. I discovered JoCo's website, and that he actually released his songs (beautiful, witty songs) under a copyleft license that actually allows anybody to re-distribute them for free. No, I'm serious!<br/>\nSo I downloaded a dozen of songs, and I enjoyed them so much that I actually went back and <i>bought</i> an album that contained songs I either already had or could easily and legally find online, directly from the author. 100% of my money went to his pockets.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently he's been contacted by labels, he did his math, and said "Thank you, but no thank you"(3). Because he would have had to both stop releasing his music <b>AND</b> to earn <i>much less</i> even when (IF) selling many many more songs. This is an artist that earns a living with his art, has a slew of devoted fans and basically lives touring and playing and composing. Which being a musician he kinda likes, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) I can expand, but I think it's OT here.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) Which would be an illegal thing, if JoCo did not release his songs under a CreativeCommons copyleft license, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\n(3) Does this story <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=20139.0" rel="nofollow">ring any bells?</a> Yeah, that's what I thought too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284477/#Comment_284477" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T12:57:41+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 12:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 1:06PM by renatoram.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Joshua another good one on patents that's not widely known: the Patent Offices has no obligation whatsoever about checking <i>what</i> you are patenting. If the application is correctly filed, and the fee is paid, sooner or later you get a patent. What this earns you is an official date on the patent application, basically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Patent Offices receives hundreds of thousands of applications: they don't have the manpower to READ all of them nor the scientific and technical competence to UNDERSTAND them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been egregious cases of really, really ridiculous patents granted recently: I distinctly remember Canada's PO granting a patent for the <b>wheel</b> for Eris' sake. But I think can enumerate at least half a dozen really dumb ones if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you say, why would someone bother to pay and patent something that's clearly already out there? I have two words: Litigation Companies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese companies buy lots of cheap, obscure patents, and consist of 100% legal department. They sue people on the basis of their bogus patents, then either win (the side with the best lawyers wins, often) or (more often) they settle, makign thousands if not millions of dollars out of thin air.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other use of huge libraries of patents is to maintain the balance of patent cold-war: if Microsoft sues IBM over some random idiocy (they have lots) then IBM brings their (apparently huge) patent library and reply that they'll countersue over patents X, Y and Z. And both parts back down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, that's billions of dollars wasted for literally nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n(edited a couple of times for small corrections)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284478/#Comment_284478" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T13:01:41+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  1:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>What if you don't copy whole passages but you use a lot of similar terminology?  Could it be, I dunno, a trademark (or some other kind of IP law) violation if you have Fate points, Divine Favor, and Name dice, and you give the same names to the stats like Arete and ummm... it's been awhile since I played Agon, so I'm not actually remembering a lot of distinctive terminology from it, but Agon is just the example, so I'm sure you know what I'm getting at.</blockquote>\nThere are not many prior cases of rpg lawsuits to settle this sort of stuff on, but basically this doesn't hinge on trademark, but on copyright - the issue in using similar terminology is whether you're actually copying the representation of the idea. I seem to remember that this was the logic behind all those '80s games that used to have the same stats that D&amp;D used, except they'd call Constitution "Vigor" or whatever to make sure that they don't cross the line into copying the specific expression. Personally I could totally see how a game with colorful, specific terminology could be considered a distinct work just on the strength of that terminology even if the actual paragraphs of text were not copied; this is the same logic that would be used if I decided to write a new novel about Harry Potter - even if I didn't market the novel with the name of Harry Potter (thus for the sake of argument dodging the trademark issue), I could still run afoul of copyright law on account of the idea of "Harry Potter" being a distinctive character and thus a work of art separate from books he stars in. Copyright protects more than whole sentences, in other words - it protects all expression, which might well include things such as character identity, setting identity and even terminological identity.<br><br>Of course this whole idea of "form" vs. "idea" is infinitely deconstructable, but courts work as courts do - precedent is established, often with little logic between different mediums of art, and then people do their best to not run afoul of established lines of good conduct. In truth almost all legal thinking on rpgs is pure speculation simply because rpg game texts are really quite unique as literature, but also so marginal as to make authoritative legal interpretation on the matter nearly non-existent. For instance, one thing I've been wondering about myself - why is a rpg book about a literary property not a fair use matter of literary analysis if the game text consists purely of literary analysis of the target property? After all, nobody would consider suing a literary critic for discussing the structure and content of a work of art in depth, so why would this change when the critic also adds "rules" that reverse-engineer the work of art? Perhaps rpgs are actually literary critique and therefore able to rely on fair use instead of commercial licensing - I've never heard of anybody testing this sort of thing in court, so it's all idle speculation.<br><br>I'm just about 1/10th of the American lawyer that an American layman would be, incidentally, on account of the US law not being my own chief concern.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The intention, of course, is to have a personal interaction with someone who bought something I made. The absence of torrents <em>might</em> mean that any of my customers who would be otherwise inclined to torrent the game, don't, because they feel it's not right.</p>\n<p>I'm personally agnostic on that. I'm not sure it's not right, but I'm not sure it is. My guess is, since I don't sell many PDF-only copies (most people buy the book/PDF bundle), it would reduce some number of bundle sales by the $5 bundle price increase. If it increased sales by 1/3, it would make up for that handily. But I really don't know.</p>\n<p>I <em>have</em> noticed that people who only buy the PDF either never say anything about the game at all, which implies to me that they never play it (as far as I can tell); or buy it with some motive between dismissive and hostile, usually to say that they did, too play a Forge Game. There's apparently a guy on an Italian forum right now telling people that Shock: is about race war, and that "My Life with Boss" is played with completely different rules than it actually is. It's pretty clear that he's Google Translating games, then playing them in bad faith. Some significant portion of PDF sales are these guys. (N.B.: the guy reportedly has a bug up his ass about Reptoid control of the One World Government or something, so really, he's a perfect candidate for a  Shock: Protagonist.

But I think the advertising potential of pirating is generally overlooked, so I'm deliberately emphasizing it here.<br><br>Edit: Ok, having thought about it more, here's the thing about podcasts, actual plays, reviews, etc. When I hear about the game, the pitch will excite me to one of three levels: 1. I'm willing to check it out if it's easy to do so. 2. I want to check it out, and am willing to dig a little to do so. 3. I want the game now, and am willing to buy it sight unseen if necessary.<br><br>Most games fall under the first category, a decent few fall under the second, and very very few fall under the third (Apocalypse World is the only real example I can come up with, actually). Grabbing the pdf off demonoid or rapidshare is easy. So is skimming a text to see if it looks appropriately awesome. I'll do that for pretty much any game that catches my eye in any of the three categories. If it still looks awesome, it gets bumped into the second category and I sit down and read the whole thing. <br><br>Digging through reviews and actual plays to get the little nuggets of systemy goodness is a lot more work. Neither form is intended to convey system knowledge the way a rulebook is. Therefore, getting an accurate view of how things work is a lot more effort than if I could just sit down and read the thing. Some games (the ones in the second category) are worth it. When my copy of Universalis arrived, I knew every single rule in the book already, with exactly one exception. It took me a couple of days worth of reading reviews and actual plays to get to that point, but it was worth it because Universalis is badass. Shock:, to be fair, has probably reached that point. When I have some free time, I'll do a similar trawl through reviews and actual plays to reconstruct the system, and see if it's as good as I hope. But this is a pretty decent investment of time and energy, and a relatively small number of games catch my eye enough to be worth it.<br><br>Incidentally, even if I don't end up buying a game I read, it's now accurately logged in my brain's list of RPGs. I've been able to recommend all sorts of games to people, because I had read the rules and knew it had the features they were looking for. I think one of my friends (who is normally all about trad games like Shadowrun) is about to buy Polaris on the strength of one of those recommendations.<br><br>It's possible that I'm an extreme outlier, and my anecdotes are completely useless when considering the larger picture. But I would be a little surprised if that were the case.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284661/#Comment_284661" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T12:41:01+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 12:41PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Posted by Christopher Weeks:<br>\n<br>\nHey Ryan, I know you have a business to protect, but I'm wondering if you could say what you really mean here, and maybe without such wild disrespect.&gt;Posted by fnord3125  <br>\nAnd "publish" means, I'd like to point out, "to make public."                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

But that's OK; it's far, far from over. This gets discussed <em>all the time</em> in fact. As you can imagine, it's of great import to the creators of games, books, and other IP. Your points are very common, and for them to work, pirating my games would have to result in at least the same number of sales.</p>\n<p>Now, as I said, the people who buy PDFs don't seem to me to play the game, but it's a vanishingly small number of sales anyway, so it's not at all statistically significant. From my perspective, you're probably right; people copying the game (and I just found v1.2d, complete with the free files, on a pirate site \u2014\xa0looks like it's been there since February, when I was out of print for three months) are either <em>not my customers anyway</em> or they're checking it out before buying, as you say.</p>\n<p>That said, it's a tenuous argument to make. Why <em>are</em> they buying the books? If they're getting it from that pirate site, why do they almost always buy the PDF? There are economic forces here that we do not understand, I think. My suspicion is that it's the same force that makes Kickstarter work.</p>\n<p>But it's a big risk. If I really went whole hog and sharewared Shock: what would happen? Would I ever sell another copy again? I need to make those sales. They feed me and pay for my internet.</p>\n<p>Here's one thing I can offer: when I get a PDF order, I immediately send out an email with the PDF attached. That's faster than any torrent I've ever downloaded. Plus, I usually say something weird and funny. When competing with free, I think there's something to that.</p>\n<p>Ryan, what you have is the <em>right to sue</em>.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Look at it another way. I run a POD operation. At any given time, I am sitting on hundreds of client files for their role playing games, works of fiction, card games, etc. If I were to off and print copies for myself and sell, the publisher/designers that were my clients would not have "lost" anything physical; have had nothing physical "stolen" from them. But if I just start printing the things en mass and start selling them, do people here REALLY think I would not have stolen from those publishers? REALLY? If I duplicate the intellectual property digitally or by making hard copies, its still still theft, plain and simple, unless I was granted permission by the IP holder. It really is that simple. To me people wanting to be able to copy IPs for free, without permission, is just attempts at trying to justify theft and from there its just a hop skip away from being able to justify being able to come into my house next and take whatever they want from there also.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>No, it's <em>not</em> that simple. As explained, it is not theft by any standard but your made-up one. It's theft the way driving annoyingly slow on the highway is \u2014 it's costing people gas, brakes, and hours of their finite lives. But really, that's not theft. It's just unethical. Theft is a matter of law, not your personal ethics.</p>\n<p>That said, copyright exists for <em>precisely</em> the reason you're talking about. Printing presses used to find books that were popular, print them, and sell them. I remember a notable story in which a printer send a letter of thanks to an author for making him his life's earnings. Copyright is there specifically to defeat the kind of printing you're talking about on every technical level. It's precisely the process Ben Franklin was discussing when he started encoding that law. Only the printing technology has changed.</p>\n<p>Digital copies of digital information are <em>not</em> that precise thing. No one is making a profit, for one thing, because it costs practically nothing to reproduce them, so they don't need to. The landscape has changed, but the law has not. Frankly, I look forward to a day when I can tell the difference between somebody copying my game and then buying it (or telling someone else they should, and then their friend does); and someone copying it, playing it, having a good time, then writing me an irate email and telling me my dice mechanics are unnecessarily fiddly. As it stands, I can't really tell those apart. In one case, it makes people happy (and eventually profits me). In the other case, it's Internet bullshit, which <em>costs</em> me.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PogueMahone" title="PogueMahone"><img alt="PogueMahone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PogueMahone">PogueMahone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284790/#Comment_284790" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-07T20:40:50+00:00" title="August  7, 2010  8:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2010 1:14AM by PogueMahone.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Theft is a matter of law, not your personal ethics.</blockquote>\nExactly. <br><br/>I wish I'd seen this thread earlier because IAAL (though I've never practiced criminal law). The words are different because the concepts are different. Under common law, theft is actually a broad term that includes embezzlement, larceny, larceny-by-trick, etc. The Model Penal Code has slightly different definitions, and the individual states have all codified them and I'm sure each has its little minor differences. But, larceny, which is what everyone is talking about, is defined as the taking and carrying away of another's <b>personal property</b> with the intent to <b>permanently deprive</b>. Personal property means tangible property, in other words not real property and not intellectual property.<br/><br/>As many people up-thread have written, the type of copyright infringement that everyone is talking about is not a criminal violation, but gives the copyright owner a cause of action against the infringer. See <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00000501----000-.html" rel="nofollow">17 USC 501</a>. As a couple of people have pointed out up-thread, there is criminal infringement, but generally it requires that the infringer do so for commercial gain. See <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00000506----000-.html" rel="nofollow">17 USC 506</a>.<br/><br/>Some may view this post as being pedantic, but I think, here, the words matter. From the perspective of the infringer, it's the difference between getting sued or being imprisoned. I think that's a pretty important difference. <br/><br/>What's the difference for the creator? I think what the piracy-is-theft posters are saying by using the word theft, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is <b>both</b> that: 1) piracy is theft because the infringer is literally stealing money, in the form of a lost sale, from the creator; and 2) that the pirating of a creator's work is a non-economic injury to the creator (i.e., a slap in the face).<br/><br/>I'm not going to argue with the second point. There have been posts by creators on this thread that indicate that feelings about seeing one's own work on file-sharing sites run the gamut. I've seen my own creative works on dodgy russian pay-to-download sites and music blogs and I recall feeling neutral and positive, respectively, about it, but I imagine my feelings would have been much different if paying my rent ever depended on selling my creative works. <br/><br/>I will argue with the first point, because it's a matter of degree. Using an example up-thread, if a thief steals a stereo from an electronics store the store is out not just the profit from the lost sale but the wholesale value as well, because they have to purchase another stereo to sell. If an infringer downloads a digital copy without paying, the creator is out the profit from the lost sale only (Which itself is arguable, but let's assume 100% of the infringers would have purchased the work. Also, one could probably argue that the creator also loses the cost of production, but I'm not going to argue with myself.) <br/><br/>So, does copyright infringement suck for the creator and deprive him of money? Yes. Is it the same as theft? No.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>There's also been some discussion about the purpose of copyright. Someone quoted the Copyright Clause from Art. 1 Section 8 (aka the Enumerated Powers of Congress) of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the right to create legislation: \n<blockquote>"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for <b>limited Times</b> to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."</blockquote>\n"Science" above means "learning or knowledge," not the colloquial or today's dictionary definition.<br/><br/>The purpose of granting Congress this power was not to reward authors for their creations. It was to encourage authors to create works that would after a time go into the public domain, thereby benefiting everyone. See <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=01-618#section3" rel="nofollow">Eldred v. Ashcroft 537 US 186 (2003), J. Breyer dissenting</a>.<br/><br/>The first Copyright Act granted a term of 14 to 28 years. The most recent act provides that the term is the life of the author plus 70 years. (<a href="http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm" rel="nofollow">A comprehensive list of the length of copyright terms</a>) Some jurists have argued that continually extending copyright terms perverts the plain meaning of "limited Times" and the constitutional purpose of copyright. In fact, there was a SCOTUS case where the issue was whether extending the copyright of existing works was unconstitutional, but the majority in a 7-2 decision held that it wasn't. See <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=01-618#section1" rel="nofollow">Eldred v.

A lot of theft is immoral, and therefore deserving of exactly the sort of 'wild disrespect' that Ryan aims at it.<br/><br/>At the same time, all of us inhabit capitalist societies within which resources are distributed outrageously unjustly, and within which many of the brightest, most creative people, who do exhausting jobs that provide society with immeasurable benefit, barely make enough money to put food on the table.<br/><br/>So: piracy is OK when you're poor, but wrong when you've got a substantial dispensable income. In the USA, I'd put this figure at about 20K per annum, give or take a bit for things like medical expenses etc.<br/><br/>I indulged in extensive file sharing without any shame or remorse whatsoever when I was working like a slave as a contingent college faculty member for trash wages with no job security. When I got a decent job, I simply stopped.

Since it is surely true, at least at some finite level, that someone pirating a digital good, at least some portion of the time, having got said good for free now will not buy it, thats a copy of the goods that were produced for which there were sunk production costs that can no longer be sold, thusly making each copy actually sold more expensive on the cost of goods side. Yes, I know, big raging debate on how much piracy leads to people not buying the PDF and the counter agruement that pirated copies can lead to hard copy sales (disregarding the possibility that maybe there is no hard copy) so the "percentage" of times piracvy actually costs a sale might be as low as .0000% or as high as 99%, but most probably not near either extremes, the point of cost accounting still stands.</blockquote>\nBut that's just accounting, right?  Stealing a stereo doesn't make other stereos more expensive to produce.  The creator doesn't have less than he did before.  The cost per unit of the development costs is just a made up number based on how many units are expected to sell.  Or, when a stereo is stolen there is a cost associated with replacing the stereo so the store can sell the same number.  This is what drives up the price of stereos with theft, you have to account to replacing a certain number of stolen ones.  But with digital piracy, there is zero replacement cost.  So there is only a loss on the creator side when a would-be-buyer pirates instead.  Will-never-buyer pirates cost the creator nothing.  However, differentiating the two would require omniscience or something close to it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>I don't see what there is for any sensible person to disagree with here, really.</blockquote>\nFor me, it's that the word 'theft' seems inappropriate.

That's what I was suggesting, but I didn't want to have a conversation with myself. I think the problem with the up-thread hypothetical that I reused of the thief in the electronics store is that the store is not the producer of the good. It's not a good analogy. \n<blockquote><br/>As a law its meant to encourage creativity and renewed vitility into the free market by preventing people that have spent zero time on energy on said creative works to simply have them for free without compensation to the creator. Copyright laws and by extension trademarks and patents all have dated sunset periods, so that society as a whole can eventually benefit from setting that idea free and its given the creator a reasonable time recoup and profit from the creation. <br/></blockquote>\nTrademarks are indefinite as long as they are in use. <br/><br/>It sounds like we basically agree here. I don't disagree with you that the current act is written for the benefit of producers. My point in my above post is that the benefit for producers was strictly a secondary concern constitutionally. The primary purpose was to encourage the creation of works for the benefit of society by incentivizing creators with an opportunity for uninhibited profit <b>for a limited term</b>. For example, the first phrase in the Copyright Act of 1790 is "An Act for the encouragement of learning...." Another example: in that act the first term lasted 14 years and could be extended another 14 years if the author wasn't already dead. Right, because extending the copyright is not going to encourage that dead author to produce more work, but it would "encourage...renewed [vitality] into the free market." (Actually, I'm not exactly sure what you mean there, but I'm assuming you mean "generate profit.") One could argue that if living authors see that a dead author is compensated then they themselves will be incentivized, but...<br/><br/>BTW, some people have argued that this is a romantic view of copyright in the 18th century. For one thing, I believe that most authors at the time sold their works outright to publishers, who then presumably held the copyright. But, my understanding comes from what was taught to me by my professors and what I've read in various SCOTUS opinions.\n<blockquote><br/>Copyright laws are dated now, not having been able to anticipate the rapid advances of information based technology, but that doesn't negate the need for the law and what it is meant to protect. Indeed, it argues for some updates to the law to adequately address new technologies. For one, given the rate that new technologies are able to distribute copyrighted works and rapid distribution systems can quickly move their printed cousins, I would make the arguement that the window for the protected period on copyrights should nbe dramatically shortened to more closely represent a more reasonable commercial lifespan of the works. In these days, I might park that at 20-25 years, with a requirement to keep the works in "commercial distribution" at specific benchmarks through that time period. Failure to do so would cause the works to become public domain after a certain period of continued lapse.<br/></blockquote>\nI agree that there is a need for reform of copyright law, and for what it's meant to promote. I'm not sure I understand how the speed and ease of distribution support a reduction in the term. But, I would say that rapid technological development makes the outcomes of hypothetical cases ridiculous. For example, say I pirate Zork and then get sued by the copyright owner. Market value is, what, $5 at most? The copyright owner may opt to seek statutory damages for which the statutory minimum is $750 per infringement. <br/><br/>P.S., If it isn't clear from everything I've written: I do not want authors to get ripped off by pirates. In fact, in law school I wrote a paper advocating an expansion of the moral rights of creators in the US.<br/><br/>-- Ara H.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PogueMahone" title="PogueMahone"><img alt="PogueMahone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PogueMahone">PogueMahone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284802/#Comment_284802" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T01:12:58+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  1:12AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2010 1:13AM by PogueMahone.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Maybe because the U.S. doesn't really recognize them (though much of the world does). Let me quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights_(copyright_law)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, which really nails it (emphasis added):\n<blockquote>Moral rights are rights of creators of copyrighted works generally recognized in civil law jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some common law jurisdictions. They include the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work. The preserving of the integrity of the work bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation. <b>Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights.</b> Even if an artist has assigned his or her rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work.</blockquote>\nPutting aside economic arguments against torrenting and such, an author has the right to control how his work is published. Let's say I publish a for-print game and someone scans it and drops it on a torrent site. That's wrong, because I have lost control of the medium in which I intended to publish it. Or consider I have published a PDF for free on my website and imagine that someone drops a copy on a torrent site. I may feel that this detracts from my relationship with the work and therefore it's wrong to torrent my free PDF without my permission. Perhaps I want to keep track of the number of downloads, or want visitor site data. Perhaps I want people who download my work to also read my web page and have a chance to give me their email for a mailing list. It doesn't matter. I have a moral right over my work and get to decide how that work is disseminated.<br/><br/>Those who posted bits of the Constitution are correct about what the law says, but what they seem to be missing is that <i>the Founders got it wrong</i> and that U.S. law has changed since then anyway. I believe\u2014and I realize you may disagree\u2014that copyright is actually a right that citizens have, but that there is a compelling government interest in limiting how long we exercise that right. Just as many of our other rights have limits (can't yell "fire" in a crowded theater, etc.). I'm not the only one who think that moral copyright is a fundamental right, since the entire Berne Convention\u2014to which the U.S. has been a party since 1989\u2014is based on that idea.<br/><br/>So let's put aside issues of profit loss, which are complicated anyway.

Authors have a moral right over their works, and people should respect them.</blockquote>\nThat is a good reframing of the question, I agree. I don't believe in author's moral rights as something more fundamental than economic rights, though - that is, they're still just rights that need to be balanced in society against corresponding responsibilities, and those responsibilities again against other rights and values that are affected by the exchange. As I argued in a couple of posts upthread, the real problem with creator rights at this point is that we can't afford to enforce them, not that they wouldn't be nice (or at least one possible arrangement). This goes for economic rights as well as moral rights.<br/><br/>That being said, we can divide creator rights in many ways, and one useful way of looking at it might be this: which rights do we have the luxury of consistently relying upon in the information age? There are good indications that classical copyright - right to control the distribution of the work - is not practical, but there are other rights that still are; for instance, the artist's moral right to be acknowledged as the creator of his work is <i>very</i> feasible still, insofar as any truths may be maintained in this world. If anything, the rapid transfer of information makes it more difficult to plagiarize or otherwise compromise a creator's right to be acknowledged as the creator. Another example of a feasible right is the range of rights to different ways of monetizing the work - despite the ease at which we can do free distribution today, it's not really massively easier to make money off piracy than it was twenty years ago, and I'm not really seeing this as changing: criminal profit is criminal profit, it's going to remain difficult to make money out of copyright crimes even as it's becoming almost impossible to prevent people from doing the same for free. It is likely that in the future the creator will still be the only one who gets to sell t-shirts printed with his creation, in other words.<br/><br/>The only moral right that is seriously compromised by the information age is the right to control the medium and manner of your work's presentation, which makes sense, as that's really just the commercial copyright described in a different way. There's nothing fundamental to this right, though, it's just as invented as any other rights we choose to advocate as a society. We'll just have to make do without it when enforcing it becomes impractical, just like the medieval Candlemaker's Guild of London had to ultimately bow before market realities and accept that enforcing their ancestral candle monopoly in the city was no longer feasible. I don't see this as a particularly horrendous future: no major harm will be caused to me if any of you decide to scan my book and distribute a badly scanned version in the Internet, especially if you clarify in there somewhere that it's a bad scan of a work that was originally intended to be distributed as a book. It'd be just prissy to get offended by such treatment, anybody can get the original if they really think that my vision of the work was so great that it can only ever be realized on paper.<br/><br/>Thus - shifting the discussion to moral rights is interesting, but it doesn't really free us from the necessity of establishing clearly what those moral rights are and who acknowledges and accepts them. Rights are only as valuable as the willingness and ability of individuals concerned and the society to enforce them, after all. When these rights themselves are undergoing massive changes, insisting on their unchanging nature and eternal validity is not the most useful reaction out of all the possibilities. Make no mistake, these values are changing - there is no doubt in my mind that in the long term the horrendously arbitrary practice of suing non-commercial private individuals for copyright infractions will be considered a cruel and unnecessary thing, little more than a panic reaction from large media companies slow to change with the times. When the great majority of the population routinely commits these infractions,when they've practically become the way society works, it's nothing more than legal bullying to pick some random individuals to prosecute for a crime to which millions of people are equally guilty.<br/><br/>In fact, one might argue that copyright as we know it has never actually protected IP from free distribution, but rather only from large-scale commercial exploitation; there has never been a time in history when the copyright laws would have primarily been targeted and utilized against private, non-commercial copying and distribution of materials. And now that we have technology that makes this form of distribution a significant part of the cultural landscape we see that apparently the people at large do not actually recognize a responsibility to not avail themselves of the cultural riches available to them. This should tell us something, shouldn't it? How credible is a law or an interpretation of a law that, when it becomes pertinent for the first time in history, is routinely and without hesitation broken by millions of people without any bangs of conscience? What sort of law is it, for what sort of nation, when it doesn't seem to be backed by the moral instincts of the populace? Perhaps it's a grave injustice that needs to be corrected by teaching people to recoil from freely distributed culture, but it's equally possible that it's something that we need to adapt to as culture professionals - make our money from different parts of the process instead of insisting on trying to plug the sieve by guilt-tripping people who are just following their natural curiousity and availing themselves of the immense cultural education available from the Internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284850/#Comment_284850" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T14:36:10+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  2:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Rights are only as valuable as the willingness and ability of individuals concerned and the society to enforce them, after all.</blockquote>\nAnd this is me continuing to encourage society\u2014you guys\u2014to enforce them, and not to shrug and say they're practically unenforceable. Hey, at some point, it might become impractical to enforce other, basic human rights, and I'll stand up for them then, too. It may come to be that the only tools I have at my disposal to protect moral copyright are peer pressure, shame, and bloody revolution. So be it. I'll start with the shame and peer pressure.<br/><br/>"The moral instincts of the populace" isn't always the best barometer of morality. There was a time in my nation's history that the majority of people didn't think certain people deserved the right to vote. Doesn't mean they weren't grievously wrong.<br/><br/>I think rolling over and just ignoring the problem or saying that we can just find new ways to make money is weak, personally. I think, as you put it, "guilt-tripping people" is a good start for facing a cultural problem like this right now. Before any kind of change can happen, people have to understand the problem, and shame is just one tool to help people understand. Apply your argument to the problem of plagiarism. I mean, it "works" just about the same way: it's too hard to stop kids from doing it; everyone is doing it anyway; the original author doesn't really lose anything; etc. No, dude. Copyright violation infringes on a person's rights and you shouldn't do it. <br/><br/>Other people have very clearly established what moral copyrights are, decades ago. This isn't that murky an area. (Certainly, the field of copyright <i>law</i> is murky, especially U.S. Fair Use doctrine: I must grant that. But not what moral copyright is.) I don't agree that the rights themselves are "undergoing massive changes." I think the technology has changed and, with it, people's understanding of how civil rights apply to new technology. And really, I'm not encouraging sending lawyers after individual infringers, a la RIAA and ASCAP. <br/><br/>All I'm asking is that we start from a position of "copying people's stuff illegally is wrong," and work from that premise to find solutions. There's a whole lot of rationalization happening in this thread, and I think it hurts people's moral rights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284852/#Comment_284852" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T15:18:04+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  3:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you about standing up for your convictions, Adam; by all means try to convince us and others as well that copyright is still deserved. I want to emphasize, however, that there are different sorts of rights that are granted for different reasons, and copyright is emphatically not an inalienable human right based on moral reasoning and nothing more. A just society can be arranged to work without copyright, which is not a moral issue, but a practical one. The only moral issue associated with copyright is the issue of contracting in bad faith; sometimes creators create things or make contracts about their creations without realizing the consequences, and that is sad and a moral problem when it could have been avoided by better laws, better morals or more understanding on the part of the creator about what he's getting into. In all this, however, creator rights are by and large a tool for preventing exploitation of people working to create particularly ephemeral things, not an end in themselves. For this reason we emphatically should <i>not</i> start from the premise that creator rights are a moral absolute, because then we end up propping up outmoded tools when we should be seeking to uphold the principles that inspired those tools in the first place: how can we ensure that the culture industry is supported by society efficiently and to the degree that would be optimal for the civilization? <i>This</i> is the fundamental question and just ignoring it to prop up copyright without first proving that it is entailed by the basic goal is pure conservatism: because it's been this way since I started in the business, it has to be this way in the future as well.<br/><br/>Can we control the copying of culture products without limiting personal freedoms of the liberal society and giving undeserved power to moguls of the culture industry?  If we can, then perhaps the time of copyright has not yet passed. My reading in the fields of cryptography and information technology in general seem to indicate that the theoretical prospects do not look good; we can either have relatively free and unmonitored transmission of information, or we can give that up to ensure that no copyright infractions happen. Were I to make the choice, we would retain freedom and security of private communication, as well as the freedom of the Internet over effective copyright enforcement. I specifically wouldn't want the sorry state of things we currently have, where copyright is de facto a dead beast, culture industry in the Internet works by entirely different rules, but old-moded corporations hold the legal threat of copyright over everybody's heads: when everybody breaks a law, it's better to get rid of the law than allow arbitrary enforcement.<br/><br/>I'm not particularly opposed to copyright myself as a historical phenomenon, but the way many fields of life work in the pressure of modern technology and copyright is starting to look just screwy. For instance, I've now waited five days for the privilege to use the Quarkxpress software I own because I need a registration file from the Finnish importer to make it work; perhaps they'll get around to providing that file one of these days. This sort of thing would not have been an issue before free digital distribution inspired copy protections, and it wouldn't be an issue in a software industry that worked primarily by the rules of free distribution. Only in trying to enforce principles that are no longer pertinent do we find these sad, annoying situations where I'm stuck with non-working software because I chose to not pirate it off the Internet. Good going, culture industry - but I don't think you can continue this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284856/#Comment_284856" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T15:40:36+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  3:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I want to emphasize, however, that there are different sorts of rights that are granted for different reasons, and copyright is emphatically not an inalienable human right based on moral reasoning and nothing more.</blockquote>\nMoral rights do, in fact, place copyright in the category of inalienable human right.

My point was not that creator moral rights as recognized in Finnish law among others are not natural rights, but rather that the copyright machine in total is not a moral right. Therefore we need to consider different rights separately and seek to distinguish the absolute from the merely utilitarian. I don't really think that all of the rights enumerated as creator moral rights are that absolute (I could see a just society without that funky visitation right, for instance), but perhaps some of them are. On the other hand, I'm almost certain that the creator's right to control his product's medium (and thus to practically control its distribution) is not an absolute moral right, no matter what the Berne convention says. (Didn't you just tell us to not be swayed by arguments from popularity, by the way?)<br/><br/>I'd like to hear why <i>you</i>, Adam, think that the rights you champion are absolute, natural and universal to such an extent that we cannot consider a different society. Unless I missed it, so far you've just claimed moral sanction, but not actually justified why you think that it should be given, unless you think that the Berne convention (a trade convention more than a human rights one, I would say) somehow has moral authority to dictate what's right and what's wrong. This discussion would certainly be very different if we all just accepted all creator rights, copyright included, on the basis of your word - then we could get into thinking of solutions, in fact, as you mentioned upthread.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            125 years might be read to mean that Berne is outmoded instead of authoritative, Adam. Berne is not usually listed among the great human rights achievements, and for good reason - the main achievement of that convention is economical: by requiring the signatories to respect copyrights internationally it enables more efficient and fair international culture industry. By forcing the signatories to extend their copyright protection spans to gain the trade benefits it has also contributed to making copyright the slow-moving, financially crucial instrument it is today. Although I'm not one to grant <i>any</i> holy text moral authority in philosophical examination, in this case I don't think the particular text even ranks as such: I might as well claim that traffic regulations are absolute moral laws because they're very similar in most countries, were established decades ago and are in some cases enforced by international treaties. Arguing that copyright is good because a 19th century convention undersigned by most civilized countries says so is a simple argument from authority. It works well enough if the other party is actually willing to be swayed by that authority, but I for one am not; how could I, when my main point in this discussion is very much that <i>Berne is outmoded and needs to be replaced</i>. Of course I'm not going to be convinced by an argument from the convention that I'm arguing against!<br/><br/>That being said, don't feel like I'm piling on you specifically - as you said, your opinion is not unreasonable, it just happens to be one for which I'd be interested in hearing more grounding. We've established that there are a variety of creator rights involved in file sharing in addition to copyright, and we've also found that the creator rights enumeration as established in the Berne convention is not accepted for the purposes of this discussion as a matter of course. Now, why should we accept Berne, with or without copyright? Is the convention itself somehow particularly authoritative, or are the creator rights enumerated by it really so powerful as to sway a reasonable man to suppor them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284864/#Comment_284864" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T16:43:20+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  4:43PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>The Berne Convention is not just a trade document. Geez. It starts, "The countries of the Union, being equally animated by the desire to protect, in as effective and uniform a manner as possible, the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works..." The rights of authors, people. But you're challenging my appeal to a document as my main argument, which is fair, but a little surprising. It's a document more widely accepted than the U.S. Bill of Rights, so I am surprised that there's such argument against it. But fine. I'll back away from the Berne Convention and give my own reasoning why moral copyright is not only important, but an actual inalienable right.<br/><br/>I feel that the moral rights in the Berne Convention sum up my feelings about copyright. Why do I agree with this treaty? Because I think without it, it is too easy to stomp on artistic expression, force people to sign away their rights for their creative works, and suppress creativity in society.<br/><br/>I think the right to control your medium is a vital part of the freedom of expression. If you can't control the medium, you can't control the message (see also Marshall McLuhan). If someone takes one of my RPGs and bundles it for distribution with F.A.T.A.L. and SenZar, I'd take great offense. If someone printed my words on the back of a Ku Klux Klan document, I'd take great offense. Without being able to control the medium and means of distribution of my work, I cannot prevent these things.<br/><br/>By maintaining my right to control the medium and means of distribution of my expression, I keep my expression pure. Without a means for pure expression, my freedom of expression is impinged. Do you require me to justify a moral right to pure freedom of expression now, too?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284865/#Comment_284865" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T16:44:41+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  4:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I really don't think I'm approaching this discussion from an unreasonable point of view.

Just as many other possible points of view are. That a "doctrine" has been in effect for 125 years, for example, doesn't mean, thankfully, that we shouldn't wish we could revise it.<br/>If you ask me for my own personal <i>moral</i> opinion, for example, I passionately believe that my right to be acknowledged as the author of my own work is as fundamental to a just human society as my right to not be stabbed to death while walking a street... In fact, I am appalled that under the current legislation (Italian, at least) I don't necessarily have such right when doing contract work: I recall heated arguments with the representatives of companies whose "policy" was not to list contributors by name (I was just a freelance hired to design a children's game, so what was I thinking?

The copying-for-own-archiving argument is a red herring, as it's covered by Fair Use.<br/><br/>And I guess Fair Use brings up an interesting point. In all places copyright is balanced against other rights, and that's where Fair Use gets its power. I don't think recent technological advances have changed people's rights to Fair Use, just made it easier to abuse other people's copyright.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284868/#Comment_284868" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T17:31:46+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  5:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not trying to be pedantic out of evil intent, Adam - I'm just asking justifications for points on which I disagree, no more.<br/><br/>For instance, I agree with you that there is a certain possibility of taint in the message when you do not control your medium. Medium affects the message, as your examples show. However, it's also true that expectations influence the message, and nothing is easier for an audience than to separate a creator's intent from an unfortunate medium. People are smart, and paradoxically the only reason for why we might make the jump from Adam to Ku Klux Klan is <i>creator rights</i> - we expect that you actually have some control over where your text appears, so we hold you culpable for some asshole printing it in a Ku Klux Klan yearbook. But if you did not have this right of control, or if we reasonable expected you to be unable to exercise it as is often the case in the Internet... then why would we assume that you have some association with this curious thing? It's the right that creates the expectation, and thus the right that creates the responsibility for the creator to be conserned, for the potential for shame or offense. It might be that as the information flow grows (the amount of information in existence has been growing geometrically for some time if I remember correctly - but the amount of information <i>exchange</i> has been growing faster still!) we lose any practical means of controlling where our work is used and how. Fortunately at the same time we also gain in critical understanding and lose any expectations of the creator having somehow preplanned this encounter with his work - we will know that Adam shouldn't be accused of being sympathetic for the Klan when we know that his work is out in the wilds, not under his control.<br/><br/>My own stand on this same matter is that aside from the self-servingly long copyright terms the Berne convention does not have any particular parts that I take offense with - its ideas are good for its time. The times are changing, however, and thus these things need to be re-evaluated from the ground up as old assumptions no longer hold sway. Is there any earthly way for us to enforce a creator's control of his medium? What needs to be sacrificed for this right to continue to exist as something more effective than a virtuous attitude? Is it worth it? As I described earlier in the thread, my own largely noncommittal opinion on copyright was changed when I realized that the issue under consideration is not at all whether the old copyright system is good or not - that is irrelevant when the rules of commerce are changing, and I actually lack the faith in there being a practical way for copyright to continue. Show me a practical way for it to happen where the cure is not worse than the disease, and then we will have a real conundrum in our hands. As things are, I have to support a drastic copyright revision simply because I don't want to sacrifice the digital revolution to maintain a system that is no more valuable or moral than any other economic set-up. Make no mistake - the culture industry moguls <i>are</i> willing lobby for mandatory, factory-installed anti-piracy equipment for your computers, and worse things still if they think they can get away with it. Theirs is an entrenched business, with massive amounts of virtual capital in the form of IP amassed over the 20th century, IP that only retains its value by the virtue of copyright law. Dismantling this single law upon which this commercial interest rests is easily a much more volatile proposition than the anti-smoking lobby could ever hope to be.<br/><br/>Without committing to any specific ideas for now, as I speculated upthread I might suggest carefully that we can practically probably preserve all creator rights except for the right to control private distribution and the right to control medium. Taking away scanners and monitoring private web traffic is a totalitarian pipe dream, and without those steps I see no way to reasonably stop digital piracy. (DRM systems are also a virtuous fantasy - we can talk about those, too, but the short of it is that there are some pretty good reasons to believe that there is no way to create a content wrapper that both allows enjoying the work and prevents copying it into an open format.) I could see the other rights as still maintainable in the digital world, however; this is good, as I appreciate my right to be acknowledged as a creator as much as anybody. For instance, I don't really see why we would need to allow unlimited commercial copying while we revise the Berne convention; if anything, the niche for commercial piracy dies a quick death once noncommercial digital distribution is completely legalized.<br/><br/>I do want to emphasize that I don't particularly oppose the idea that creators gain their rewards from selling copies of their work, which is the basic idea behind copyright. I subsist largely by that myself at the moment. If anybody can figure out a roadmap to a future where this sort of thing remains feasible without impinging on the cultural freedoms our generation has had the privilege to taste through the last 15 years of the Internet's development, I'm all for that. Perhaps some physical medium that is somehow not able to be digitalized? Book as a luxury product you don't <i>want</i> in a digital form? I can see many approaches and niches, but no one overbearing solution that would challenge free digital distribution as a serious competitor - the whole thing is just taking its first baby steps, and it's already the world's most powerful content platform by a fair margin, beating any library on the planet. That's an awful challenge to scale when innovating solutions that do not rely on force, terror and shame, but if somebody is up to the task, I'll support them all the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The most important thing is that I wasn't claiming that I was entitled to your work.  It isn't about me.  It's about you!  I was suggesting that maybe you have an obligation -- that's all your own, having nothing to do with me, to make the world better.  Aside from whether you have such an obligation, I think that *I* do: to provide to the world that which I can.  I write software for a living.  I help strangers on the net with their coding problems.  I help people and give stuff away -- mostly in small ways, all the time.  I'm not some kind of paragon of virtue, but I think that those of us with strengths that others don't have should share when we can.  I've been given *so much* by luck and by society...<br/><br/>Adam: <i>Wrong</i> is needlessly nebulous.  You're not an immoral person because you did that, right?  It's just that that behavior increases entropy.  And I never claimed that I'm opposed to copyright.  I was (poorly, I guess) trying to point out that you're just making assertions, as givens, rather than taking the time to explain *why.*  It's like claiming that it's "wrong."  How about instead, cultures that broadly respect something like copyright, by encouraging their members to improve the state of the art, make the world a better place at a much greater rate than do those cultures which do not?  If you said something like that, I'd just line up behind you.  But you're making this some kind of morality tale and it seems like you don't see that you're doing so all by yourself.

To recap, I believe moral copyright is a necessary extension of the freedom of expression. If you don't think freedom of expression is a right/wrong issue, then we have little common ground on which to meet.<br/><br/>Explaining *why* feels so much to me like trying to convince people that cold-blooded murder is wrong. It's a bit surreal. (No, Rafu, I'm not equating copyright violations with murder.) There is a morality component to it for me. Appealing to the Berne Convention or the U.S. Constitution is just my shorthand for saying, "for all the reasons those people wrote that." <br/><br/>When I point out that 90% of the countries of the world believe in copyright as a fundamental, moral right, I'm just saying, "Hey, maybe these people are onto something." This is much the same as saying, when millions of people illegally download songs, "Hey, maybe these people are onto something." Except in the case of the Berne Convention, a bunch of governments got together and decided that people needed some additional protection (a rare occurrence among governments), whereas in the case of Napster, a bunch of people got together and decided that they should get some music without paying for it. It's really hard to compare them.<br/><br/>Also, I don't understand arguments that claim that, because a right is impractical to protect, it is not worth protecting. These rights were worth protecting before peer-to-peer networks, before CD-RW, before VCRs, before cassette recorders... (And I'm well aware of levy systems like the AHRA and so on.) I agree that a culture's approach has to change with the times, but we can't just throw up our hands and ignore the problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284963/#Comment_284963" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T13:51:09+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  1:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Christopher Weeks wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\nRyan: Part of that's a straw man and part of my answer isn't what you expect, I guess.

I see impotent moralizing as much more of a defeatist route in this regard; it's not insignificant, but without an actual positive roadmap it's not better than the various chastity movements and such that the religious fundamentalists invent to ostensibly cure wean teenagers off sex. For a moral stand to mean something it needs to be combined with some practical suggestion more refined than "everybody should feel bad for doing what comes naturally".<br/><br/>In general it's true that moral intuition can't be forced, and thus we'll have to simply agree to disagree if that's all we have. I think that you exaggerage the amount of consensus the Berne convention has in the world, though, as the fact that governments uphold a particular piece of international law rarely means that the populations, or even those governments, particularly support it; it's just the existing status quo, and thus has precedence on its side. I'd be personally hesitant to argue that the politicos and industry lobbyists behind the current copyright consensus are somehow more moral, objective and compassionate people than the digital rights activists, cryptoanarchists and open culture advocates who oppose them in this matter. Painting everybody on that side of the fence with "they just don't want to pay for anything" is really quite simplistic.<br/><br/>Fundamentally: I think that the copyright system needs to be available for critique, we can't just set it aside and refuse to consider it because it's somehow morally perfect. This goes for any and all legal constructs, and if some of those should actually be absolute moral issues - then it's up to us to recognize the fact and respect them as such. The fact that something is written down in the US constitution or the Berne convention or the Holy Bible does not justify that content, only the content itself and the arguments put for it can do so. Mere moral authority only works when agreement has already been reached.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

By connecting the address to the web site with which it is registered, I can determine from incoming e-mail who has protected the address I gave them and who has not. That is, if I register at foo.com with e-mail address X, and then make sure I never use address X for any other purpose, then if I start getting spam sent to address X, I can be pretty sure that foo.com either sold address X, or got penetrated by someone who did.<br/><br/>In a decade of doing this, spam has been sent to addresses provided to <i>every single</i> porn site I registered with, while addresses provided to other types of sites have almost never received spam.<br/><br/>Consequently, I have no problem torrenting porn.<br/><br/>I'm much more picky about torrenting other stuff.<br/><br/>I have no problem with people sharing things I have created; it's one of the reasons everything I produce (be it software or rpg stuff) is free to begin with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It might not be superficially obvious, but that's pretty much what the piracy discussion amounts to, isn't it? If we consistently thought that piracy was wrong, then the discussion would be much more moralizing in its tone - instead of debating the right and wrong of it we could all just complain about how hard it is to stay chaste and how very risque the world has become, how you're being offered pirated goods at every corner. Then we could invent a no-piracy pledge: no consumption before purchase!<br/><br/>(Bear with me, I find this comparison hilarious.)<br/><br/>Entertaining the idea that a creator <i>doesn't</i> have a right to control his work's distribution might seem surprising, but to me it seems that this stems from simple entrenched benefit thinking, brought about by the fact that people have been practically able to control the distribution of their works in the past. There are plentiful examples of similar "rights" that are not usually considered such simply because enforcing them is not feasible, so relying on such rights is just folly. For example, I might argue that I have a right to leave my doors unlocked when I leave house, which is true enough. In fact, this is what I do here in my small town neighbourhood. However, I don't consider this a natural right of any sort, and make demands of the universe to make it so that I can keep my doors unlocked when urbanization kicks in and criminal strangers start popping up. It never quite gets to the level where being the criminal who walks into my house would be accepted by society, but that's just because of how harmful and low-spirited such thievery is. The fact remains that if I leave my doors unlocked, quite a few people would say that one of the persons I should blame for the thievery is myself.<br/><br/>Similarly to the above example, the artist who publishes his work today is living with certain facts of the society. I won't begrudge creators living in this transitional period their harm and pain when they realize that they're being "stolen" from, but at some point we need to man up and accept that this is the new reality: you publish, and the work will be out there, and that's that. A creator who insists on his right to control his product's distribution is like the man who insists on his right to not have his stuff stolen when he doesn't lock his doors - technically he might be right (although I would argue that in case of piracy it would be more seemly and lead to a more friendly society if we accepted piracy as a net good), but his is a most self-centered folly, one that we might not have much sympathy for. He knew what he got into when he published, why is he complaining now that the world works the way it routinely does?<br/><br/>That thievery and locked doors example might not be quite perfect in that it's still an awful thing to do to another person to rob him, no matter how naive he was in the first place, while I'd like to consider piracy a much more positive act in both motivation and outcome. Perhaps a better comparison... it used to be that you could get your marriage annulled if the bride was found to not be a virgin after all; this law is still in force in certain backwaters of the world - do I remember correctly that they had one of these cases in France a while back? Now the world has changed in its more enlightened parts, so we might ask this question: does the groom still have the right to expect virginity of his bride? Or could it be that he's being intolerably conceited, and actually in rather bad taste, were he to raise the issue? The standards in this matter have changed, and I would argue that so they do with creator rights: the private, non-commercial pirate of today is like the non-virgin bride of yesterday, exercising rights that do not yet exist, or that are in the process of becoming. The huffy creator unable to accept that people take the opportunity to engage in this victimless (arguable, I know) crime is like the betrayed husband complaining to the judge and demanding annulment of the marriage and return of the bride price.<br/><br/>Man, I like that comparison. Funny stuff, I'm on a roll despite the worst heat wave Finland has suffered for 70 years.<br/><br/>Anyway, the idea that a creator might not have a copyright after all is no stranger than the idea that a woman is not legally answerable for her virginity. In some societies both of those proposals are true, in some false. It's foolish to think that either would have a moral standing that is somehow over and above the social dynamics of the society. Marrying as a non-virgin is wrong if that sort of thing is societally considered such, and piracy is wrong for the same reason. Change the social rules and you change the morality of the action, for the moral wrong in these cases is not inherent to the act itself but to the expectations others have - by breaking those expectations you're essentially breaking an implicit contract you have with them. Piracy is only wrong if it's somehow playing against the rules, but for those rules to hold, they have to be fair, reasoned and to the benefit of the entire society. As times change and technology among other things brings changes to society the rules need to change for people to continue being beholden to them. In the case of piracy, just like in the case of non-virginity being a marriage annulment excuse, the society has changed and we're just waiting for the new rules to get codified. Might take a while in this case, the rulers of the world have proven rather considerably able to ignore what's happening in the digital world when making their decisions. This'll probably change with the next generation of politicians.<br/><br/>I do recognize that there are people in western societies who consider the virginity of the bride a most important moral factor. This is why moral intuition is not a good argument in societal matters, not by itself: how do you know that you're not querying a crackpot when asking those moral questions? That's a pretty tricky thing. Likewise, what to do when the different parties disagree - one says that non-virginity is a contract matter that needs to be exposed prior to marriage, another one says that the whole idea is attrociously misogynic. The thing to understand about social contract is that when there is this sort of disagreement in the air there is no contract, and consequently no commonly agreed right or wrong. It's still a tragedy if somebody publishes while thinking that there aren't a hundred thousand pirates ready to distribute his work for him, but it's not a wrong, per se - those pirates do not acknowledge your old order of things, they're operating under a new set of rules. This sort of thing isn't going to get resolved without comparing the different roadmaps of the future and having the society institute something. Perhaps some sort of compromise, as we've practically had through the last couple of decades: technically forbidding piracy seems to work pretty well as long as lives of the practitioners are not actually being ruined by active enforcement. I believe that in the long term the entire society will come around, though, unless some powerful new pro-copyright thinking comes up; the tools available at the moment are simply not credible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285019/#Comment_285019" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T17:20:29+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  5:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Posted by Rafu:<br/>\npermission is rude.

Going from idea to well-thought out, written idea is a lot of work; going from written game to a finished PDF or book is a hell of a lot *more* work.  <br/><br/>(And I'll edit this to add here that this is one of the reasons I *don't* create things to sell to other people as a living.  I love the design and thinky parts up front, and I love the writing.  But once I understand the design and see for myself how it works, everything past that is pure tedium.  If I could get paid to think about things and design things and write things, I'd do it.  But I prefer office politics to going from finished idea to sale-worthy product.)  <br/><br/>Two, the people who create things should be compensated for them.  <br/><br/>Three, technology is changing the playing field.  It used to be that copyright was reasonably self-enforcing because it was a lot of work to make copies.  With the advent of xerographic duplication and digital content, making copies is significantly easier. <br/><br/>I think there are some other issues we don't have consensus on.<br/><br/>The current purpose of copyright is unclear.  In the Constitution, the rationale seems to be that granting creators a monopoly period during which they can profit from the work because only they can authorize copying it, but this is done because it encourages creators to make more useful and beautiful works which would eventually pass into the public domain.  More recently, it has been used by corporate interests to maximize profit as much as possible, essentially destroying the public domain, and ensuring that nothing can pass into the public domain until it is put there explicitly.  <br/><br/>We seem to agree that there are some people who are simply not going to purchase the product.  We do not have any consensus on how to respond to this:  some people seem to take a bright-line "all unauthorized copying is wrong" approach, while other people seem to think that if they aren't going to buy the book anyway, it does no harm if they copy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285035/#Comment_285035" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T19:34:07+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  7:34PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2010 7:36PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Fair enough, but in the midst of voicing a strong opinion, the only thing I've asked of others in this thread is that they start with the premise that copying / changing / redistributing a creator's work without permission is wrong.</blockquote>\nThere is nothing morally right that can be done with a cigarette ad in a magazine  except change it, remix it, and redistribute it in ways the owner of the ad would hate.

Not theft like he claims, but it's not an argument I'd use myself, for the reasons Ryan states: we can't know the minds of others, and there's definite financial vested interest for anybody to lie to themselves about "would I have bought that anyway". Luckily, this is definitely a matter that can be researched, so it's just a matter of will and a bit of ingenuity to find out the truth here: just go through enough people and find out whether they're reliable practical judges of themselves in this regard, and you'll have a good sense of how useful "would I buy it" is as an anti-piracy metric. I wouldn't be surprised if there already were some research like this; the results are probably somewhat grey, indicating some moral laxness but also some, perhaps surprising, integrity. Piracy-advocating political activists at least seem to like riding research that indicates that piracy is most common among the people who spend the most money on culture industry anyway.<br/><br/>I'm not personally very interested in the sordidness of humanity in this matter, though. The economic inclinations of pirates are only of interest if you're invested in the economic impact of piracy on old school copyright-based culture industry, and as we remember, I'm really not. It will be interesting to see how selling content will fare in the future, when paying is essentially going to be voluntary, but it's not a crucial issue for me because I'm not trying to convince anybody to change policy on the basis of any imaginations I might have on the matter. Whether pirates are willing to donate money willingly or not does not really change the facts on the ground, so it's not a matter of interest in policy-making. If renovating copyright dependent on just "but pirates will really pay for the things they pirate afterwards", then I wouldn't support the idea, either.<br/><br/>(If I had to guess, by the way, I'd say that the people pinning their hopes on the integrity of pirates are deluded. At this moment in time it's still pretty common for people to at least claim that they pirate just to sample things and buy the ones they'd have "bought anyway", but that seems like text-book transitional behaviour to me; it'll go away if and when piracy becomes more widely accepted and the moral pressure easens. We'll likely still see donations of money to creators and various other flows of commerce in the information age, but they won't be predicated on shame like this current arrangement, but entirely other considerations. The only reason pirates buy the things they pirate today as a matter of principle is because they at some level believe that what they do is wrong; telling yourself that you only pirate things to "check them out" is just a rationalization.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285048/#Comment_285048" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T21:29:33+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  9:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>The problem I have with this is, firstly, my personal feeling is someone willing to download it without paying for it (assuming its a commercially for sale item) is a thief.</blockquote>\nTo be blunt, your personal feeling is wrong, at least legally speaking, as has already been established.  Beyond that, the rest of your argument is based on the premise that unauthorized copying is analogous to theft of physical property.  Unfortunately, you're begging the question: you *assume* that analogy is valid, and so when you reach the end of the argument, you consider it proven.  But as the previous 133 posts should clearly show, the validity of that analogy is one of the things that is in question here.<br/><br/>In particular, if you have a Lamborghini, and I take it, you no longer have the Lamborghini.  But if you have a PDF, and I make a copy of it, you still have the PDF.  Further, the marginal cost of each extra PDF is miniscule.  Your publishing model involves amortizing the development costs among all the copies sold; that model works if you can practically control how many copies are made.  But you can't, and while you do have the option of railing against the march of progress in emotionally charged but logically fallacious posts, you'll probably do much better in the long run if you figure out how to adapt your publishing model to suit a world where copying and distribution are cheap and publishers are increasingly irrelevant except as curators.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

There's really not that much difference between a curious person wanting to see all the tv shows on HBO and the one who's reading through the local library's science fiction shelves alphabetically. Both have an unrestrained passion for the art, and often for the better - we build the future intelligentsia by immersing our youth in unfettered culture to see what sticks and to whom, and we maintain and develop our own, already considerable fields of knowledge and understanding by the same. The institution of public libraries was originally predicated on recognizing that the worst kind of caste differential would develop between people if the ability to learn and educate yourself were limited only to those who could afford it; there really is no difference at all that I can discern between this and what we have in the world wide web, except for the quicker service; you can't even opt out as a content creator from . Although not many are actually massive consumers of culture industry product, among those who are, and thus show a necessary trait for intellectual pursuit, a life without free culture distribution can prove a very real obstacle to self-development.<br/><br/>The above might well be a mind-boggling attitude to some, I do realize. Still, think of it - what <i>is</i> the difference between a public library and the Internet, and why should one have the right to exist and function while the other doesn't? The era of free distribution might lead to something rather beautiful as we're all elevated by everybody's cultural work regardless of financial means of participation. Even if technology requires us to rethink the structure of the culture industry, at least it also seems to be forcing us towards a totally egalitarian cultural situation. Interesting, in the very least, and very possibly positive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285078/#Comment_285078" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T23:53:04+00:00" title="August  9, 2010 11:53PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was about to ask about that - if a public library bought your game and put it on its shelves for, I donno, 300 people to check out, for free, anytime they wanted, would you think that was different than, say, 600,09001234134134314 879318274789134 copying it with their Xerox machines or their torrentamajibs?

Obviously enough the scale matters - historically the effect of libraries has been tolerated due to the perceived benefits despite the clear losses in profits for culture industry, so perhaps it's reasonable to resist this analogy simply because it takes things too far: instead of having 20% of a book's readership consist of library-users have it approach 99%, and it's a quite different thing, obviously. The principle is the same, but perhaps we could look upon libraries not as a matter of principle, but as a matter of charity - the culture industry has charitably acceded to a political compromise that allows some degree of free culture for even the most dispossessed.<br/><br/>Still, the existence of libraries does affect the credibility of the copyright institution. Nowadays it's possible for me to go to the library and read a pdf-published book on their screens. Who on earth benefits from forcing me to go do this in the library instead of simply downloading the book onto my own computer? One would think that it would be a net positive if I used my own computer and left the library's computer to those who don't have workstations of their own. If we accept that I could get a culture product for free from the local library, as is often the case, then it seems just petty to require me to do so instead of getting that same work directly off the Internet.<br/><br/>Lots of shades of grey in this copyright thing, perhaps enough to justify questioning the entire concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285081/#Comment_285081" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T00:17:59+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 12:17AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you argue that the hours of work you put into creating something should be rewarded with money, I'll argue that the money you get for your work shouldn't increase with the length of time your product is on the market.

When it stops serving that goal, it's a bad thing.<br/><br/>In other words, it's a bargain in the social contract.  Society/government gives the author the sole right to make copies; the author gives society/government access on reasonable terms so that he can reap the profits of producing the work.  It only works when both sides hold up their ends of the bargain.  So in my view, once the creator has released the work, he doesn't get to decide what happens to it either -- he has the moral right to be known as the creator of the work, but not to control it entirely.  Sure, the ethical thing is to pay him what he asks, but if he's not asking, or he's asking something unreasonable, he's not complying with his terms of the contract.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285109/#Comment_285109" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T06:26:34+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  6:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Can we all grant to Ryan that it certainly feels like theft, even if it's just legally a tort?

I'd like to know in which of these, if any, <i>would</i> you consider denying a request for such to be "petty and selfish."  I'll stick with game text examples, since we are, after all, on an gaming forum.  And let's assume, in all cases, that I've acquired my original copy of the game text legally.<br/><br/>1) I want to reproduce parts of the text in a new document for reference in play.  For the GM or players.  Maybe new characters sheets, or rules cheat sheets.<br/>2) I want to reproduce parts of the text in a new document, as above, but I also want to share them with strangers on the internet because I think my documents are useful or cool or would otherwise enhance others enjoyment of the game.<br/>3) I only have a PDF of the game text and I want to print out large chunks of it to use as a reference at the table, perhaps because I lack a laptop or e-reader<br/>4) I only have a PDF of the game text and friends I've played the game with or told the game about are interested in reading it more thoroughly, so I want to send them a copy<br/>5) I want to hack the game.  Maybe I want to use its setting with another system, or maybe I want to take apart its system to use for a different purpose.<br/>6) I want to do some kind of art project / collage with the game.  I want to take bits of it, rip them out, and mash them together with chunks from Wraeththu , Nobilis, and passages from the Bible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285132/#Comment_285132" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T07:38:26+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  7:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 7:42AM by fnord3125.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: AdamK</cite>In my book, fair compensation for creative work should be the same as for other work: one time compensation based on hours worked or product created.</blockquote>Like the ransom model, in other words.

In general, copyright law (and rights, as recognized by governments) exists to encourage--not fund--the creation of useful and beautiful works. It's an important distinction. Funding is one kind of encouragement. Faith that one's works cannot be subverted or stolen is another. Copyright is a whole bundle of rights, and the right to derive income from one's work is just a small part of them. If you want to maintain such a narrow view of copyright, that's fine, but there's little use in you and I continuing this discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285169/#Comment_285169" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T09:48:32+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  9:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I'm... on the fence about this assertion.

At least a few times I've bought things<i>specifically</i>because the author was cool enough to<i>give</i>them away for free (Cory Doctorow novels, Jonathan Coulton music, and the Eclipse Phase RPG, for example).</blockquote>\nThat's why I stuck that "as a matter of principle" qualifier into that sentence, actually: while pirates pay authors for many reasons, the only principled reason I've encountered is the one where you pay to make up for having pirated the thing. That's a guilty motivation. There's also other motivations in play when people pay creators, such as becoming really fannish about it and wanting to support the starving artist, but that's not a principle, that's just motivation. When a pirate wants to justify himself, he'll often bring in the idea that he's not "really" causing any financial loss because he'll buy the things that deserve it. That's a principle (applying to his actions in general), and it's also guilty thinking, as the pirate realizes that piracy isn't maintainable as a general principle of the culture industry economy without the money coming from <em>somewhere</em>. So that's where we get this pretty common current justification for piracy, "I only pirate to check out things, and I pay for the ones that truly deserve it in hindsight."<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I'm not personally convinced by the rationalization where I'm just "checking out" a product prior to purchase. The intrigue of the unknown is a major part of the marketing strategy for many of these things, so it's ludicrous to say that it's somehow OK for me to satisfy my curiousity and then only make the purchase if I want long-term ownership of the piece. That's a very arbitrary way of redefining the nature of the product which the author might have made specifically to work with that initial curiousity instead of striving for a permanently intriguing thing. Even if you're just watching that movie once to see if it's worthwhile to buy, you're still very much consuming the product and removing a significant part of the motivation the publisher relies on in convincing you to make the buy. Perhaps this has some slight, very slight credence in roleplaying due to how important a long-term relationship with a game is for a person to truly experience it, but nobody probably would deny that curiousity is still a significant market force in roleplaying as well.<br/><br/>The above might seem contradictory considering that I'm pro-revision on copyright matters, but I'm just trying to see things as they are, not to build an ideological fantasy. I think that the current state of things where piracy has to be justified by elevating the pirate himself into an unilateral judge of who gets paid and who doesn't is pretty screwy and has only evolved to make pirates feel good about themselves. It'd be better if the moral pressure was taken away, allowing people to dispense with this "false consciousness" (heh) and just get on with their cultural interactions. That requires creators developing new methods of commerce, though, something that does not rely on controlling the work's distribution.<br/><br/>Then again, I don't know - perhaps moral pressure is effective as a market device? Some creators seem to report that they get more money out of the piracy machine than it takes by various metrics, and much of that seems to be guilt-money that would likely not be there if the creator gave the work away unfettered by demands of recompense. Perhaps it benefits creators to encourage the development of this "good pirate" archetype where people consider it their moral responsibility to remove the files after viewing unless they like it enough to buy it, or however this attitude might be best expressed. Many financial systems in the world (most of them charities) work almost purely by moral means, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285171/#Comment_285171" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T09:49:47+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  9:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Still, think of it - what<i>is</i>the difference between a public library and the Internet, and why should one have the right to exist and function while the other doesn't?</blockquote>\nNo one is saying that the Internet does have the right to exist and function. It's a medium. It exists. People use it for good and bad. I'm not calling for shutting down the Internet, for god's sake. I am calling for people to shame certain behavior that was illegal and (I believe) immoral (in a small way--I'm not comparing it to murder, people) before the advent of file sharing. Shame it, or at the very least stop supporting it.<br/><br/>Your public library analogy has flaws I could drive a Lamborghini through. Or a Lancia Stratos. Libraries buy their books. As delegates of the government, of the people, they pay the author and then share the books with a reasonably limited number of people in a limited way (two weeks, or only on the premises in the case of ebooks). I don't think these limits are ridiculous at all. These limits preserve the author's copyright as much as possible. In other words, the library is carefully exercising Fair Use. If a library started printing and binding copies of my PDF and giving them away to thousands of patrons, I'd think they'd overstepped the bounds of Fair Use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It is, however, a tort; that is, grounds for a civil lawsuit, just as depriving someone of their Freedom of Speech is a civil offense, not a criminal one. I'm generally on your side here, but you're not helping your case by misrepresenting the law. <br/><br/>In any case, folks like AdamK and Eero and Rafu are making claims that disregard the legal or moral status of certain parts of copyright, so resting on legal authority won't make your case to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285198/#Comment_285198" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T10:38:17+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>Copyright violation is against the law...hence why there is a law.

You seem to be arguing that the law is inherently moral and ethical.  When Richard and Mildred Loving, married in Washington, DC, were arrested in Virginia for sleeping in the same bed, they were little better than thieves.  No?  What they were doing was against Virginia law.  And part of what we're discussing here is the relationship between the law, ethics, and technology, and so while it's perfectly clear that unauthorized copying is likely to be against the law, it does not follow from that that unauthorized copying is *wrong*, and so saying, "Duh, it's the law, stupid!", while it may be true, is completely irrelevant.<br/><br/>And the difference is that the right to life is a natural right, while copyright is not -- rather, it's a limited monopoly granted to encourage people to create things.  Further, the claim that making a copy *inherently* and *necessarily* deprives someone of something in the same way that murder deprives someone of life is a completely unfounded leap.  <br/><br/>Repeating your argument over and over and over again, especially when it's been explained to you each time you've made it that even if it weren't full of fallacies, it depends on premises that aren't universally agreed upon, is not going to convince anyone but yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285200/#Comment_285200" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T10:41:23+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:41AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Christopher Weeks Wrote<br/>\n<br/>\nWeird.

This seems non-contentious to me despite a certain grey area as regards private copying and distribution (allowed by the Finnish law, for example), as those grey areas certainly don't apply to the large-scale distribution networks that exist today internationally.<br/><br/>This part of the discussion is so utterly obvious that I don't really have anything more to say about it. The real conundrum with piracy is not whether it's illegal, but whether it <i>should</i> be. That's a different order of issue, and one where we can't rely on the law or precedent to lead the way. If we justify the existence of anti-piracy laws with the fact that there are anti-piracy laws, then our legal system is now and forevermore in stasis: no law can ever be changed, for the existence of that law justifies its own existence. That's textbook circular reasoning.<br/><br/>The real issue we're discussing, it seems to me, is whether copyright is <b>moral</b> and <b>practical</b>. Adam has been arguing that it is moral while I've been arguing that while it might be moral, it's not an absolute moral issue, and may therefore be set aside for the good of all when it becomes impractical to enforce without undue compromises in other areas of life. In reference to Joshua, I wouldn't characterize this discussion as a debate so much as a conversation, we've been telling each other how we think about this matter. Adam's point, as I understand it, is that he has a strong moral intuition about copyright being right, so much so that he finds it mind-boggling that we don't share this conviction. I've been sort of trying to cast doubt upon this intuition with a variety of rhetorics because to me it seems like an entrenched belief that has no basis once you question it thoroughly, but well, we know how well that sort of thing works in real life <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>I do agree with Ryan's insight that it shows poor form for society to act in bad faith regarding creators who published their work imagining that they might benefit off it instead of having the work be pirated every which way. They were betrayed by their own ignorance and the society around them, which mislead them into thinking that their work would be protected, when in fact it is not. I wrote about this earlier in the thread: the real tragedy of piracy is that creators have been and still are utterly unprepared for the reality of digital distribution, which causes anger and shame and a general questioning of the moral nature of the universe. It feels a lot like theft or a similar violation, I'm sure. It's a further tragedy when the myth of copyright is deliberately upheld to school new creators into believing in rights that exist only on paper, and it becomes even more tragic when people start following the idea that copyright needs to be saved, leading into actual deeds of aggression towards the pirate networks in a futile attempt to change the world back into the way it was. (I'm using the word "futile" deliberately here: so far all solutions for the piracy problem have been utterly ineffective, while the potentially effective hypothetical solutions have been awful and authoritarian. This is the basis for my stance on this matter.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285212/#Comment_285212" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T10:57:18+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:57AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Of course it does, but how do you determine intent?

I'd correct points from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> forward to clarify that I do not see any public right to possession of creative works as a matter of natural right, but only a practical situation that makes it impossible to distribute anything without using free distribution models or having somebody else do that for you. This in turn implies that points 4-7 are not moral dictums for me, but practical statements of fact: those are in reality things people can do, and there's little that we should be doing to stop them, because all cures I've seen proposed are worse than the disease. Therefore it's better to catch the wave and adapt to the situation, as it's only going to get worse for old-style copyright industry: more people will become habitual pirates, what anti-piracy measures are tried will be more routinely cracked and any legal cases will only become more spectacular, unjust and controversial when people are dragged from their homes to answer for crimes that all neighbours very well know to be theirs as well.<br/><br/>So it's not "should have" as you say in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, but "do factually have". The only moral component of my argument is that unless somebody can point to a method of piracy-prevention that doesn't infringe on traditional personal freedoms of speech and privacy, and the freedom of the Internet, then I can't in good conscience support copyright in its modern form any longer. A system that only punishes the law-abiding by having them shoulder the entire financial burden of the culture industry is not going to last long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285228/#Comment_285228" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T11:20:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 11:20AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not quite, at least in my case, Adam - you're rather more extreme than I am. <br/><br/>First, the ethical argument.<br/><br/>1.  Creators do not have the inherent right to control distribution of their work.  They do have the right to be recognized as creator of the work, and to designate authoritative versions of their work.<br/>2.  (same) Copyright is a privilege granted to creators by governments to encourage them to create things.<br/>3.  That privilege is balanced against the public's right to possess creative works.<br/>4.  In exchange for that privilege of monopoly protection, creators have a duty to make their work available for a reasonable price.<br/>5.  When the creator is no longer making the work available for a reasonable price -- such as when a book goes out of print -- then the privilege of monopoly protection no longer applies.<br/>6.  Extending, changing, manipulating, copied into any medium, all fine -- as long as the contributions are recognized.  <br/>7.  People can copy however they like, but reasonable compensation, preferably in line with what the author requests, is ethically required. <br/>8.  All of this applies to *creators* -- not warehouse staff, middlemen, publishers, whatever.  <br/><br/>Now, the pragmatic argument.<br/><br/>1.  Technology makes it possible and easy for people to do things that are not ethical, even by the standards I outlined above.<br/>2.  Enacting laws to work against the progress of technology is a fool's game. <br/>3.  The same technological changes that make unauthorized copying easy make authorized copying easy.<br/>4.  In the long term, creators who work with technology rather than against it will benefit.  <br/>5.  In the long run, middlemen who do not add value will cease to exist. <br/><br/>I mean, to take an example: it is possible for someone, right this minute, to send $18 to Vincent Baker, and within a day, have a shiny PDF of Apocalypse World in my hands -- and the marginal cost of that PDF to him is measured in pennies.  I have no idea what PayPal charges him for fees, so we'll say he makes $15 in profit from that sale.  What if things were like they were twenty years ago?  Well, suppose I wanted to buy his book for $28, which is what he charges now for print+pdf.  $14 of that would have gone to the store; $7 to the warehouse and distributor.  $2-3 to produce the book leaves him with a profit of $4-$5.  <br/><br/>So, in terms of remuneration to the creator, he's doing a *lot* better than he was before.  And if I give the PDF to two other people, he's breaking even.  Now, if I give the PDF to two other people who have ethics similar to myself, and they like it, that's two more sales for him that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't given out the PDF.

What I'm describing isn't reality just a suggested way of selling creative products. It's a counterpoint to today's publishing model and copyright legislation and thus could only work if the majority or at least an easily visible minority of publishing was made that way.<br/><br/>As you have noted, it doesn't work just yet, and I'm not encouraging anyone who's buying food from selling games to try making their money this way.

You never addressed the original post where I made that argument, nor the follow-up posts where I referred back to it.</blockquote>\nI thought I did - this was the part with the Ku Klux Klan, right? I argued that while there is some truth to the idea that you need to be able to control the medium to control the message, much of this effect is actually directly caused by the existence of that power of control. Remove an author's copyright and you also remove any audience expectation that the author would control it, obviously enough. This is not to say that it's not possible to paint a creator in negative light once creator rights are relaxed, but that seems to me like a price that has to be paid, again - it's not convincing me that the creator's right to have his work remain pristine is more important than the ability people have today to publish things anonymously and without censorship. Those two rights are polar opposites in the digital world, as the only way to enforce Adam's right to not get associated with Ku Klux Klan is to establish effective controls that consistently prevent people from publishing such tripe.<br/><br/>But yes, you're right in that you have certainly argued for your position. I didn't want to imply that you didn't, I just summarized that the basis of your argument is that you find creator rights so very valuable that they should not be given up in the face of the practical difficulties. This mirrors my own argument - perhaps we should talk about those practical steps now to find out what it is, exactly, that I'm finding impossible in enforcing copyright? Seems like that's in the center of this.<br/><br/>In any case, no barbs were intended, and it's nothing personal to you that rhetorics don't convince people. I have fun trying to explain the way I see this issue in various ways (that virginity comparison is still gold), but it remains a fact that people don't change their opinions on worldview stuff like this on the strength of some Internet rhetoric. We'll have to give it time and look at the matter fresh, and perhaps one of us finds later on that he's actually convinced by something that is being said in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285233/#Comment_285233" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T11:27:10+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 11:27AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            fnord3125 wrote,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;1) I want to reproduce parts of the text in a new document for reference in play.

They didn't pay us for what they sold in the agreed-upon territory either, but we were definitely harmed to the tune of over a million dollars, and the company perished.  We got a judgment of $1.6 million dollars but didn't have the money to enforce it.  Bottom line is, this had real consequences for us, our families, and our investors.  I saw not a dime for eighteen months of work.<br/><br/>Fiction writers now are very uneasy about eBook proliferation.  The question ultimately is, how much of the revenue will find its way back to the author?  We don't have the musician's option of performing concerts or shows.  Patronage might be an answer, but my experience is that most people who download files for free don't actually care to pay.  Sorry, but my personal experience with friends who live on BitTorrent is that they pretty much just don't want to pay for anything.  While that may be a natural impulse, it's still unethical.  We're not talking about grabbing copies of OOP material, which is in my mind the only justification that approaches the ethical.<br/><br/>Doctorow may be making enough to live off his writing (I don't know if he actually is), but I don't know any other writers seeing enough sales from eBooks to support them as writers.  The folks I'm talking to--widely published and making a full-time living today off dead tree publication--aren't reporting electronic sales as anything more than a blip, not even a promising trend.  I'm highly skeptical that living on the long tail will enable more than a tiny percentage of writers to earn nontrivial income.<br/><br/>I'm reading a lot of high-minded, cogent arguments about our brave new digital world, and though from a practical standpoint I agree the genie is out of the bottle and we'll have to adapt as a practical matter.  On the other hand, I think these claims ignore the very real consequences piracy can have on creators.  It may be we're headed for a world where all art becomes a hobby, except where the creator is employed by a corporation financially able to leverage a mass-distribution and marketing channel.  I think there's value in having creators able to make an independent living off their own work.  I don't view this as entitlement.  If I'm not going to be paid for my work, I won't put the massive effort out to create.  I may do some personal stuff or submit to hobby press to scratch my creative itch, but that's it.  If you're a small press hobby publisher, piracy may not hurt you much, since you know going in you're going to sell a small number of copies, and you're probably directing your effort toward a distinct demographic that will buy X number of copies anyway.<br/><br/>For me, the notion that I could bust my ass for a year or two, sell my book on a royalty agreement, then have it copied and distributed without compensation is offensive.  While it may not technically rise to the legal definition of theft, I nevertheless feel victimized.  It feels like the moral equivalent of theft.  Sure, it's not the same level of intrusion as violation of your home, but the creative work is your baby, and if it's copied without permission, it's essentially a theft of my time and effort.  If I choose to release my work for free, that's one thing.  If I don't, then an unauthorized and uncompensated copy constitutes, in my view, a parasitic taking.  It ignores the labor that went into the book.  It ignores the fact that the limit on copyright is part of the creator's choice to control the supply of the product that hits the market.  It potentially impacts my income and my ability to feed my family using my hard-won professional skill.  I can still sell my writing as a service, just not as a good.  I suspect this is the future for professional creative writing.<br/><br/>If electronic copies are OK across the board, what about taking a book and making a movie out of it?  How should copyright apply in that instance?  Does an author have copyright in one instance but not the other?  Note that I'm not talking about copies for personal use.  I'm saying that a digital copy of a current for-sale work distributed without permission has a commercial impact by affecting the supply and demand for my work and is therefore a taking, the moral equivalent of theft.  As I said, the only possible exception might be for OOP work that's no longer commercially available (I don't count inflated eBay offerings as "commercially available").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285304/#Comment_285304" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T15:55:41+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  3:55PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 5:51PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>The folks I'm talking to--widely published and making a full-time living today off dead tree publication--aren't reporting electronic sales as anything more than a blip, not even a promising trend.

How should copyright apply in that instance?</blockquote>\nThere's a world of difference between monitoring a movie studio and monitoring a hundred million anonymous Internet users. This is why I don't expect the commercial control facet of copyright to disappear - creators will probably retain their commercial monopoly on their own work in the future to the same degree that they do today, as it's ultimately relatively easy to track down any significant commercial activity, such as the making and distribution of a movie. The movie-maker can't make his movie anonymously and distribute it anonymously if he's to make money off it, so he's going to get caught just the same as ever.<br/><br/>Of course even if you're the only one who has the legal right to sell your work and authorize spin-off products, free distribution will still kill the actual product dead as a market entity, at least compared to the current situation. Is the culture industry we have today bloated, or is it prosperous? Will we be better off when only one in a hundred of today's culture industry professionals work in this industry? Or will it be a dark age of civilization? Sure will be interesting to find out. On the one hand it's easy to imagine how dull life would be without 200 new Hollywood movies per year, but on the other hand we already have so much, culturally, that I'm a bit hesitant to claim that I need those 200 new movies every year to develop as a human being and enjoy my quality of life. There's already so much culture out there that I'll never be able to sample everything, so just measuring our prosperity by the amount of money poured into the culture industry seems wrong.<br/><br/>We as creators have an immense self-interest in the copyright law, which makes us all somewhat suspect as commentators on the matter. It's like asking car dealers to do your city planning. Ultimately I see the inability to imagine a world without copyright as entitlement; perhaps it is justified if your work truly is so valuable and indispensable. The fact remains, though, that the rest of the society is not responsible for providing a single author a living wage, and when enforcing copyright becomes unfeasible, the society is no more responsible for saving the culture industry than it was for saving the horse coach business when cars were invented. We need to prove ourselves viable by our own actions, as it is untenable to ask the state to enforce conditions that make our old ways possible indefinitely. If we can't make our horse fly (to compete with that autocar from the last simile), then we deserve our whole field of endeavour to shrink into a cottage industry and a mere hobby. If new cultural work is truly requisited by society, the money for it will be there one way or another even with the omnipresent Internet. Sucks for us, but let's not get in the way of progress - that never ends well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285310/#Comment_285310" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T17:04:20+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  5:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I don't disagree with the practical arguments you're advancing, and I appreciate your thoughtful, patient analysis.  I'm not arguing  society is responsible for offering authors or anyone else a living wage.  I am saying that we're at a crux where choices about policy and law can have an impact.  I think copyright is valuable as a commercial encouragement for creators, and I am skeptical that we should simply dispense with it.  Even open source software operates under license constraints that can bring tangible consequences where violation is discovered.  Enforcement may be difficult and even scattershot, but I think we can find a reasonable enforcement model that provides some protection to creators without automatically requiring resort to authoritarian means.  Note that I'm not arguing for unlimited copyright.  From a policy standpoint, I suppose my take has congruency to demands for fair trade or reasonable protectionism.  Just because something is possible doesn't make it inevitable or optimal.  It's a fair trade in some ways.  If someone chooses to download an unauthorized file, he or she is presumably accepting the risk of being hit with draconian penalties.  That risk constitutes a non-monetary price of sorts.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the actual long-term answer will likely be writers riding the long tail, pushed along by viral marketing efforts.  Publishers may find a niche here for helping produce and market certain works.  I suspect quality will drop inasmuchas editors play a huge role in manuscript quality.  Books will probably split between self-publishing sources like Lulu and limited hard-copy publications for a few heavily promoted books that fall into a best-seller category, much as the music industry puts out heavily promoted pop bands du jour.  These will be pushed as artifacts ahead of ebook release.  Bookstores that sell new books are likely to go the way of the dinosaur.  Used bookstores will hang on longer, maybe a few decades.  Most authors will probably follow the shareware model for works sold as goods.  Aside from the few "pop band" discoveries, other creative writers will work off a hobby model, and I don't think the particular medium is as adaptable as music.  There may be a small market for crafty authors who produce unique artifacts like handmade book covers, special paper, additional maps, etc.<br/><br/>I view anti-piracy tech measures as reasonable to a point.  They're much like car locks in that they're meant to keep out the casual, opportunistic thief, but not the pro.  It's less about pursuing the illusion of absolute enforceability and more about putting up enough of a hurdle to discourage folks from casual copying.  That said, this approach is doomed.  There really isn't anything that can't be cracked absent Brobdingnagian measures that compromise the delivery of the work itself (by crushing it with encryption code, for example).<br/><br/>Accounting for Taste, you're right that the publishing industry doesn't push much income at writers, at least mid-list or lower.  You're also right in pointing out that the current model has shortcomings.  The publishing industry has been in a reconfiguration for at least a decade, beset by competition with other media and increasing internet proliferation.  Books are just not as popular.  At the same time, I suspect the mid-list will vanish entirely in the new paradigm, and book quality generally will suffer.  Producing books does actually take a lot of effort and cost.  The model is pretty well tracked.  I don't see the onrushing train of digital books pushing more income to writers, though.  I think overall the opposite will happen.  Many pro writers you see on the shelves are already putting out books around their day jobs.  These folks might still write, but they sure won't make more.<br/><br/>Libraries don't fuck them over, nor do used book stores.  There's still a limit on supply.  Libraries buy books, sometimes several copies of one book.  Used bookstores traffick in previously sold copies.  The continued presence of a transferable artifact usable by one person at a time isn't fucking anyone over.  I don't think this argument touches the same issues as digital copying, and no author I'm aware of has a problem with used bookstores or libraries.  In many ways, libraries are a great example of free distribution with some revenue going back to the writer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285312/#Comment_285312" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T17:23:40+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  5:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the fact that libraries are now loaning eBooks affect your view on them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285316/#Comment_285316" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T17:46:53+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  5:46PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have uninformed opinions on this subject that no one wants or needs to hear, but the peripheral topic of libraries as middle-men who may or may not be fucking over artists interests me.<br/><br/>One of forty-two reasons libraries and librarians rock is that they sometimes act as filtering middle-men reviewers/critics/purveyors of quality above and beyond what publishers have decided to put an advertising budget behind.  I love all the stories about small books, especially children or YA books that get a huge word-of-mouth bump from libraries.  Books of quality and artistic merit that no one might have noticed had it not been for a librarian and a few of their professional associates (and a few of their professional associates, etc.) who found it and shared it via reading hours or similar.

On the other hand, libraries lend DVDs already, but not everyone bothers to copy them, so I would say no, it doesn't affect my opinion.  I'm not talking about zero tolerance, but about a practical boundary that protects the creator's investment of blood and sweat.<br/><br/>The issue boils down to a huge difference between the time and effort required to make a work and the time and effort to copy and distribute the digital version.<br/><br/>There's a bit of a lemmings to the sea effect going on here where people copy because they can, and the result is that financial structures that support free expression are being destroyed, while the financial structures that support oppression remain untouched.  Copyright arguably allowed and encouraged distribution of rock and roll during a period where the prevailing power structure deemed it immoral, because copyright supported an economic model that in turn motivated the spread of this new style of music.  Writing a good novel or putting together a solid album or painting a brilliant picture takes months or years of real effort and intellectual and artistic capital.  If we don't have economic structures in place to support artists and protect their investment, I think society will lose out.  As I said above, I expect we are heading to a new model regardless, and we'll have to live with it.  But the mid-list authors will be gone, or lost in an ocean of fanfic quality crap.<br/><br/><i>Edited to add:  I am not in agreement with <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/08/10/216252/FBI-Prioritizes-Copyright-Over-Missing-Persons" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which is another side effect of pushing too hard against the tide.

I want to clarify - I'm not arguing against you, I'm examining different facets of the issue. Your projections about the future seem rather reasonable; something like that is probably what's in store.<br/><br/>The important ray of hope for the culture industry in all this is that the fraction of the money going directly to the substantial creator himself will increase due to many different factors involved: not only will the material cost of publication be all but zero once everybody moves to digital media in whatever field of culture one operates, but the reduced competition brought about by free distribution (and less committed artists escaping the market, essentially) will mean that a smaller fraction of the income will go to marketing and other logistic expenses. I'd like to visionarize that the professional creator of the future will subsist on a larger piece of a smaller pie in all regards, while the consumer will perhaps come to appreciate the artist more without the marketing machine that shapes our current relationship to culture. Just imagine how it will influence the way you select the music you listen once there is no corporate interest constantly communicating to you about what is new and what is hot; that's probably where we're going in the digital culture world, as nobody has the money for nearly the current level of - one would like to say artificial - competition.<br/><br/>What will ultimately kill copy protection is the fact that once a protection has been cracked, it's relatively trivial to transform the digital data into a non-protected package. At that point the consumer can select between buying a protected version or downloading a non-protected one, which means that the only people ever interacting with the copy protection measures are those who buy their products. It's a remarkably desperate proposition to try to protect high-profile stuff with copy protection measures, as it's not the occasional Sunday pirate that your protection has to keep out, but rather the very best the world has to offer - and once that guy cracks the work he's quick to distribute the result. It's a rather daunting task to invent a copy-protection measure that'll hold even months before being routinely crackable.<br/><br/>There is some light at the end of the tunnel for the pro-copyright crowd as regards technical means of preventing piracy, though: one of the most credible proposals I've heard is to simply lock the everyday computer user into a certain set of verified, secure file formats that can be tracked and certified. The file format alone is not sufficient, as anybody can then just skip using data in that format as is the case with various DRM measures now; for this reason it's imperative to get the hardware and software producers to cooperate in creating computers that simply refuse to run any media software that is not certified as hamstrung (unable to run open media file formats, that is). On a theoretical level this sort of thing can reach a very high level of security, as the user of the computer would be prevented on a hardware level from running any software from unknown sources, thereby effectively preventing them from using third-party media solutions. I seem to remember that this is not just theory anymore, either... ah, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing" rel="nofollow">Trusted Computing</a>. Great stuff, thrilling to imagine as a widely adopted solution.<br/><br/>The above sort of solutions are what I mean when I say that the cure is worse than the disease. How do you convince somebody to trade their computer for a model that only runs software certified by the manufacturer? I suppose it's possible, but the way to that is essentially to ban the production of non-controlled computers and prosecute any attempts at directly modifying the hardware to bypass the certification architecture. Furthermore, content creators who actually need to be able to create open and modifiable files as part of their workflow, what about them - they'll need to use software that forcibly watermarks anything they make for tracking purposes, I suppose. And of course anybody wanting to create computer hardware or software would have to get licensed to do so. This is pretty hardcore shit by my measure, considering the various personal freedoms that need to be at least endangered to make it work, and the need to transform the entire computer industry into an intimately state-controlled endeavour.<br/><br/>(In case it's not clear, the reason for why this sort of piracy-prevention would need to be ubiquitous is that if it's voluntary, then only the law-abiding amateurs will buy a "trusted" computer platform. The nerds who actually know what they're doing with a computer will continue using neutral computing solutions. Might still curb some piracy, at least as long as it takes for the mainstream audience to realize that the computers sold to them are intentionally impaired and worse in actual use than the open platforms.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285330/#Comment_285330" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T18:32:43+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  6:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>Does the fact that libraries are now loaning eBooks affect your view on them?</blockquote>\nSome random internet checking suggests that libraries have only a certain number of copies of eBooks and you have to check them out like normal books. If the copies are checked out already, you can put a hold on the book like normal, and wait till it's released. <br/><br/>The main differences between eBook lending and normal book lending, as far as I can tell, are that eBooks just revert back to the library at the end of the lending period (you don't "return" them) and you're expected to delete the digital copy you have like a good little borrower (there's no practical way for them to delete it for you). In my mind, this is only a little different than letting you photocopy the book (which they really don't do, either, but it happens).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285333/#Comment_285333" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T18:45:19+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  6:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 6:56PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's an "...And You" question for the crowd:  do you feel like having a digital copy of something is better, or worse, or exactly the same as having the physical object that was copied?<br/><br/>In other words:  is a directory of mp3s the same to you as a CD?

Oh, and newspapers - those I read on paper still, mostly because they come to me on paper.<br/><br/>My disdain for the physical format is strong in all cases where I've switched to full digital; I don't like caring for material property in general, and if I need to choose between maintaining my gardening toolshed or my CD collection, it's the latter that I'm going to throw away to not have to worry about it. When I need to use physical media in work-related contexts, such as this weird karaoke machine maintenance sideline I've been thrust into lately, my strategy whenever possible is to copy the material over onto general-purpose digital media instead of juggling the original disks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285350/#Comment_285350" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T20:16:52+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  8:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Digital, I suppose.

May not be possible with books, though the format may make copying much more challenging, but it would likely work with movies.

You keep books indefinitely (or maybe you don't, maybe you sell most of them or give them away to friends when you're done, and only keep a few), but you probably always toss the newspapers in the recycling bin the next day.  How would you treat a movie you downloaded?  Would you archive it and keep it in case you ever wanted to see it again at some point, or would you just delete it after you'd watched it once?<br/><br/>More importantly for the people wrangling with the whole selling-creative-works-in-the-world-of-file-sharing problem, what role does how much you paid for the file play in that decision to keep something or throw it away?  Or to flip the question a bit, what price would be too high for a file that you didn't get to keep indefinitely?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285354/#Comment_285354" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T20:37:04+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  8:37PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>So, here's an "...And You" question for the crowd:  do you feel like having a digital copy of something is better, or worse, or exactly the same as having the physical object that was copied?<br/><br/>In other words:  is a directory of mp3s the same to you as a CD?

AVIs are the same way.<br/><br/>PDFs, on the other hand... I <i>hate</i> PDFs. Some day in the distant future when they make a e-book reader I can safely toss in my back pocket and take to the beach, read in the bathtub, spill beer on, accidentally leave out in the rain, use as improvised coaster, or kill a bug with I'll change my opinion, but for now I see them as as hideous undead mockeries of real books.<br/><br/>Now, I still <i>buy</i> plenty of PDFs. You can't beat the convenience of hearing about a cool new game at 3am and being able to get your very own copy ten minutes later. But my joy in reading something new is always tempered by the feeling that I'm constantly beating my head against the medium. And I wouldn't even <i>think</i> of trying to do something as page-flip-intensive as playing a game with a PDF.<br/><br/>I also <i>illegally download</i> PDFs -- you can't beat the convenience of hearing about a cool new game at 3am and being able to thumb through it at the bookstore to see if you're interested in buying it -- only it's a <i>magic</i> bookstore that exists in your house, has everything in stock, is open at 3 am, and doesn't care if you're wearing pants. Usually I end up deleting the file half an hour later after looking through it and deciding it's not for me, just like most of the times I thumb through an RPG book at the bookstore I end up putting it back on the shelf after deciding I won't get enough use out of it to justify the cover price. And I wouldn't even <i>think</i> about doing something as dickish as actually <i>playing a game</i> I didn't legitimately own. Especially considering how ridiculously cheap of a hobby playing roleplaying games* is.<br/><br/>(*As distinguished from often-related and vastly more expensive hobby of <i>collecting</i> roleplaying

comfortable saying that's any good either, since it doesn't sit right with me.  This would be a structure that only lets you access the material on a server via a secure internet connection in (potentially) a locked format you can't copy onto your client.  May not be possible with books, though the format may make copying much more challenging, but it would likely work with movies.  There's been some talk about doing this with applications, so that everything resides only server-side.</blockquote>\nThe problem here is that unless the receiving computer is also controlled by the distributor, it's relatively simple to route the data into a permanent file - in fact, it's theoretically impossible to have a file format that can be played but can't be copied without limiting the file only to certified playback devices, as the copying can always happen at the output end even if nowhere else. The very crudest way of making such a copy of a DRM'd movie would be to set up a camera in front of your tv and tape whatever is shown; a ridiculously primitive solution, of course, but illustrative of the theoretical problem of creating a truly closed file format that is still able to be used. Not trivial to crack a good closed format of course, and I couldn't do it myself at the drop of a hat, but it's sufficient for one person to be able to do if they also decide to make the file available to others. That's the thing about piracy in action, consistent DRM across all copies of the work only works to prevent people from making personal copies; it does nothing to prevent them from downloading the same thing off the Internet from somebody who cracked it for them. In this regard all the nuances of DRM technology are irrelevant to the pirate end-user, he's just enjoying the cracked fruits of somebody else's ingenuity anyway.<br/><br/>Computer programs, incidentally, are a thing that can apparently be effectively or near-effectively secured, especially in a could-computing set-up. This is because the program itself is not its output, which the case is with static entertainment; you can't "record" a computer program simply by recording what it outputs on your screen. Thus getting a copy of a program that runs on a server somewhere instead of just getting hold of its interface and output would require getting onto that server somehow, which is a different order of computer problem altogether, and one without any ready-made answers. Perhaps video games are going to get a massive lift as the last commercially viable form of culture industry once the fight against piracy is abandoned; everybody will be playing them when Disney puts their marketing machine on it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285362/#Comment_285362" name="Item_202" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T21:35:44+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  9:35PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 9:36PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DMGnome</cite>What I want to know is, how do you react to file sharing? Do you do it? If so, do you have any limitations you set for yourself? Those of you who create, whether you write games or books or music or what-have-you: how does file sharing affect what you do? Do you expect people to pirate your creations? Do you lower your prices? Raise them? Give away your stuff for free?<br/><br/>Of course, I'm not perfect. I have, on occasion, downloaded things which I could have gotten legally without too much trouble. I find it much easier to demonize corporate entities than independent publishers, so I'm much more likely to pirate from an enormous corporation than from a small independent game designer. What about you?</blockquote>\nI'm not a creator, so that part of the question doesn't apply to me. If I were, and I was creating work I expected to be compensated for, I'd want anyone who stole it prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, just like when someone thinks it's funny to walk out of my store with a book slipped in their trenchcoat.<br/><br/>For my part, I have never used file sharing, and don't expect I ever will. In my mind, it's the same thing as walking into a shop and walking out with merchandise you didn't pay for.<br/><br/>I find the rationalization that it's better to take food off the table of someone working full-time at Microsoft or WotC somehow "more ethical" than taking food off the table of a small press creator who doesn't actually make a full-time living off that work bizarre. Stealing is stealing. I <i>know </i>many people who work at those so-called 'corporate entities', and using the market cap of their employers as a self-serving justification for my poor impulse control is grossly disingenuous.<br/><br/>I don't see any difference for out-of-print or hard-to-find work. My stealing it is still entirely a self-serving act that I know to be illegal. I want it yeah, but there's a lot of things in life I want that I know to be wrong, or illegal, and as a result, I don't get them. Shit, I don't even own any PORN I haven't paid the copyright holders for.<br/><br/>But I also know that all psychologists will tell you that the likelihood of a person to commit a crime is not the severity of the punishment, or even who it affects, but the likelihood of getting caught. As long as it's so EASY to steal other people's intellectual property and get away with it, people will do it because they want it and it's easy, and they're selfish, and make up whatever justification makes sense that week (or is fashionable amongst the 'pirates') afterward.<br/><br/>-Jim Crocker de la Mancha                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285364/#Comment_285364" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T21:46:06+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  9:46PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>I mean, to take an example: it is possible for someone, right this minute, to send $18 to Vincent Baker, and within a day, have a shiny PDF of Apocalypse World in my hands -- and the marginal cost of that PDF to him is measured in pennies.</blockquote>\nAssuming you consider the time, labor, and cost he put into creating it and the infrastructure required to get it to you to be worthless, sure.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285365/#Comment_285365" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T22:03:50+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:03PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>Fiction writers now are very uneasy about eBook proliferation.

I'm presuming that the media producer in this scenario isn't railing against the fact that their media is freely available on the internet. <br/><br/>Many webcomics creators and other web media creators already put Paypal Donation buttons on their websites for consumers to donate whatever they feel is a fair value.

The sunk cost of Apocalypse World probably comes to hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.  The marginal cost of one more PDF copy, however, is pennies.<br/><br/>The point of the concrete example, though, was *not* "the marginal cost of AW PDFs is pennies, so he should sell them for a lot less."  No, it's that $18 for a PDF gives him considerably more profit per copy sold than he gets under the traditional author-publisher-distributor-retailer system.  Suppose we fix the sunk cost of AW at $50,000.  How many PDFs does he need to sell, in the neighborhood of $15 profit on each sale, to recoup that?  Under the model in place twenty years ago, how many books would he have needed to sell in the traditional model, in the neighborhood of $3-4 profit on each sale, to recoup that?  (And that's even assuming he could have found a publisher, that the distributors would have ordered the game, that the retail stores would have stocked it....)<br/><br/>The same developments in technology that make it possible for AW to be so easily obtained on file sharing networks *also* make it possible for AW to be so easily obtained legitimately, and also funnel a great deal of the profits straight to the creator rather than to middlemen.  Twenty years ago?  Merchant accounts for credit card processing.  Today?  PayPal accounts.  The changes that make the copying possible *also* make your PayPal account, for beer money or bill-paying money, possible. <br/><br/>This is the reason that (as another concrete example) Steve Jackson Games is moving so much of their GURPS line to PDFs.  The cost of developing the content in that PDF is exactly the same -- but there are no manufacturing or warehousing costs and no up-front investment in inventory.  And the marginal profit is substantially higher, since instead of involving an author, a publisher, a distributor, a retailer, and a purchaser, the process involves the author, the publisher, and the purchaser.  This means that a product with an order of magnitude *smaller* sales figures can be *more* profitable because it is digital and not text.  <br/><br/>It also ignores one of the very concrete examples I gave.  Within the past month, I gave an unauthorized copy of In A Wicked Age to a friend so she could read it, *and she bought a copy.*  I also gave an unauthorized copy of Remember Tomorrow to a friend so he could read it after having played a convention game, *and he bought a copy*.  This also was not possible 20 years ago.  <br/><br/>And, honestly, we're still in the middle of the changes.  Portable readers are getting better and cheaper.  I already buy things both in print and PDF versions because there are situations in which each is more convenient; but I can see a day coming when the main reason I buy a print book is nostalgia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

And, certainly, this is often true. On the other hand, it also (and, I'd guess, <i>much</i> more often) isn't. The problem is that the "piracy" == "creator harm" equation only holds if the pirate would otherwise have paid for the work. The likelihood that the average pirate who torrents, say, the entire library of <i>Shadowrun</i> products would have otherwise paid for every single item in that library seems vanishingly small. Conversely, it's pretty likely that he would have paid for <i>some</i> of them. So, it may be that the <i>entire</i> download is unethical, but only <i>some</i> of that download is <i>actually</i> causing real "harm". (Naturally, no legal system is equipped to deal with nebulous things like what someone might have done in some alternate universe, so this obviously isn't a <i>legal</i> point, or approach.)<br/><br/>To make the whole thing even more ridiculous, consider what happens if the situation is exactly the same, except what is being pirated isn't a creative work, but rather a tangible, consumable object, such as an apple. That is, suppose the pirate has a magical machine where an apple can be uploaded, and then anyone can download and eat a copy of the apple. You still have the same situation. The creator of the original apple is not being compensated for the copy, but any given copy <i>might</i> not actually chance the creator's finances, since the pirate might not have consumed the apple at all if piracy were not available. And yet, in this case, the pirate probably paid <i>something</i> for the copy of the apple. You might imagine, for example, that it took some amount of energy to create the copy. Chances are that the pirate paid for that energy. You can assume that, absent the piracy, this energy may not have been used. So, you have an energy company gaining profit that it would not have otherwise gained, because of the piracy. In effect, the energy company is profiting from the creator's work, without compensating her. The same could probably be said about the network provider who supplies the pirate with his connectivity, likely for a price. Are they harming the creator? Does that harm, if it exists, depend on if the pirate would have otherwise paid for the orange? Is it a zero-sum game? That is, if there is harm, is it costing the creator as much as the power company and the pirate are gaining? If these costs are not equal, is society as a whole gaining or loosing?<br/><br/><sub>\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03b9</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285459/#Comment_285459" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T09:50:51+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  9:50AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luckily, there isn't that sort of magic machine.<br/><br/>Perhaps the problem here is that y'all are putting your creativity into something easily copyable and need to stop relying on that part for your money.<br/><br/>Ryan/GoB: Don't you specialize in boardgames?

Prevent it. I run a game retail store in my primary position now and I can assure you, preventing shoplifting is a key part of the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe store is laid out so as to avoid exposure to small pocketable items in out of sight places, the cash wrap is laid out as to be central on the floorplan and thusly can see most everywhere in the store, small items are inventoried higher up where they are more easily seen my staff, used and low value product is nearest the door, blistered miniatured packs are behind lock cases with plexiglass fronts for product viewing, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when someone is found to be trying to shoplift, they are detained and the police are called. And then we make sure the local prosecutor actually presecutes or at least pleads them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a consequence, our shoplifting loss is less than 1/4 of 1%, which is very good by retail averages.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny retail store that doesn't pay any attention to shoplifting is a retail store that will ultimately go out of business. Even retail stores that do pay attention, but ultimately let their shrinkage grow to large tend to get closed by their corporate parents. Not usually without first replacing the store manager a few times first though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are entire swaths of Metro detroit where you can not find a single on the street retail business. Shoplifting and robberies caused them all the close. Now people living in those parts of the city must drives miles even to find a simple thing like a convenience store. Intellectual property creators can easily be "shoplifted" out of business as well, then the people will simply have to learn to live without, or create everything for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRyan S.

Almost certainly this is because that's the way civil courts look at things, and piracy falls under the umbrella of the civil courts. For me though, the problem is that the piracy of created works is culturally destructive. If I ask you to do something for me, we're creating a relationship.

Many people pirated tickets to this concert (either by actually forging copies or just by sneaking in). Eventually the people running the concert just surrendered and let anyone in. In spite of this (or, I submit, <i>because</i> of this) Woodstock became a defining cultural moment.<br/><br/>The problem I have with the premise is that the "the piracy of created works severs the connection between the creator and the work" isn't the whole story. If it was, there would be no point in seeing a painting in an art museum (or, hell, on the street). Once a viewer/reader sees a work, this creates a new connection, regardless of the presence (or desires) of the creator. A pirated copy, simply by virtue of being seen by people, creates culture. That this culture might not be the culture the creator wanted doesn't necessarily mean it is "destructive".<br/><br/>In the situation you describe (where "me asking you to pay me a fair price for something is us participating in society"), you could view the "fair price" as something which creates a barrier to culture. In essence, the price says that "only some may benefit from my work". Others, namely those unwilling to pay the price, cannot benefit from it. Viewed through that lens, it is <i>commerce</i>, not piracy, that is "culturally destructive", preventing some that could have gained something from the work from "fully participating in the human endeavor".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285549/#Comment_285549" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T13:22:03+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  1:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Luckily, there isn't that sort of magic machine.</blockquote>\nLuckily?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285576/#Comment_285576" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T14:27:22+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  2:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>For me though, the problem is that the piracy of created works is culturally destructive.

(This is not a choice I made - it's a hypothetical choice.  When I was in that position, I bought it.)  But that's because it's a game made with hundreds to thousands of hours of work, and the $18 for the PDF is less than I earn in an hour of work, and what I am saying by refusing to pay that is that I value Apocalypse World less than I value two crappy summer movies, less than two unhealthy fast food meals -- and since I value it more than that, I have to lie to myself to justify the copy.  If I copy AW instead of paying for it, Vincent is out $18 minus PayPal fees, and that's not fair or reasonable.<br/><br/>But here, we're talking about <i>creators.</i>  If I buy a $25 copy of GURPS Space, how much do the <i>creators</i> see of that?  I'd bet less than $3, with the other $20 going to middlemen.  If the idea is to see that the <i>creators</i> get compensation for their work, they're better off if I download an illegitimate copy and send them a check for $10.  Further, when I give $18 to the creator of Apocalypse World for his work, it creates a relationship.  When I give $25 to a website for a copy of GURPS Space, and quarterly that website gives $3 per copy sold to the authors, there's really no relationship there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285582/#Comment_285582" name="Item_220" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T14:33:54+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  2:33PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except in some of those cases, the creators have decided dealing with crap other than actual creation is a pain in the ass and have happily delegated it to a middleman and paid them for it.

You cultivate a fanbase who will support you and promote you to their friends and acquaintances.  But that obviously only works if the artist wants to put energy into building and maintaining that relationship with his/her fans (and asking for their money!), and if the fans are satisfied with that kind of relationship (and consider it worth spending cash on).  It can't work for everyone, and there are musicians and fans who were perhaps happier with, and better served by, the old model:  the reclusive and mysterious artist creates the music, the record label distributes it and handles the icky business of getting money out of people, and the fans get to feel like the artist is pure and unspoiled and making the music out of pure joy unmarred by crass material concerns.  Or, less pejoratively, the artists get to put more energy into creating art, because they're not busy putting energy into creating a profitable relationship with fans and doing all the insanely labor-intensive self-promotion.<br/><br/><br/>But I do think that, especially these days, people like to know where the money they're spending is actually going, no matter what business model is being used.  If you're told something will cost you $10, you think "Do I have $10, and would I rather spend this money on something else?"  But if you're told something costs $10, of which $1 goes to cover the transaction fees, $3 goes to the vendor who's selling it, and $6 goes to the creator...that adds an awareness of the <i>people</i> on the other side of the purchase.  It's not just me and my ten bucks anymore, it's me giving my ten bucks <i>to people</i>.  And that's kind of a relationship, even if I never get a handwritten thank-you note from the creator or any other kind of acknowledgment.  It appeals to the moralist in me, if nothing else.<br/><br/>(That this kind of pricing transparency would also expose the gross inequities of some business models is an attractive side effect, in my opinion.  I think a lot of consumers would be appalled at how little some creators get paid in comparison to the middlemen who arguably add little or nothing of value to the product.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285590/#Comment_285590" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T15:17:24+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  3:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam Dray: sure, the middlemen and distributors are people too.

He doesn't make ANY monkey on e-books, because he gives away electronic and even audiobook versions of his work for free.  I, too, have no idea whether he lives on his book sales or not, but one thing he seems to be saying is that not only can't he stop people from sharing/copying/pirating electronic versions of his work but he doesn't want to because doing so would be: impossible, pointless (because he sees them more as marketing to help spread knowledge of him and his work), and even unethical (because he considers copying to be a natural urge).<br/>You didn't name names about the folks you're talking to, so I can't say whether I've heard of them or not.

I'm posing it to Jim Crocker specifically, because he's made the analogy between unauthorized copying and shoplifting, and I'm curious about his answer, but anyone else can comment.  (Like I could stop you.)<br/><br/>Suppose there was a technological development that meant every book you sold brought you somewhere between two and three times as much profit per sale, without increasing the cost to the purchaser, but it meant that if someone walked out of your store with a book under his or her overcoat, there was nothing you could do about it and you would just lose that book.  Would that development be worth using?<br/><br/>What I'm most interested in here is the reasoning behind the answer.</blockquote>\nNo. Because the moment people figured out that there were no enforceable consequences for shoplifting, it'd soar. The level of shrinkage we'd see would quickly offset the increased profit.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, also, that just as there are fine distinctions I missed between 'sunk' cost and 'marginal' cost, there's also a huge difference between gross and net profit. Gross profit on a typical hobby game is in the 45-50% range. NET profit, after rent, fixed costs like utilities, payroll, and yes, shrinkage, run in the 5-10% range.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285594/#Comment_285594" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T15:38:49+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  3:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>Adam Dray: sure, the middlemen and distributors are people too.

As folks like Josh have and Rob have attested as well, it's possible to be selective about WHICH middlemen add value of a sort you find useful. It may well be that selling your entire print run to Alliance no longer makes sense. It may be that having your games on display in the couple of dozen progressive and activist game stores around the country is worth taking a margin hit in exchange for the exposure.

I sort of wish that this was the rule rather than the exception, and that you didn't have to be paying close attention to know that (for example) a musician gets a bigger share of the price of a download from Bandcamp.com than they do from iTunes or Amazon, or how much work some company really is doing to get a product out there and how genuinely supportive they are, or whatever.  I suppose I just wish that finding out that information wasn't so uncommon, or so hard to do.<br/><br/>There's probably a line where useful transparency becomes Too Much Information, but most of the time I feel like we're miles and miles away from that line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285622/#Comment_285622" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T17:27:05+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  5:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>Obviously, as a sleazy and useless Middleman, I am as biased in the other direction as the creators are in this one.<br/></blockquote>\nThere are good middlemen and bad middlemen: good middlemen more than earn their portion of the fee by functioning as curators and promoters.  It seems to me that a store owner who talks to a customer, gets to know the customer's tastes, and says, "I have the *perfect* book for you," well, that owner is more than earning his share.

Maybe not always, but often. There's a reason not everyone goes indie. Even if you just point at the near distribution monopoly they have (for brick and mortar stores, anyway), they worked hard to build those business relationships. But they do more than that.<br/><br/>My wife is a professional fiction author, just now breaking into the scene. She's being published by two "real" New York publishing houses. It'll be five trade paperbacks and eight novella eBooks over the next couple years, plus whatever new contracts she manages to land. /brag<br/><br/>She has to do much of the marketing herself. It's really a pain in the ass, we're finding. She's had to learn about layout and printers and binding and stuff to make excerpt books. She is getting to the point where she just wants to pay people to do this stuff for her, and she's generally a real penny pincher. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/><br/>Her publishers are providing her with real value. They've taken a financial risk on her work, paying her an advance on royalties (as pretty much every author gets). They've edited her work. They've provided cover art (and for her Berkley book, this involved a model search, photographers, painters, etc.). They will print the books and ship them to book stores. They will promote the work and handle a certain amount of the publicity, though she is expected to do a good deal of this herself (as a new author, anyway). <br/><br/>I don't understand why people seem to hate the "middlemen" so much. Yes, they take a large chunk of change. They also do a lot and take risks. They can provide an economy of scale that individuals cannot achieve. <br/><br/>I'm not poopooing on the indie publishing scene either. I love and support indie publishing. I love seeing real competition to the old multitier model. But I'd be sad if the big guys went away entirely, or the indie people went away entirely. They both serve a purpose.<br/><br/>And I doubt most people care where the dollars go. Maybe a certain class of internet person.

Also, letting you have a book /right now/, not 2-3 days shipping from now. If this isn't valuable to you, then you obviously have no need for bookstores. I stop in my local B&amp;N occasionally and it's always hopping, so people obviously still find it valuable. I also support my local "small business" bookstore and my local FLGS.

My friend Patty Briggs, who writes urban fantasy, had her first novel (in that genre) displayed on a weekend when the next Twilight book was due out.  As it happened, the Twilight book was delayed, but word didn't reach the fans, who mobbed the stores and ended up picking up Patty's book instead.  Now her books are consistently hitting <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> on the NYT bestseller list.  I haven't talked to her about ebooks.  Obviously lightning struck in her case, but she definitely benefited from the middleman positioning.<br/><br/>Elizabeth, I think your idea sounds lovely, sort of a shareware model.  In practice, I think it's a high-trust model that depends on both creator and consumer being honest, direct, and ethical, which may be unrealistic to expect from everyone in a practical sense.  Further, I suspect it would break down if the numbers increased past a certain threshold.  The time to reach closure on each transaction becomes both attenuated and potentially much higher, depending on how long it takes for the communication.<br/><br/>Here's an example: we shipped the original Tribes in 1998 without DRM, and it spread like wildfire, becoming hugely popular.  Unfortunately, very few of those fans bought the game, so Sierra received very little money on the title.  By very little, I mean "took a significant loss."  If Tribes 2 hadn't screwed the proverbial canine, we might have seen profit on that game based on the wide penetration from the first, but that's really a hypothetical.   We don't know how long the anti-piracy measures on that game would have held out, or what impact piracy would have had.  The production cost of T2 meant that we had to see astronomical sales to break even.  So in this case, most fans who loved the game and played it incessantly (based on our survey of the server numbers over time) didn't support the creators.<br/><br/>I think middlemen often do add quite a bit of value.  I try to buy local when I can, and I educate myself about the goods and services I get, but I don't expect a high-fidelity relationship with everyone in my supply web.  I mean, I still buy organic from out of state, or even out of country.  I don't always buy the local product if it's significantly more expensive than the equivalent from another source.  As an author, even when you have the assistance of a publishing house, there's a lot of marketing and promotion work to do.  If you're self-published, that promotional slice of your day becomes significantly larger.<br/><br/>I took my opinion from Doctorow's essay, in which (as I recall) he implied he made more by giving his work away for free than by selling it.  I don't have a beef with him, and I appreciate free stuff as much as the next guy, but he's choosing to do that.  No one is appropriating his stuff without his permission or against his wishes.  That's the moral crux of this discussion, I think.<br/><br/>In some ways, the argument for digital works being free and unprotected on account of the marginal reproduction cost approaching zero seems to say that the lower the marginal cost of production, the greater the moral justification for simply taking a unit of whatever without compensating the producer.<br/><br/><i>Here's a question: </i> if we could implement a moderate technological DRM solution that worked in most cases without hugely authoritarian or intrusive means, say some sort of file key-lock that actually held out against modern decryption without slogging your experience with the content, and thus the genie of cost-free digital reproduction was put back in the bottle, would that change anyone's outlook?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285802/#Comment_285802" name="Item_239" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T10:18:48+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:18AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            komradebob wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Perhaps the problem here is that y'all are putting your creativity into something easily copyable and need to stop relying on that part for your money.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan/GoB: Don't you specialize in boardgames?

No, a hypothetically perfect DRM solution -- or even a hypothetical DRM solution that's no less intrusive than the physicality of books -- would not change my outlook, because I think copyright as currently constructed is broken.  (More generally, I don't think such a DRM solution is possible.)<br/><br/>To summarize my point of view: copyright is a deal where society says, you have the right to determine who copies this in exchange for your duty to make it available to people who want it for a reasonable price.  When you aren't making it available for a reasonable price, you aren't holding up your end of the bargain, so society doesn't have any obligation to hold up its end of the bargain.  The ethical thing to do is to pay the creator what he or she asks, provided he or she is asking.<br/><br/>(If the creator wants to ask $25 so that he can pass on $22 to the marketers and middlemen, that's his business, not mine.  I don't think most middlemen add much value, and if I think a thing is worth paying $25 for, I'd rather pay $25 to the creator rather than $2 to the creator and $23 to assorted middlemen, but it's up to the creator what sort of deals he negotiates and what parts of the work he'd rather pay someone else to do for him.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285817/#Comment_285817" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T10:41:58+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:41AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite><i>Here's a question:</i>if we could implement a moderate technological DRM solution that worked in most cases without hugely authoritarian or intrusive means, say some sort of file key-lock that actually held out against modern decryption without slogging your experience with the content, and thus the genie of cost-free digital reproduction was put back in the bottle, would that change anyone's outlook?</blockquote>\nIt comes as no surprise that it would change mine. Were something like that available, copyright would be rather viable once more. I wouldn't still advocate hunting pirates, but then you <i>wouldn't need to</i> because pirated works would again be occasional rarities, the distribution networks would starve for the lack of product, customers would flock back to commercial outlets with their better product selections and people would grow consistently accustomed to paying for stuff once more. Meanwhile our view of copyright as something real and substantial would be renewed as copyright would, in fact, be just that. With time people would no doubt grow to consider their digital files as real property with collectible value, just like the industry would like them to.<br/><br/>As we've touched on, though, I find this prospect of successful DRM almost impossible technologically due to how the information networks work. You just need one person able to crack the given DRM, after which it's easy for him to let the work loose for everybody else to distribute. That's an awful lot of cracking power. Less popular properties don't get cracked automatically of course, but it seems that anything with a significant following and a digital representation has so far been successfully pirated, with no exceptions.<br/><br/>The property-like rights in cultural work come from the ability to sustain the idea both juridically and <i>practically</i>, as I've outlined in this thread. Protect copyright effectively, and it becomes a feasible basis upon which to build the interactions and properties of the culture industry. Break it down as has effectively been done, and we face the daunting prospect of downscaling this culture industry of ours into pre-copyright levels once more, getting rid of the structures that have been built to depend on copyright.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285825/#Comment_285825" name="Item_242" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T10:55:40+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another consideration is to have steps involved in the cracking.

The bit that's not working for me in your insistence on societal rights to payment is that when I mow your lawn I'm entitled to a payment only if we have a prior contract on it; if I do it without you asking, you are not obligated to pay me despite you deriving benefit from it. Why is it that a creator making something and  relinquishing his effective control over his creation (by publishing it) gets to expect a payment? I can totally understand how this works when copyright is enforceable, and how this works when a creator tragically <i>thinks</i> that copyright is enforceable, but to me it seems utterly screwy that you would impose an active duty onto others to make a business model viable when it no longer is. Morally, on an individual level there might be some basis for being annoyed or even despaired at the lack of empathy on the parts of your fellow men, but that's no news - society doesn't function based on empathy exactly because that tends to benefit those with none.<br/><br/>Even better simile: if I'm a baker and insist that my business model is to truck all of my produce to the curb every morning for anybody to take with no security whatsoever, I'm sure that the people taking the bread are still morally obligated to pay me, but is it realistic or useful for me to act aggrieved when they don't? Is the baker justified in his anger by the fact that this business model used to work before, when his business was situated in a nice little hippie commune where everybody knew everybody else and the honor system was intact and he could personally sit by his cart of produce and keep track of who is taking his bread? It worked once, so I'm entitled to having it work forevermore? This is a very high-spirited position, but I tend towards more fiscal realism myself simply because a mere moral stand is not sufficient for creating a society between people not controlled by moral principles alone. Thinking it is leads to highly theoretical societal constructs such as communism or any of your favourite utopias; surely great places to live, and they would function perfectly if only everybody always did the right thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285993/#Comment_285993" name="Item_245" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T22:51:39+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2010 10:51PM by jhkim.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are my two cents: <br/><br/>I feel a good analogy for the issue is a big area of open land owned by a society.  One extreme positions would be it should be a public park - everyone collectively helps maintain and develop it, and everyone freely enjoys it.  This value the land as free and open territory, and think that fences and patrols detract from the park, even if they are over sections that wouldn't otherwise be used.  Another extreme position would be that it should be parceled out as entirely private property - with those who do work on a section of land own it, and the landscape is primarily these private parcels.  These views are fundamentally opposed.  Those who want the land public are annoyed since they work for the common good, while others benefit from the public land yet fence off the land that they work on.  <br/><br/>I think land is a better analogy for two reasons.  Unlike physical goods, there is a huge amount of creativity and thought that is exchanged freely.  There is enormous value in the free exchange of ideas and expression.  Second, no creative work is created from nothing.  An author of a book owes a lot to all sorts of prior learning, conversations, and prior writing both public domain and copyrighted.  <br/><br/>Of course, many people hold a moderate position.  A person who has worked on a parcel should be respected for that work and have privileges over there, but it is not the same as owning an object and should have limits.  Personally, I have basically no problem with trademark law, but in practice I feel both copyright and patent law are completely out of whack.  In particular, the length of copyright is ridiculously long, and I feel that works like fan fiction and mash-ups should be legal.  The implementation of patents seems to mean that most are bogus, and getting a patent is more about knowing how to work the system than inventing something.  So while I disapprove of much of blatant pirating, I find it hard to side with the law given my issues with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285997/#Comment_285997" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T00:51:53+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 12:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note: if this post gets a little meandering and boring, jump to the dotted line: the section that follows is, I humbly claim, the most important post in this thread.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Seth Drebitko</cite>Another consideration is to have steps involved in the cracking. For example I don't know anyone who pirates software or for the most part video games. The steps after downloading the software to get it to work is enough of a turn off.

In fact, one of the most compelling arguments against DRM is that the pirate copy is often easier to install, and more reliable than the DRM version. Look through the history of any video game discussion forum, and you'll find accounts of people being unable to install games or crashes in games that are traced to the DRM, and are avoided by using a CD-key or other method of bypassing the DRM.<br/>I have experienced that first hand.<br/>(Note: It's not that the DRM-creators are incompetent, it's just adding extra complexity provides more points of failure. Plus, that added code is designed to stop the game working under certain circumstances-  and no solution is perfect. It's going to 'work' at times it isn't meant to.)<br/><br/>Here are my experiences with games, that occurred pretty close together in time (while this is a digression, I have a reason for detailing these examples):<br/><br/>I bought Bioshock from direct2drive.com, which needed to be activated online before I could use it. Every time I came to play it, it told me it needed to be activated, and to their credit, D2D's support was very good. They admitted the DRM in Bioshock was problematic, and after working through all possible solutions, they just gave me an artificially boosted number of activations (instead of the 5 usually allowed). But I still needed to activate each time, so I gave up, and bought the steam version when it was on sale. It didn't put me off Direct2Drive though, since I'd bought other games from them and didn't have this problem.<br/><br/>I bought Burnout Paradise from EA games, and found it just would not install. I found their technical service atrocious (every time I dealt with a different rep, and they kept asking me the most basic questions - that I'd already given them the answers to in my initial posting of the problem), and the only way I could solve this problem was to download a pirate copy of the game.<br/><br/>I bought the steam version of Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher's Bay, and for a time all was well. But then I had a couple of problems with my computer, and needed to reinstall windows a few times, each time installing the game. Then I got a new computer, and tried installing it on that and found I couldn't - I was out of activations. Then I discovered they used a DRM technology called TAGES, and the most onerous implementation of that technology. You are allowed 5 activations, and each change of hardware or computer uses up your activations. So I contacted Steam, they referred me to Atari who make they game. They did not answer at all, but on their forums I found a link to the TAGES site, and contacted them, and they told me they didn't deal with the customer directly, I needed to take it up with Atari. And Atari once again did not reply at all. I did use multiple email addresses to try to contact them, but the consensus on the forums was that they just didn't care, and didn't bother replying - so off to the download sites I went.<br/><br/>Now, after experiences like this, I don't buy new games anymore - I don't have that much disposable income, so I keep an eye out for sales. One thing I've noticed when re-installing windows, transferring to new computers, etc, those pirate copies require much less maintenance than my legally acquired games - with the exception of those bought through steam. Which is the only example I have encountered of DRM-done-right - DRM that <i>adds</i> value. <br/><br/>So, because of incidents like these, the game industry has lost money from me. The question is: is the loss they have inflicted worth it, for them? I'll get to that in a moment.<br/><br/>While writing this I had the observation that the creative industries are actually different to other products a consumer may buy: there is a special risk to a consumer. if I buy a fridge, or a car, or stereo, and it doesn't work, I can return it - maybe sometimes the store will try to object, but in the end they'll accept it. Okay, a bunch of cowboys may do a shoddy job of building my patio, and the legal route to a resolution may not practically be available, but in general, most tangible goods have a legal requirement to be suitable for the purpose they were bought.<br/><br/>It's a lot fuzzier with creative properties. If I buy a book, or film, or rpg, or software, and the advertising turns out to be misleading, and it turns out to be not what I expected, I can't usually return it. So there is a genuine risk to the consumer, that reading reviews can only mitigate a little - not eliminate entirely. That's why I believe a lot of the people who say they download as a try-before-buy, and then if they like it, they buy it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if that point is relevant, but I'm rambling anyway so I just thought I'd throw it out there in an attempt to write a post longer than one of Eero's.<br/><br/>Still, there are also plenty of people who download who don't fit into that category. And so, lots of other people say, "game X had a piracy rate of 90%, so 90% of gamers are pirate scum and are killing the video game industry." Sadly, the people who make those claims aren't maths geeks. Here's a post from another debate on video game piracy, that was largely ignored by the other debaters, because they each had their own viewpoints and principles to preach, and weren't overly concerned with the facts.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>In my experience the vast majority of pirates will pirate almost everything they hear about and buy virtually nothing, ever.<br/><br/>Consider this thought experiment:<br/><br/>There is a community of 10,000 gamers, half of them only buy games, half only pirate.<br/><br/>There is a pool of 100 games for these guys to choose from.<br/><br/>Each paying customer buys about 5 games per year.<br/><br/>Each paying customer has a ~5.1% chance of buying your game for an average of ~255 sales.<br/><br/>We will pretend the unrepentant pirates will pirate half the games out there.<br/><br/>That is ~2500 pirates for your game.<br/><br/>Or about 90% of your player base.<br/><br/>This is all completely unsubstantiated conjecture.<br/><br/>But it might help put things in perspective.<br/><br/>Even if every unrepentant pirate would buy games if they could not be bought, that wouldn't mean that you would get 10 times more paying customers, it would mean that at best your would get 2 times with these numbers.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/>Think about the above. Understand it.<br/><br/>The actual numbers can be juggled in lots of different ways. But what it tells you is: the number of active pirates in a society can be small, but because they are greedy and download everything in sight, it's possible to say things like: "90% of the copies of this game or book or movie in circulation are pirate copies! our industry is doomed!" While at the same time, it can be and probably is true, that the extra customer base available to you, if every pirate was forced to become a consumer, might be quite small.<br/><br/>Here's an article to a similar point of view, from the people who gave the Indie games Bundle - 5 indie games for as little as you want to pay, including $0.01. He showed how the industry might have as little as 10-20% pirates, and yet have accurateb figures claiming that 80-90% of games are pirate.

We don't have reliable figures. Even wih massive piracy rates, you might only have an extra 100% possible consumers available to you, or maybe even as little as 10% extra. Is it really that big of a problem?<br/><br/>*experiences a moment of panic after hitting the Add Your Comments button and the post fails to post - please don't make me type this again... whew, it's still there.*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285999/#Comment_285999" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T01:38:18+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  1:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: JDCorley&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: TylerT&lt;/cite&gt;how do you handle products that are exclusively digital, how do you feel about books that do not have game rules at all?&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor  me, I don't even look at p2p e-books anymore now that Blackmask is back up in the form of&lt;a href="<a href="http://www.munseys.com/&quot;&gt;Munsey's&lt;/a&gt;and&lt;a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.munseys.com/"&gt;Munsey's&lt;/a&gt;and&lt;a</a> href="<a href='http://books.google.com/"&gt;Google' rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://books.google.com/"&gt;Google</a> Books&lt;/a&gt;has given me more public domain stuff than I can shake a stick at.

The bit that's not working for me in your insistence on societal rights to payment is that when I mow your lawn I'm entitled to a payment only if we have a prior contract on it; if I do it without you asking, you are not obligated to pay me despite you deriving benefit from it. Why is it that a creator making something and relinquishing his effective control over his creation (by publishing it) gets to expect a payment?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286544/#Comment_286544" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T16:56:36+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  4:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, my name is chearns and I'm a file-sharer.<br><br>I'll limit my text here to RPGs (since what do y'all care about how I deal with movies, music, comics, television programs...). I'll also try and limit it to actual stories from my life.<br><br><i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. I copied it. This was the game that got me back into playing RPGs (even though it was years between reading it and playing it). I, I have no idea how, but I found it on a torrent site and DLed it, read it, and was amazed at how far RPGs had come since I walked away (some five years earlier if one is generous, but more like ten really). A year or two later I would go on to buy the game (in pdf form), because, even though I was broke (I am on year five of being unemployed and currently live off of welfare) I had spoken with Vincent a few times on knife-fight and figured I could eat a little less one week. This was the start of my purchasing games when I can.<br/><br/><i>Donjon</i>. Was available free online (on Clinton's website), but was the other game that made me say wow, so I bought it too (pdf).<br/><br/>In case anyone wonders, I buy pdfs because I find buying books to be morally questionable, at best, and down right wrong at worst. So, make of that what you will Joshua. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>D&amp;D fourth. Downloaded it. Read lots of the player's handbook. Felt it was glorifying racial essentialism and white supremacy (also, the game was way too complex for me). Deleted it. Never bought it, never will. Have absolutely no feelings of guilt whatsoever.<br/><br/>3:16. Downloaded it. Played it. Then read it. Then asked Gregor where I should buy the pdf to maximize his profits, then bought it from there.<br/><br/><i>InSpectres</i>. Downloaded it. Read it. Played it. Bought the pdf. In that order.<br/><br/>Here's one that goes differently. Downloaded someone's book about how to play RPGs (not going to name it), thought it was brilliant and it most definitely affects how I play RPGs today. The author is a huge bigot though (as far as I can tell, on the issues of gender and sexual orientation), and so I refuse to pay for the pdf.<br/><br/><i>Mortal Coil</i>. Downloaded the first edition. Read it. Said to myself, hey, I think this game will interest my partner, so we talked about it, and sure enough, we decided we'd play. However, I'd rather play from the revised pdf as opposed to the first edition plus the errata, so I purchased the revised pdf.<br/><br/><i>Microcosm</i>. Free game. I put it on a file sharing site because it's great fun. Interestingly, this is the only game I've ever put on a file-sharing site. Not sure what to make of that.<br/><br/>Random rpg (this is what usually happens). I download it. And then one of the following happens. I find it racist or sexist, and delete it. There's too much fluff (setting and fiction), so I delete it. The mechanics don't interest me, so I delete it. Almost every download has that happen to it.<br/><br/>There are a few other stories, games that I've read, that I still have the copied pdf for, haven't played and haven't bought. I feel pretty confident that one day they'll either be deleted or paid for.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286546/#Comment_286546" name="Item_250" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T17:33:23+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  5:33PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 5:37PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>In case anyone wonders, I buy pdfs because I find buying books to be morally questionable, at best, and down right wrong at worst.

So the resources used as materials for the book, the resources that put the book together, the resources that are used to ship the book, and the space required to store the book prior to sale, are put to poor use when the entire product can be shipped without petrol as a series of ones and zeros. Everyone pays when those resources are lost, and yet they are considered to be privately owned. Wood and petrol affect my ability to breathe (as well as everyone else's), they are hardly suitable for private consumption when other options exist.<br/><br/>When it comes to moral actions, I usually just ask the question, what if everyone did this (that's right, what if six billion people did it). When it comes to resource usage, the answer is usually it would be better if we didn't.<br/><br/>Obviously, this doesn't apply to people who can't use a pdf. Like, say, someone who doesn't own a computer.<br/><br/>******<br/><br/>Originally I was going to answer in a whisper, thinking it had nothing to do with the conversation at hand, but I realize it might help understand the perspective behind the actions I've taken. I mean, if you can write me off as unreasonable and bizarre for my viewpoint on physical artefacts, then my file-sharing habits too can be written off as unreasonable and bizarre and inapplicable to the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286582/#Comment_286582" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T22:49:01+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 10:49PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            chearns,<br/><br/>Cool, I can understand that.

Got all those songs I couldn't afford (in some cases, even find), and play them on my computer. I've slowed down my downloading almost to a halt. Like, how much music do I <i>need</i>? Every once in a while, there's a song I want, and I'll go look for it on Limewire.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't often go to concert. When I do (not often), and I like the artist (often), and I can afford it (relative), I'll buy their CD right then and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also downloaded a few movies and tv show episodes. And I've watched  movies on youtube cut in parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for games and books. So far, I've only downloaded free pdfs of games and books (the latter because they were in the public domain) or I've bought them (often with a book+pdf bundle deal). I do file share games, but only with friends. I don't torrent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't torrent in part because I never learned how, my previous Internet arrangement had an upload/download limit. My current one doesn't, but the computer I'm using isn't very powerful, uses some version of Linux and I can't seem to figure out how to install anything new on it, and I'm just not very motivated to learn because I'm in a "down with comsumerism!" phase.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that'll change in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeologically, I'm all for the free sharing of information, art and ideas. I also believe the creator must be compensated, duh. But I'm a bleeding heart socialist, you know. I don't believe people should have to work to live. I believe everyone should get the minimum they need for food, shelter and dignity, and any money they make with their work should be to supplement that amount. But that's another discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287737/#Comment_287737" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T23:20:52+00:00" title="August 19, 2010 11:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't really think of anything Eero has said that I disagree with.

So, "other derogatory action" doesn't just mean "anything else," but means anything like the former. See <a href="http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/ejusdem-generis.htm" rel="nofollow">Ejusdem Generis</a>. Every case or article that I've read that deals with the right of integrity usually entails something like Adam's KKK hypo, the destruction of a sculpture, or prints that use slightly different colors than the original artwork. I've never seen the right of integrity used in a case of run-of-the-mill copyright infringement (like Adam's torrenting or FATAL/SenZar bundling hypos). Of course, I'd be perfectly willing to accept that I haven't read every case or article and be pointed to one where this was successfully argued.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>Moral rights do, in fact, place copyright in the category of inalienable human right. This is the basic gist of the Berne Convention, which the vast majority of countries of the world have signed. That is, moral rights are by definition natural (fundamental, inalienable) rights. You may believe otherwise, but the vast majority of the world is on the other side of that argument.<br/></blockquote>\nAgain, moral rights are separate and distinct from copyright. Copyright is not inalienable. Inalienable doesn't mean fundamental under natural law, it means that the thing can't be bought, sold, or transferred. Thus, even in France, and in every country that recognizes copyright, copyright is alienable. Moral rights, despite not being expressed as such in Berne, are inalienable in every jurisdiction I'm aware of. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>OK, so with regard to the hypotheticals:<br/><br/>Putting a free PDF up as a torrent without the author's consent--copyright infringement; the fact that it is free will affect damages, but it is still copyright infringement. It is copyright that gives the author the exclusive right of distribution.<br/><br/>Putting a work on the back of a KKK document--copyright infringement and arguably a violation of the author's right of integrity; If the author has the copyright they have a claim. Adam is right that the U.S. provides very limited protection for an author's moral rights. Let's say the author no longer has the copyright, and the copyright owner is unwilling to litigate, or the author actually licensed the work to the person who then without the author's consent published it on the back of a KKK document: in the US, the author could make a claim under 43(a) of the Lanham Act for false endorsement (basically, she could prevail if the court finds that there is a likelihood that the public will think that she endorses the KKK). In France, the author could simply argue a violation of her right of integrity (it'd likely be a much easier argument).<br/><br/>Ara                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289258/#Comment_289258" name="Item_262" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T15:59:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  3:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't read all 262 posts, so I'm actually just responding to the original post.<br/><br/>I do download PDFs of games, but it's simply not practical to play off the PDFs - reading from a screen is tiresome and trying to scroll around just doesn't work as easily. If I'm at all going to play a game, it's necessary to buy the physical copy. I figure that's fair enough, if I'm getting enjoyment out of playing it, the writers get some money. If I never play it, well, I've spent hundreds of dollars on books I never got to play with, can't afford to keep doing that.<br/><br/>My attitude's really the same for anything else - I've got a limited budget so I stick to buying the stuff that's really good, and I usually can only tell that after the fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289825/#Comment_289825" name="Item_263" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T09:34:29+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the clarifications, Ara. I intentionally used the term "moral copyright" to fend off confusion (with "natural rights") that would result if I started talking about "moral rights." I've seen "moral copyright" used in places to specify which part of copyright (the moral rights part) a writer is discussing. <br/><br/>Most of my hypotheticals were intended to make a point about how I felt I could be harmed by different kinds of acts that may or may not be legal infringement. I don't know if the bundling tort would hold up in civil court, for example, but it'd still bother me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12659/file-sharing-and-you/p5" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12659/file-sharing-and-you">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12659/file-sharing-and-you/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12659/file-sharing-and-you/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12659/file-sharing-and-you/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12659/file-sharing-and-you/p5" rel="prev">5</a><a class="Highlight p-6 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12659/file-sharing-and-you/p6">6</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12659%2Fx%2Fp6%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12659%2Fx%2Fp6%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
