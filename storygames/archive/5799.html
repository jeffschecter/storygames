Too bad I work until 5pm on Saturday. I'm going to try to make it Sunday, so maybe we can hang.<br/><br/>Also, we're starting an Indie Game group in Auburn. Our first session is March 1, and we're going to play InSpectres. I don't know if I'm hosting or not, but you're welcome to come join us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130083/#Comment_130083" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T20:27:45+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  8:27PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was waffling on making a day trip down for the con on Sat but the chance play in a Dresden Files playtest I think made the deal for me.

I've not done this before and could use all the help I can get.  I'm going to bring pretty much all my quick play games even if I haven't run them before.  I'm kinda hoping to have a group of us to trade out running games for each other so we can all get better.  <br/><br/>Scott                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133980/#Comment_133980" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T09:38:56+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  9:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For anyone who may be in the area, we've now got 3 GMs running games during the day Saturday and I'm running DRYH and Dreden Files at night (bleeding alpha rules).
