I do, however, get to fool around with free demos all I want, and this is how I managed to get my hands on at least 90 minutes' worth of <a href="http://www.darksiders.com/" rel="nofollow">Darksiders</a>.  It's a tease, for sure, but it also got me thinking about characters with incredible abilities.  The ultimate in power fantasy.<br/><br/>I was a good consumer and I bought the <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> back in \u2014 what was it? \u2014 2002.  I looked through the book and checked out the pretty pictures and I had a vague idea of how it would all work but I didn't really know what it'd be like to wrestle with characters possessed of that much power.  I still don't.<br/><br/>Well, maybe I do, thanks to <i>Darksiders</i>.  The sheer strength and size and presence of the character gives the first clues.  When War falls from a decent height he slams into the ground so heavily that he leaves a crater.  He has the aforementioned ten-foot sword and can use it to hack and slay with ruthless abandon.  Nothing stands in his way.  And don't get me started on his massive scythe.<br/><br/>There are a couple of games I can think of that could accommodate this level of play.  One is D&amp;D, of course, and the other is <a href="http://danielbayn.com/wushu/" rel="nofollow">Wushu</a>.  Want to kick all kinds of demon ass?  They're happy to provide an outlet.<br/><br/>But\u2026.<br/><br/>Surely kicking ass is a big part of playing such a tremendously powerful character, but are there other things to do, too?  I wonder because I've never actually played a character with the sheer physicality of War.  I imagine it would take quite a while for the novelty of being able to lay waste to everything in sight would wear off and then\u2026 what?  It's hard to imagine War from <i>Darksiders</i> settling down to rule a kingdom or what have you.  So are we talking about the sort of game where the ass-kicking goes on forever until finally its potential is exhausted and the character is put aside?  Has anyone here ever taken things that far?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/war.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261894/#Comment_261894" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T09:28:01+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  9:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2010 9:45AM by FigureFour.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is sort of why I've been really eager to play Exalted lately.<br/><br/>I believe the basic idea being that you start at the world shakingly badass phase and build from there. However, Exalted doesn't really limit you to being a physical badass. I'm pretty sure there's a charm to sell someone their own grandmother if you want to play that sort of guy.<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that looking at Exalted stuff sort of helped me wrap my head around that style of game and I don't think it's actually that much different from any other game where the players have a reasonable amount of control over the story. The setting is bigger and more epic, but I don't think what you're actually doing needs to change that much.<br/><br/>You're just a fantasy hero with the fate of nations, or even worlds, in your hands, instead of villages and towns.<br/><br/>Oh, it just occurred to me that the setting material in Exalted may be part of what makes that work. I played an epic level D&amp;D 3E game back in 200x and I think it failed because we had scaled up characters but not a scaled up setting to match. The WORLD needs to be epic enough to handle that shit or everything turns into a mook fight. So War is cool when he's fighting demons and dragons with a city as collateral damage, but it wouldn't be as cool if he was fighting the US Marines.<br/><br/>It's like Godzilla. It's fun when he's smashing tanks and shit, but eventually another monster needs to show up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261895/#Comment_261895" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T09:53:30+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  9:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From playing Nobilis, I've learned one key rule with regards to this kind of play:<br/><br/>When you can utterly destroy -- in fact, <i>unmake</i> -- lesser creatures, longevity in play comes almost entirely from conflict with your equals. (Almost entirely - a mortal love interest cannot simply be slain when you want to win an argument.

Celestial Exalts need to have a truly epic setting - Solars in particular are all about PUNCHING MOUNTAINS IN SPACE, at least if they have any desire whatsoever to be physically potent. I have a dream of someday playing a Dreams of the First Age game, since you are a god-king in a whole big wealthy society of god-kings, which if done right would be an interesting dynamic (and if done poorly would just make the PCs not feel all that special, like if they constantly get smacked down by older, more powerful, crazier Exalts).<br/>\n<br/>\nExalted is much easier to run for Dragon-Bloods, since they care deeply about who gets invited to whose tea-party this week and ohmigod did you hear what Fumiko said about Ichiro's Old Realm pronunciation, but starting characters can still easily be in command of small armies, vast estates, and/or fly through the air at 80 miles an hour for an arbitrary distance without any means of conveyance. I think Exalted is especially suited to sandbox-y sort of play, since there really should be no setting elements that the GM isn't comfortable having smashed to bits or warped beyond recognition, and so the players can just run hog wild and be perfectly in keeping with the setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I really ought to adopt the "through the crosshairs" principle from Apocalypse World when running a game focusing on Celestial Exalts. <br/>\n<br/>\nRe: Nobilis, yes, yes, yes. Though some of that longevity comes from the fact that most Powers will have a very, very hard time seriously injuring another Power physically. This takes the easy option out of the equation, but still leaves room for impressive physical displays through the idea of shadow duels. I really do love that setting; wish the rules-as-written were better at producing the fiction from the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261916/#Comment_261916" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T11:33:45+00:00" title="March 14, 2010 11:33AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JAR</cite>In fact, I really ought to adopt the "through the crosshairs" principle from Apocalypse World when running a game focusing on Celestial Exalts.</blockquote>\nI'm not so sure about the crosshairs principle, but certainly there should be no status quo's in Exalted.

At the very least, I think you have to embrace anything that puts the powers at be on the defensive, because when that happens, they get desperate and then interesting things happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously this only is meant to apply to a Solar or (or Lunar game, if they're less about the Thousand Streams and more about wrecking shit up). Abyssals have the arcane agendas of their Deathlords who cannot be defied trivially, and I've never gotten a good handle on what Infernals are meant to be doing. Dragon-Bloods really are the establishment, so while I feel there is definite scope for a Young Turks sort of game, they are much less likely to bring about a great revolution in the affairs of Creation. This may be why my favorite DB games have happened immediately after the Contagion, when everything was fluid and the DBs were really the only people around to pick up the uncertain pieces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261934/#Comment_261934" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T14:20:45+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  2:20PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry Sam, we've stolen your thread.<br/><br/>I think the same "no status quo's" principal could (should?) still apply to Dragon Blooded games. Maybe not in the same way it does to Solars, but I don't think that the setting should remain static. Dragon Blooded are still people of awesome power, they just have less supernatural power and (much) more political power.<br/><br/>For the Dragon Blooded "wrecking shit up" could mean assassinating important people and usurping their position, conquering territories, smashing rival houses or even becoming Emperor/Empress.<br/><br/>The whole setting seems completely fluid and ready to be changed to me. The players are just given a privileged position to impose their will on that change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261943/#Comment_261943" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T15:33:15+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  3:33PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're mostly right, FF; it's more like:<br/>\n<br/>\n"I plan to get my cousin selected as the Mouth of Peace" - yes, absolutely, go for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n"I plan to burn down the Immaculate Order" - ...really?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my view, at least, the DBs can accomplish all sorts of things by working the system (and occasionally circumventing it by time-honored, de facto means) rather than extirpating institutions themselves.

There's this world, Naur Tier. It's your basic pulp fantasy world, loosely based on Earth. The details are up to you. What matters is this: the PCs are the bearers of the Fell Weapons, the angry creations of the Old Gods, forged as a last-ditch attempt to defeat the Nameless Ones and hold the Black Gulf at bay. This attempt succeeded, but the Old Gods did not survive it. Now it's just Man and the Fell Weapons, locked in an eternal cycle of battle and destruction.<br/><br/>Cycle, because <i>Charnel Gods</i> is a <i>Sorcerer</i> sourcebook. Eventually, one of the PCs will reach Humanity 0. That PC's <i>player</i> then becomes the Harbinger, who gets to describe the way the Epoch ends, and what the apocalypse looks like. They can't kill PCs or significant NPCs, and they have to be able to relate all the devastation they cause to a Humanity-losing action their PC took sometime during the game. It could take a couple of sessions to play out the end of the world, because everyone needs to resolve their loose ends. But the world is going to end, because that's what happens when you lose the remainder of your humanity and your Fell Weapon becomes more important to you than your soul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261968/#Comment_261968" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T21:23:16+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  9:23PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think tragedy follows from extreme badassery.

With extreme prejudice, because they'll fuck up your world if you don't. In one of the games I played, we hunted J\xf6rmungandr, the snake that wraps the world. You roll vast handfuls of dice and bring all of your might to bear on your enemy. The dice pools have names like "thunder" and "lightning" and you have kick-ass special abilities that grow over time. But as your abilities grow, you become -- wait for it -- more MYTHIC. Eventually, you turn into the thing you hate, and your friends have to hunt YOU down AND KILL YOU. With extreme prejudice.<br/><br/>This game was a bunch of scribbles in Ryan's notebook last year, and STILL WAS MINDBLOWINGLY AWESOME.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262023/#Comment_262023" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T09:59:28+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  9:59AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope my use of profanity and ALL CAPS helped convey the Macklin-ness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262069/#Comment_262069" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T12:53:32+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 12:53PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I hope my use of profanity and ALL CAPS helped convey the Macklin-ness.</blockquote>\nI think you did tremendously.<br/><br/>Or, rather:<br/><br/>I, JOE MCDONALD, know you KICKED ASS at "bringing THE MACKLIN" to that post.<br/>This is JOE MCDONALD, APPROVING that message.
