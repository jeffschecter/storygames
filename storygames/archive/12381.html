These are, as they might sound, a cross between Scooby-Doo cartoons and Cthulhu stories, run with Call of Cthulhu, albeit an extremely light weight version thereof. Bob has been running ScoobyThulhu games at various conventions for several years now, and I was excited to finally get a chance to participate.<br/><br/>The characters were<br/>Fred Jones<br/>Daphne Blake<br/>Velma Dinkley<br/>Norville "Shaggy" Rogers<br/>Scooby-Doo<br/><br/>featuring special guest stars<br/>Davy Jones of the Monkees<br/>The Harlem Globetrotters (all played by a single person)<br/><br/>I tweeted throughout the game, so I'll use that as the basis for my AP report.<br/><br/><i>Getting ready for ScoobyThulhu. Zoinks! Mi-go!</i><br/><br/>Play began with the Scooby Gang driving through Massachusetts on their way to a rock concert when the Mystery Machine unexpectedly broke down. Forced to stop for the night they took refuge at a Bed &amp; Breakfast run by an elderly couple. Also staying at the same B&amp;B were The Harlem Globetrotters (their bus had broken down on their way to a rock concert) and Davy Jones of the Monkees (his private bus had broken down on the way to play a rock concert).<br/><br/>Shag &amp; Scoob ate their way through plates of cookies as pleasantries with the elderly owners revealed that they were worried about being forced out of business by an evil industrialist who wanted to buy up all their land. They no longer got the business they once had since that nasty Wa-wa-wa-witch Ghost started haunting them. Shaggy and Scooby were scared, but there was no fixing the Mystery Machine until morning, so everybody had to stay.<br/><br/>Everybody went upstairs to go to bed, and sure enough in the middle of the night, Shaggy was awoken by a fluorescent green cackling witch ghost. Lots of running around, everybody waking up due to the noise, and screaming until at last the ghost disappeared mysteriously into a wall.<br/><br/>Investigation of the wall revealed a secret door, mysteriously a slightly different color than the rest of the wall around it. A staircase behind lead down into the darkness. Fred, Velma and Daphne and Davy Jones chose to investigate while Shaggy, Scooby and the Harlem Globetrotters decided to check out the kitchen. The dark staircase lead to a roughly hewn stone cavern, but then it was discovered that Daphne had somehow vanished.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Shaggy, Scooby and the Globetrotters were making giant sandwiches, when Shaggy tripped and discovered a trap door in the floor, also leading down into darkness. Just when they were thinking about investigating, the elderly woman who helped run the hotel started yelling in the foyer. Daphne was lying there, soaked, with seaweed tangled into her hair and sucker marks on her skin. Yet the ocean was miles away!<br/><br/>Everyone exhausted, but apparently safe, we again went back up to bed to continue the investigation in the morning.<br/><br/>We elected to all investigate the roughly hewn stone cavern, which lead to a small dock on a river that divided the property from that owned by the evil industrialist. There was a small boat at the dock which everyone took downstream to another small dock at the bottom of a hill, atop which sat a gaudy looking mansion. Just then:<br/><br/><i>Daphne, possessed by Ancient Horrors, killed Shaggy with an axe, but he was resurrected by Davy Jones of The Monkees.<br/><br/>Davy Jones of The Monkees skinned Shaggy's face and is wearing it like a Halloween mask.</i><br/><br/>For you see, after Daphne was subdued, and Shaggy lay bleeding, Velma saw a sandstone cavern cut into the hill, inside of which was a book. Davy Jones, who could speak German, read it, managed not to go insane, but found a spell that would bring Shaggy back to life. Doing so required him to skin Shaggy's face and hands and wear them for the duration of the ritual. Velma also managed not to go insane, but threw up a lot.<br/><br/>A staircase in the cavern lead up to another secret door that opened into the butler's quarters in the mansion on the hill. The Meddling Kids poked around until they ran into the industrialist, who threatened to call the cops if they didn't leave. He claimed not to know anything about the cavern under his house. Before leaving, Velma found a bunch of old legal papers dating back to the 1700's in the industrialist's office, and snuck them out with her.<br/><br/>Velma, Shaggy and Scooby decided to investigate the papers with the help of the library in the B&amp;B. Meanwhile, The Globetrotters, Davy Jones, Fred and Daphne went to check out the trap door in the kitchen. A great staircase lead into the dark, down down down into inky blackness. At the bottom, hooded figures stood bathed in eerie light on a platform surrounded by the void. The figures looked up, introduced themselves as The Guardians of That Which Lies Beyond. They threatened to kill everyone for trespassing, but the Harlem Globetrotters weren't going to stand for that. Then the cultists threw back their hoods to reveal themselves as none other than The Washington Generals, ancient nemesis of the Globetrotters.<br/><br/><i>The Harlem Globetrotters just challenged The Washington Generals, cultists of the Elder Ones, to a game of basketball.</i><br/><br/>A deadly game of basketball broke out, and all seemed lost when Davy Jones of the Monkees summed up mindless powers and infused the Harlem Globetrotters with the powers of death, rendering them unstoppable basketball zombies.<br/><br/>With all the magic and zombies running around, people started failing sanity checks. Soon, Fred had a split personality and believed that he was Daphne. Davy Jones was megalomaniacal, and Shaggy and Scooby were both paranoid. Velma finally figured out that according to the legal papers, the elderly B&amp;B owners were actually the legal owners of not only their own property, but the industrialist's as well. The gang went back to his mansion to inform him, only to find him standing at the door to his study, staring at the eviscerated corpse of his butler, hung from the ceiling by his own entrails.<br/><br/>Davy Jones tried to resurrect the butler to ask him what happened, but failed. Velma, who could also speak German, grabbed the book to try for herself, but when she gazed upon the pages, critically failed her sanity check and became psychotically megalomaniacal. She had a better idea how to figure out what killed the butler.<br/><br/><i>Velma has called forth a Dimensional Shambler to ask it what killed the butler</i><br/><br/>It didn't know.<br/><br/><i>Velma has determined that she is the rightful ruler of the universe. In the empire of Velmania, there shall be no mysteries.</i><br/><br/>In any case, Velma decided that as ruler of the universe, all the property was hers anyway. She went back to the B&amp;B to inform the owners that they could choose to serve her as heralds.<br/><br/>The elderly couple had sacrificed a woman in the final step of the ritual they needed to bring forth the tentacled horrors they had placed into Daphne when they kidnapped her to a place outside of space and time. They did not want to serve Velma, so she sicced her Shambler on them. Davy Jones had gotten his hands on the book again, and was trying to stop the ritual that was calling the horrors out of Daphne, who was writhing on the floor with a shotgun, trying to kill whatever was coming out of her. After the old couple were put down, Velma decided she'd rather have the tentacled things bound to her service than dead. She had the Shambler put Davy Jones of the Monkees down, and took the book back, figuring that she could probably zombify Daphne afterwards and keep her as a herald.<br/><br/><i>Aaand Velma brings the world under her yoke. All hail Velma, immortal God-Queen. The End.</i><br/><br/>So we ended with Davy Jones and the Globetrotters dead; Fred convinced that he was Daphne, babbling to himself in a corner; Daphne zombie herald, mother of Elder Tentacled Things; Shaggy and Scooby hiding in the mystery machine, each convinced that the other is waiting for the right moment to kill them; and Velma, architect of the world's unmaking, and performing the usual end-of-episode Meddling Kid laughter.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277700/#Comment_277700" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T12:03:29+00:00" title="June 24, 2010 12:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
