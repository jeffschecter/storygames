I said that I don't want personified or supernatural demons, to which Joshua responded with the following.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Anarchangel, there's no reason to assume that demons are supernatural in Sorcerer. They don't even have to have personalities. They're powers that either you control or that control you, and the controller needs the controlled to function.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure how this would work mechanically in play. Lets say we have the three characters from <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23387.0" rel="nofollow">the Forge AP thread on <i>carry</i></a>:\n<blockquote>Elmo Smith<br/>- V.C. run ... the ones who don't run are brave V.C.<br/>- shoots out of bloodlust<br/>- the brave V.C. get to die quick<br/><br/>Wendell White<br/>- writes letters every day<br/>- has a girlfriend back home<br/>- all of the above is used as a cover to hide his homosexuality<br/><br/>Tommy Bunting<br/>- never let buddies die (fear)<br/>- won't form lasting relationships, keeps distance<br/>- paranoid: everyone hates him and will get him</blockquote>\nHow would those be turned into demons and how would those demons work during play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151536/#Comment_151536" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T16:50:20+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  4:50PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I'm not entirely sure.  I personally, DON'T recommend turning the supernatural (or at least the fantastic) dial in Sorcerer down to zero.  Joshua is slightly wrong in his interpretation of the game.  The game won't work if the Demon's don't have an agenda and hold the Sorcerer responsible for fulfilling that agenda.  That's what Desire and Need are all about.  That said, if that pressure is represented by the GM playing the whispered doubts in the character's own mind, okay, but the players need to be comfortable with the GM basically narrating their character's thoughts.<br/><br/>Given the above.<br/><br/>Wendell White seems the easiest.  His girlfriend back home is a Passer with Desire: Love and Need: Love Letters.<br/><br/>Elmo Smith might be dealing with some kind of Possessor with Desire for Violence and a Need for .... trophies of some kind maybe?<br/><br/>Tommy Bunting.... Inconspicuous seems the best fit with a Desire for Mayhem and Need for Saving Lives (that one's nastier than it seems because the Sorcerer has to engineer situations in which he can play hero to satisfy the demon).<br/><br/>So.... it CAN work... but I'm not sure I'd recommend it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151552/#Comment_151552" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T21:09:18+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  9:09PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, Jesse, that sounds majorly awesome to me                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151553/#Comment_151553" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T21:11:16+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  9:11PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2008 9:13PM by noclue.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So awesome I double posted.
