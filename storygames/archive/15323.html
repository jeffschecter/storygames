Mostly how the future is going to be even greater for rich (probably white but maybe asian cause that's like a novel twist!) people. Also straight people.

So what you should do in all these situations is identify a core human story.  Like Nathan's AI: it has a big Oedipal issue. Someone who wants to kill their father, cool, that's a thousand different sorts of stories right there.  So now you have some being that wants to kill something that's in his father's place, and you work out why and that's your situation.  Now you can put it in whatever transhumanist or utopian setting you want without it being boring because you already have your conflict cooked up. <br/><br/>If you're looking at a transhumanist situation and saying "wow, that's fucking boring", then you're not looking at it wrong, you're looking at it right.  It's only the humanity acting within the situation, acting as humanity has always and will always act, that allows us to relate to the story and find it interesting.<br/><br/>Unless you're not worried about a story and just looking at what-would-it-be-like-if exploration, which is fine too, in which case if it turns out a little boring, that's okay, because not every "what if" has an interesting answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347906/#Comment_347906" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T21:08:40+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  9:08PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly, I'm looking for interesting ideas about human or otherwise, for splats I'm working on.

What I'd do now, but with different tools and abilities.<br/><br/>I'm a collective group mind, networked but retaining some individuality (the embodiness). Ok. can others join the collective? Does that dilute "me"? What about love? What if one of us has a reaction to a person, feels passion for them, but we're not getting it at group level. How do we feel about love anyway?<br/><br/>Is there prejudice? Maybe I want to get rich so that I can be sure I can always protect my own interests. Trying to get rich fast can't help but breed drama.<br/><br/>I'm an automaton with limited mobility, ok, but what do I want? Do I want mobility? Is that something I care about? Perhaps I want recognition? I'm composing music, but nobody wants to hear music created by a machine. Is there a way I can get it out there, past the prejudice? In the end that's not that different to the challenge facing someone sitting in their bedroom today, the transhuman bit just adds a bit of flavour.<br/><br/>JDCorley is right. The interesting bit isn't the trans bit, that's icing on the cake. It's important. Without it the cake is floury and indigestible. But it's not the core. The core is the humanity.

As such, longlived spokes are also diplomats, weaving together the practices and ideologies of the traditional, egotistical, radical, and mainstream.

Your copy believes itself to be you, so once you are destroyed, who is going to say the copy isn't you?<br/><br/>The best way to make this argument is simply to create a copy of yourself. If you are not both you and your copy at the same time, then voila, no other copy of you is actually going to be you, it will just be you to everyone else. If, on the other hand, exact copies of you are also you, then probably that's an argument in favour of the soul. Which would also be pretty mind-blowing, because then rich people would become terrifying hive-mind armies and their monetary superiority would become flesh.<br/><br/>If the teleporter destroys your molecules and either reassembles them or recreates your body at another spot, then you are exactly right. It's the same issue, and you can just as easily create a copy of yourself as teleport yourself--even easier actually because you don't need to destroy the original. If the teleporter breaks down matter and transports it and then reassembles it, same problem. But if the teleporter actually transports you whole (like your example of a wormhole -- "When I travel, I only ever travel WormWhole<sup>TM</sup>."), then you are still you and not destroyed.<br/><br/>But damn, could you imagine being told that you are teleported whole, and then everybody you know uses the teleporter and then you find out no, it actually destroyes the original and makes a copy at the other end? That would be so fucking creepy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349960/#Comment_349960" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T14:56:43+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  2:56PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2011 3:22PM by stefoid.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite><br/>I dont get the point of backing up your brain in case you die.

If the copying process isnt desctructive for the original, then you have two individual entities.  Obviously they arent the same unique conciousness -- theres two of them!  Now take a gun and shoot the original in the head.  Does that make the copy now the 'same person'?  No, its still a copy and the original conciousness is still dead, whether it was destroyed by the copying process or later with a bullet<br/><br/>Theres a nice sci-fi story in there somewhere.  Someone invents a 'teleporter' and makes a zillion dollars - the big secret is that it is just  a 3D fax that destroys the original.  every individual that gets 'teleported' is actually walking into a suicide box, and a copy walks out a similar box somewhere else.  The even dirtier secret is that the 3D fax process isnt implicitly destructive of the original.  They added a seperate 'destroy' sequence to avoid inconvenient multiplication of the human race.<br/><br/>Maybe some guy gets teleported to work every day (on the moon, say), and his relationship breaks down because his wife grieves for her dead husband and doesnt want anything to do with the copy.

If you walked into the teleporter, it would turn on and your conciousness would end.  Fade to black - dead.  Some short period later, a copy steps out of a box, believing itself to be the original - "hey what do you know?  I didnt die after all - Im still me!".   <br/><br/>Theres a lot of angles to play in this scenario - if the copying process isnt destructive, maybe copies are second class citizens with a time limit, kind of like blade runner, that get sent to do the dirty work in mines or on mars or something.  You could tweak the copy so it doesnt 'last' - it doesnt have to be indentical.  <br/><br/>And if you could do that, then maybe people would tweak themselves to get smarter, stronger, prettier, etc...  Kind of like the most extreme plastic surgery ever - make a 'better' copy of yourself to be your public face, or even more extreme, kill yourself safe in the knoweldge that a better you will carry on your legacy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349970/#Comment_349970" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T15:27:00+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  3:27PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>The best way to make this argument is simply to create a copy of yourself.

I can take other positions, such as object-oriented ontology, and call your low level phenomena overmining and point out the aporias in your value and knowledge system.<br/><br/>That's really boring for me tho.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350091/#Comment_350091" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-30T19:13:55+00:00" title="November 30, 2011  7:13PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orly: pointing to something else is perfectly fine; you just need to start pointing.<br/>Krippler: If you want a copy, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15271&amp;page=1#Item_4" rel="nofollow">here's a link to the alpha version</a>.<br/><br/>Back on the original topic, here are some comments and questions that might help drive the characters.\n<ul><li>In post-scarcity worlds, leisure activities would be a big deal. Art, sports, outdoorsmanship, etc. Not huge fun as a storyline, but good background skills. Competition for social credit could be a big deal, a la <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i> or <i>The Collapsium</i>, driving much of human endeavor. </li>\n<li>In a <i>recently</i> post-scarcity world, there may be a lot of cleanup to do - you might be dealing with people whose endeavors are creating so much waste heat that they're still contributing to global warming.</li>\n<li>Is your group-mind expansionist or non-expansionist? How does it pursue that?</li>\n<li>What threatens your entombed immortal - does it cost a lot of money to live forever? How does he/she get that? Protect it? Are his/her descendants important? Are they hunted down by others? By the immortal? Tad Williams' Otherland series is too long to be a good reference here, but there's a character who fits nonetheless. I've gotten a LOT of mileage out of financially-oriented villains.</li>\n<li>Do your automata have full rights? Do they want them? Do they operate by laws like Asimov's Three? Do they seek to escape them? Are they looked down on? Are they venerated?</li>\n<li>Why is your AI malicious? What makes it hate? What makes it run? Why hasn't it just gotten itself a nice big computer to veg out in? What does it think of the AIs who have one? Does it kill the people it hops into? Does it argue with them?</li>\n<li>Also, transhumans clearly argue about the nature of life and the soul and such. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png"

"Superior knowledge" takes a long time and much hard work to acquire and disseminate; we write articles and books, not pithy one liners. <br/><br/>Although, I kinda took unnecessary umbrage at this:<br/><br/>"Low-level quantum phenomena are absolutely what all matter and energy are made of (I say this as a physicist), so if you're running a truly high-tech game, expect it to matter."<br/><br/>While it's true that at the bottom that's probably what there is, both our understanding of what's going is tenuous and all the the other objects in existent can't really be explained by saying that. And he's appealing to his authority as an expert. Too bad it's in the wrong field for questions of consciousness, society, life, death &amp;c.<br/><br/>I wasn't name dropping to make myself feel superior, I figured you would google that shit if you were interested. The nature of name dropping has changed with google, wikipedia and smartphones; I'm giving you keywords and truncated citations. <br/><br/>If you're honestly interested in Science and Technology (social) Studies, check out Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. It's an absolute classic in the field and a power introduction to the sociology of knowledge. I also suggest following it up with the books of Bruno Latour or Donna Haraway. They're all excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350214/#Comment_350214" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T17:08:42+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  5:08PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See to me name dropping looks like appealing to authority (and attempting to shut down an argument) but a oneliner that contains a tiny part of superior knowledge teases me to investigate. <br/><br/>Using the google it seems Kuhn is a self indulgent prick that would be an absolute bore to read while Haraway seems like she has an actual interest in the world. Which of her books would recommend if I'm interested in other models of consciousness than the one I presented in my posts here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350219/#Comment_350219" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T17:18:47+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  5:18PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See the thing is with scholarship is it doesn't matter what the character of the person is, but rather the content of their ideas.<br/><br/>Start with Kuhn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350262/#Comment_350262" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T01:20:11+00:00" title="December  2, 2011  1:20AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys keep making me think of "The REAL Transported Man" from The Prestige.
