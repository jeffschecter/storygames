Then Jonathan Walton <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=173280" rel="nofollow">pointed out</a> Shreyas' game<i>Mridangam</i> (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1100" rel="nofollow">actual play discussion</a>), from <a href="http://plays-well.com/push1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Push vol 1</a>, which is another dance-based game. Today I searched Story Games for discussions about dancing in games and found <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=66&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">a</a> <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5102&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">couple</a>, but it seems there's not much in this area.<br/><br/><br/>Particularly I saw two distinct ideas in these discussions and games: (1) using dance elements as conflict resolution (all discussion and Mridangam) and (2) using dance elements to guide scene framing and situation (Murderland Road, my own game). It seems to me that (1) emphasizes dance as a mechanism, no much different than dice-rolling. As a crude analogy Mridangam (which I find fascinating and very well designed) gestures are a glorified form of rock-paper-scissors, as the gestures are used for their effects rather than to provide a visual form of storytelling. Murderland Road also has a simplistic posture system and as it requires short movements followed by narration it makes the dancing aspect a poor complement to the storytelling. I think much more than two ways of incorporate dance elements in games exist, also adding them in a cohesive form (without breaking the flow of both dance and story) seems possible, even though it's hard. Anyone here has thoughts on this issue or can knows of other games/discussions that provide different approaches to this issue?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190499/#Comment_190499" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T00:18:56+00:00" title="January 29, 2009 12:18AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mridangam's a lot of good ideas wrapped up in some very bad text, but thank you.</p>\n<p>You might get some mileage out of exploring the ballroom dance concepts of leader/follower.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190541/#Comment_190541" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T10:17:32+00:00" title="January 29, 2009 10:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's always <a href="http://seadracula.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Sea Dracula!</a> which uses dancing as the resolution mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
