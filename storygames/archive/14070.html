Typically, the big reveal is pretty hard to pull off, I think, but since we'd set up this campaign as a mystery ("Why did i0tA get perfect deathed?"), it had to happen at some point.  It went down like this:<br/><br/>The players won a Ghosting challenge against the Aggregate, making themselves appear as if they were still in their workspace, and then got themselves shipped off the station in a small crate, having a sweep deliver them to an sweep maintanance and repair center that orbited around the outside of the donut.  There they encountered Twixlr, the only member of i0tA's former MRCZ that knew the truth behind the conspiracy to kill i0tA and disband the group.<br/><br/>Twixlr says that Pithy, the old MRCZ, stumbled upon the existence of the "fifth spoke" of the station (yes, a Burning Wheel reference), housing the emergency systems that would take over in the event that the station became unsustainable and drastic measures needed to be taken to ensure its survival.  The entire spoke was Ghosted from the perceptions of station inhabitants that were not members of Tier 7 MRCZs with root access. However, the station has been far beyond its design capacity for some time, and the Tier 7s had manually disabled the fifth spoke to allow this continued expansion.  But there is currently a statemate among the Tier 7s, where some leadings MRCZs want to enable the emergency systems but a few groups are blocking this move, not wanting to expell or space half the station's inhabitants.<br/><br/>Pithy's plan was to destroy or permanently disable the fifth spoke, but they had to disband the MRCZ and erase all memories of the plan, except Twixlr's, to prevent the Tier 7s from finding out about the plan and stopping them. They figured that i0tA would investigate his own death (which destroyed his most recent memories) and eventually find out about the plan, but now it's up to him and the new PC MRCZ, Black Lotus, to decide what to do now, since the fewer people who know about it -- at least before the plan in sprung -- and the less it can be traced, the better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318464/#Comment_318464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T11:48:14+00:00" title="April  2, 2011 11:48AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2011 11:53AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Polaris, but mapped to Aztecs &amp; Conquistadors.

What they found was a severed hand that looked a lot like Balls's (one of Dickson's missing working boys), rooted to the dirt by the stump of the wrist and twitching every now and then like a dead frog being hit with electricity. Margrave pokes at it and I offer to let him open his brain to the psychic maelstrom. Matt (Margrave's player) declines, and instead starts pulling on the hand. I describe that it's connected to the earth with a grey/brown root-like structure and it's not easily coming up. Margrave yanks it as hard as he can, so I prompt Matt that he's trying to sieze the thing by force. He agrees, gets a partial hit, and leaves me harm to give. I decide instead to make him miss something:<br/><br/>As he pulls the hand out of the ground, the root structure resists and is yanked up and the pressure releases a plume of spores that makes everyone hack and cough and hide their eyes. As he yanks the hand the last bit of the way out of the dirt, a fist-sized leathery sack that glows with a green bioluminescence pops out and the hand is free. The sudden loss of tension causes him to fall and crush the pod under his knee without realizing it. The fluid inside the sac dissolves into his skin, leaving no trace. The hand is dead, all the twitching gone after that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318933/#Comment_318933" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T16:03:32+00:00" title="April  5, 2011  4:03PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World in Philaros' Fantasy Seattle Setting.

I sense tension, but perhaps both could be true?<br/><br/>Playing this game on a giant white-board table is ... awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320048/#Comment_320048" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-11T14:12:16+00:00" title="April 11, 2011  2:12PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I closed out the Apocalypse World game I was MCing, as one of our players is going to be on parental gaming leave for the next few months. <br/><br/>We got some nice closure - the PCs had all gone off in their own directions, and there was a great deal of hostility and violent history between them all.

First one was a gore fest that took place in the androgynous Col. Ling-Lang's hardhold, a former Kmart that housed their gang of PC's. Their market goods were prostitutes and grain. It ended in a firefight with a chopper gang, who they obliterated of course. Poor Tum-Tum was tossed out as bait, but, to be fair, he did burn down half the complex.<br/><br/>2nd AW game was a little more intimate, involving a troubled battle babe in love with the skinner who was being used as a boy-toy by the chopper who was somewhat of a leather daddy. All kinds of gender bending and gay relationships in this one. The skinner finally became one of the gang by getting one over on Rothschild, the guy their chopper gang owed a debt to and who had come to collect. It ended with the skinner getting his own bike, the battle babe having a real loving sexual encounter despite her reservations, and the chopper getting the goods from Rothschild and clearing their debt. Rothschild became my new favorite NPC, a british gentleman in a 3 piece suit, black hair, writes poetry, kind of a dandy.<br/><br/>Also a Fiasco cyberpunk hack my friend wrote that was hilarious good times. My character was a razorgirl who had the relationship: malfunctioning cyborg to my neighbor's corporate saboteur and the need: to blow things up to get back at the man. There were 3 androids/robots in the party as well, who were fighting for the equal marriage act between synthetics and humans.

Olympias played some Chinese chess with her awesome grandpa, but then had to borrow his sword-cane to kill her crewmate Franky's dead brother, who was throttling poor Franky. Olympias ended up setting the campsite on fire somehow, in the process, and traded back the rest of the ghost dust to Freeman, the biker dealing it. <br/>Next day, a Driver named Jag shows up, on Vegas the Hardholder's account, to decide who's in charge of the refugees before they get to The Wreck. Jag once left Olympias to the crocs, but he doesn't know she hates him real real bad (and she doesn't know his front seat covers are made from ex-wife leather. Serious ick.), so when she cooks him breakfast, and then spikes it with ghost dust, he's taken unawares.<br/>That afternoon, when the refugees get to The Wreck, Jag wrangles 'em with his Hummer right up close to Vegas' top men, and the two groups throw words back and forth before opening fire (shooting to incapacitate, not to kill). <br/>The biker gang with the ghost dust does a deal on the other side of the ship while this is going down, and then we all hear shots fired, and then everybody not working for Vegas is now being held by Vegas.<br/>The refugees, aside from my crew, are gonna end up hooked on dust and living in the radioactive, moldy, dark, dank underbelly of the ship. I am not happy about this. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Vegas has a crush on Olympias from when he was an itty wittle boy. So it won't go all that badly. Hopefully.<br/>Did I mention that a Quarantine powersuit soldier from the Old Days is part of Vegas' crew? He just kind of showed up on the ship one day (the ship can sort-of comfortably fit 2000 people, so it's big. REAL big) and no one yet knows about where he came from. He isn't telling anyone about the capsule he came out of, either, or his static crewmates still in hypersleep or whatever. <br/>Vegas is kind of a Mussolini or a Gaddafi figure. He overthrew the previous regime here, and now he rules with a sufficiently iron fist. He uses a gibbet, too - very old school torture style. But he helped out me (Olympias) from getting shot during the coup, and now I'm back, so I intend to move in on this territory and shape him up, make him a person again.

Peter needs to get out of this arranged marriage, being unattracted to the willowy girl and having a taste for buxom tavern wenches.<br/><br/><b>Paris </b>and <b>Peter </b>are bastard sons, by different mothers, of Sir Walter Raleigh. Peter needs to lay with his one true love; Paris thinks his love is Getrude, and he's constantly tryuing to push them into each other's arms.<br/><br/>Young <b>Peter </b>is a boy player at the Rose Theater, and muse to the playwright <b>Geoffrey Kempe</b>--Peter's true love. Peter knows of letters from Sir Raleigh in his mother's possession, which Geoffrey covets, so he says, that he may write an epic work of forbidden love and bastard offspring.<br/><br/><b>Geoffrey </b>and <b>Hugh </b>are agents of a foreign power, having been offered the coin they desperately need in return for exposing Her Majesty Elizabeth's plans to their French contact Anton...including a ciphered letter containing state secrets which is among Peter's mother's letters.<br/><br/><i>The Tilt:</i><br/><br/>Upon learning that Paris has not consummated with his daughter, and is furthermore sowing his oats and breaking her heart, he confronts the youth. Under pressure he gives up the secret of the bastard parentage..of  his half-brother Peter. Realizing what danger he's put Peter in, he sobers up, returns to Hugh's house and murders him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter obtains the letter from his mother's room. Geoffrey is delighted, tells the admiring lad that this will be the seed of a tale for the ages, and that fortunes will soon rise...for both of them. Geoffrey takes Peter in his arms, and they make love, leaving Peter swooning while Geoffrey sets to work on his schemes.<br/><br/><i>The Aftermath:</i><br/><br/>In the wake of his death, Hugh's "business associate" Anton calls on the family, takes poor Gertrude "away from all this" to France, where he sells her to a brothel. Hugh's wife settles into a lonely life sponging off kin.<br/><br/>After ignominiously dodging the vengeful Geoffrey's manful challenge, Paris is distraught over the mess he made of things, and kills himself. He can't bring himself to do it by his own hand, and so switches the lead actor's stage dagger with a real one.<br/><br/>Peter's heart is nearly crushed when Geoffrey seems to care more for his inscrutable quest than their love--but the playwright comes to his senses, abandons the mission and runs away with Peter to France. Their love frays, though, when the money gets tight, and Peter goes to the authorities and accuses Geoffrey of sodomy, putting him on the run. Peter never loves again.<br/><br/>Geoffry, harried, fugitive and melancholy, finds his drunken reverie interrupted by the steady footsteps and calm voice of Anton: "We had an arrangement, Monsieur Kempe. You have not upheld your end of the bargain." It's the gallows for Geoffrey!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320980/#Comment_320980" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T13:10:59+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  1:10PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World first session!

The core mechanic is amazing: you hold a bunch of Fudge dice in your fist and pop them out on the table, one at a time, with your thumb.  "BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!!!" Sound effects are required.<br/><br/>We shot up a bunch of alien dudes who walked like crabs and threw invisible crystalline spines. We adopted an orphaned Korean tourist kid at the Space Needle and taught him how to shoot.  Then, with his help (he killed 3 crab dudes by himself!) we rescued a bunch of people who were being kidnapped by the aliens for unknown purposes before getting TOTALLY DESTROYED by the mini-boss, a power-armored giant alien who speared Jackson's character through the chest with a huge invisible spine-sword.  We ended up quitting from fatigue -- we got started late -- before being able to battle the alien queen.<br/><br/>There's a lot of good in this game and I'm excited to see what Andy does with it at this point.  We gave him some extensive feedback about form factor stuff like how to make the character sheets and play aids more usable, as well as how to make some of the special moves and gear more compelling.  But I would play it again in a heartbeat, even without any changes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320987/#Comment_320987" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T15:00:03+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  3:00PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night we played some <a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/index.php/archives/2058" rel="nofollow">Lucid</a>, the Inception hack of Jenga-Dread.  I played the Point Man, as a post-Scientology Tom Cruise who'd traded his extremely public lifestyle for the more private but equally lucrative world of dream-thievery ("People dream about celebrities all the time; I blend in perfectly.").  We might have gone a little too meta in our choice of architecture; the dream was a flashback to our mark's younger, nerdier days at an MMO guild meet-up/LARP (the definitions of exactly what we were doing became more fluid as the dream went on), and we were convincing him to hand over the recipe for his pharmaceutical firm's new, highly illegal drug by defining it as a monster's rare drop he needed to trade to his guildies<br/><br/>I've never actually played the base game before, but I enjoyed it, especially the very tactile and stressful feedback with the wobbly tower.  I think this hack works well for a very short pickup game; we spent maybe half an hour answering the questionnaires and then gave ourselves an hour in real time to finish before the kick, and the tower fell right at the ten minute warning.  It seems a little harsh to have knocking down the tower end the whole job instead of just taking out one person; there is the option to reset the tower by going one level deeper into the dream, but that wasn't an option for us since the Chemist has to do it and ours sold us out to the mark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321006/#Comment_321006" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T16:04:16+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  4:04PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2011 4:05PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our Polaris hack streak continues.

The former personal assistant to the deceased.  Married to <b>James</b>.  The preserved human fetus in a jar of formaldehyde is an issue between them.  We never figured out why there was a preserve human fetus (etc.) involved.  <br><br><b>James Aberforth</b>.  A doctor.  He and <b>Archibald</b> are murderer and accomplice (while the implication was strong, we never actually figured out who they murdered).  Needs to Get In To The Mansion.  <br><br><b>Archibald Curry</b>.  Formerly the gardener for Worthington Manor.  For some also unexplained reason, the graveyard keeps coming up between him and <b>Serena</b>.  <br/><br/>The police and mayor's office were onto Dr. Aberforth for altering some lab results, thanks to his blabbermouth medical assistant and her blabbermouth sister, who worked in the mayor's office.  Dr. Aberforth found this out thanks to a friendly cop (Sgt. Flannery).  <br/><br/>Dr. Aberforth and Archibald the gardener were hatching a scheme to tunnel their way into the mansion in order to clean it out.  <br/><br/><i>The Tilt:</i><br/><br/>The doc's paranoia gets the better of him.  He attempts to drug his dear wife (who has apparently failed to tell him she just found out she was lactose intolerant).  He and Archibald complete their tunnel into the mansion.  Archibald brains hapless Bianca the maid with his shovel (who unfortunately passed away due to brain swelling).  James is surprised by Serena, who tells him he could have just come to her for the keys (this was suspiciously easy).  His paranoia comes to the fore, and he chloroforms her.  Archibald stuffs her in a closet.  <br/><br/>Just then the cops arrive, loudspeakers blaring "We know you're in there.  Come out with your hands up!"  Dr. Aberforth jumps off of a back balcony, forgetting that he'd left his wife.  Archibald goes back for her and throws her (!!!) off the balcony to her loving husband, waiting to catch her.  He catches her wrong, snapping his left leg at the knee.  Fortunately she seems to have survived the landing ok.  Unfortunately, not so much the chloroform attempt; I grabbed a black die for myself as I narrated how he'd actually gotten the cloth lodged in her nose and mouth, which meant she was without oxygen for a critical few minutes.  Meanwhile, as Curry the gardener attempts to knock himself unconscious inside the closet, in an attempt to deflect suspicion, he actually triggers the secret passage down to the basement, and the collapsing tunnel.  <br/><br/><i>The Aftermath:</i><br/><br/>Archibald Curry is trapped underground for five days.  Clawing his way out, he ends his days psychotic and homeless on the streets, living in a cardboard box.  No one comes near him for his "treasures", which he'd managed to load up on before he left the mansion, and which could have bought him a nice life if he weren't psychotically attached to them.  He dies on the streets aged 52.  <br/><br/>Dr. James Aberforth loses the leg.  He spends a long time in prison, for murdering the poor Bianca as well as for causing his wife's brain damage.  When he gets out he is forever barred from the medical profession.  After attempting to contact his wife he is told by her family that if he tries to see her no one will ever find his body.  <br/><br/>Serena Aberforth spends the rest of her life institutionalized.  It's years before she can do more than babble and drool.  Eventually she recovers enough to be able to draw pretty pictures with crayons and talk about her husband, who "loves me very much and will be here soon to take me home."  She lives a long life and eventually dies in institution, waiting for her husband.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321408/#Comment_321408" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T00:14:22+00:00" title="April 21, 2011 12:14AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Anima Prime.</b>  I made them fight warangutans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321416/#Comment_321416" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T05:56:14+00:00" title="April 21, 2011  5:56AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><b>Anima Prime.</b>I made them fight warangutans.</blockquote>\nOh yeah, I ran some AP last week.

The two tenderpaws seem to be particularly withdrawn and emo and their mentors try to direct them, to little avail. They reach a flooded vale and Patrol Leader (and Oldfur) Kynes directs an effort to build a watercraft. Young Wilfred will have none of that and boldly climbs the trees for a better look; he wasn't paying close enough attention and fell quite a distance injuring his leg.<br/><br/>The patrol hurriedly scuttles, with injured Tenderpaw in tow, across the flood waters to warn Copperwood. They arrive to see the townsmice setting up for the celebration, amongst them Dorf ( a rival for Wilfred and the elder patrol mouse, Edmund). Dorf is more concerned with getting a rise out of Edmund and Wilfred and making things harder for them then saving the town, but cool heads and reasoning win the day through some deft arguments made by Kynes, Edmund and (even) Wilfred. The Vernalstar Festivities are suspended until the floodwaters pass.<br/><br/>While they wait, Clove the Tenderpaw sets out to ease the townsmice spirit by baking her famous Ivydale bread. Does the accolades that she attract bring with it some unwanted jealousy?<br/><br/>Wilfred, still pissed at Dorf, goes to the local tavern to pick a fight and....Wins?

The Brainers brain relay was a giant antenna visible from anywere in the hardhold. It was feared and the use of tinfoil hats (delusion threat) was widespread and that's why the Brainer had 5 barter to start with. It would have been fun in a longer campaign to have the Brainer realize that even though the tinfoil hats don't work sooner or later the populationj would rise up not fearing the antenna and the only way for the Brainer to retain control would be to get the damage moves to be able to hurt gangs or stop the delusion and his own business.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hardholder BBQ-Vega tasked with punishing a young thief came up with the brilliant idea of having a wheel of fortune of punishments.

The Queen of the Windcatchers (religious enclave living in the Sydney Opera house) had ambitions to rule all of Sunken Sydney and was setting up a deal with Madface the Oildriller (give us fuel and we won't blow your fucking head off) and proposing marriage with BBQ-Vega (with his hold as Dowry). The players in turn set up a deal for unlimited fuel from Madface as long as it went into a war effort versus the Windcatchers and with very cunning setup and a good manipulation roll managed to set the wedding party in their own hardhold, explain that BBQ-Vega was to recieve the queens land as Dowry instead and siezed the kiss from the bride by force while the driver ran his armored hovercraft into the crowd of wedding guests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother cool thing was that just as the players entered the Opera house temple to visit the Queen some people starting playing violin in the room next to us and ended right when the scene ended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321693/#Comment_321693" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T07:15:39+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  7:15AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard<br><br>Grain Peddler mission from the book.

Tired, injured, or angry I can definitely see, but generally you don't get more than 1 (or max 2) conditions at a time. Compromises generally mean compromises to the (purely fictional, not mechanical) stakes set before the conflict starts.  So if the hooded mice wanted to kill the guardmice, but turned out to not be able to, then the guardmice could be "left for dead" somewhere instead of killed outright.  Like, the hooded mice could have left them injured in the woods, to be eaten by a predator, since maybe one of their own was injured and they had to withdraw. Or they could have driven the guardmice back into a dangerous location (some other animal's nest, perhaps) and trapped them there.  Something like that.  Giving everybody all the conditions at once... of course that's going to suck.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321725/#Comment_321725" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T11:47:06+00:00" title="April 25, 2011 11:47AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [MG #2]<br><br/>That's what the rule-book says to do.

She hurls accusations at Billy, who escapes to Jack's Roadhouse, where he sees a bunch of his old high school friends.  Suzie's twin sister Regina is there, pregnant again, ignoring her alcoholic boyfriend Bubba.  She comes on to strong to Billy, who tries to extricate himself, only to run into Andrew, who had followed Billy to the bar.  Andrew and Billy tie one on.  Andrew convinces Billy to stay in town past the funeral, and come to a party in the dump/ravine out behind Andrew's house (and the hotel).  A drunk Billy takes Regina back to the hotel, where Sadie spies on her "bad" daughter's futile attempts to get Billy to rise to the occasion.  The next day a hung-over Billy attends the funeral, officiated over by Pastor Jim.  Everybody's there: Sadie, Andrew, Suzie.  Sadie talks about being at Brenda's bedside the night she died.  Andrew conspires with Sadie to teach Billy a lesson at the ravine party.  Later that night, Andrew goes to a local pig farmer to try to get some blood a la "Carrie".  Sadly, things don't go very well, and he's forced to flee the farmers, leaving his truck.<br/><br/>Tilt: Innocence: love rears its ugly head, and Tragedy: confusion followed by pain.<br/><br/>At the ravine party, Andrew manages to get Billy tied to the altar, but his plan to just humilate Billy goes horribly awry as Sadie stabs the helpless man, and Regina is accidently pushed over, hitting her head on a rock.  Most of the party-goers flee while Andrew rushes Regina to the hospital.  Left alone, Sadie threatens to kill Billy, but instead he convinces her to go be with her only remaining daughter.  A bleeding Billy staggers to the Pastor Jim's house, and is taken to the same hospital as Regina.  Sadie sneaks into Billy's hospital room, and poisons his IV, just the way she did Brenda's, knowing his aunt's death would bring Billy back to town.  Regina regains consciousness, and Andrew proclaims his love for her.  <br/><br/>Aftermath: Five years later, Andrew lives a happy life as husband to Regina and father to her rmany children, holding barbecues in the ravine.  Billy was saved from dying, but is left a drooling husk, sitting by the empty hotel pool in his wheelchair.  His last scene is one of Andrew's children offering him a grilled burger.  Meanwhile, Sadie's appeals have run out, and she faces execution with no one by her side.  But wait, who is that mysterious woman in the gallery as they give her the lethal injection?  Could it be..."Suzie?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322388/#Comment_322388" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T10:53:12+00:00" title="April 30, 2011 10:53AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard<br/>Spring 1153 (3rd Session)<br/><br/>Clove has given away all of her freshly baked Ivydale Bread to delighted Vernalstar revelers when she is approached by two baker mice, Old Rue and her corpulent nephew Hammond. They try to subtly impress on Clove that her bread baking has no place in Copperwood but the subtly is lost on the dense tenderpaw. They harangue her with more force, even going so far as to "sequester" Clove to talk inside. Finally, Clove has had enough and promises not to sell (or give away) anymore bread in Copperwood without their okay.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, tenderpaw Wilfred has woken up in the hoosegow after being arrested for public drunkenness and fighting. His rival, Dorf, is in the cell next to him. Wilfred's mentor Brandt visits him and though the sheriff will release him into the Guard's custody, thinks it's better for the young mouse to learn a lesson and cool his head in jail. But that means missing the annual Copperwood trailblazing competition (and a chance to humiliate Dorf). The rival pays his own bail, but Wilfred has to call in some favors as he doesn't want his parents to know he spent the night in the slammer. <br/><br/>Oldfur Kynes makes it to the Trailblazing Competition on the outskirts of Copperwood as Dorf and Wilfred are limbering up. The contest features a wild dash across the wilderness to a series of hidden flags and back to town. Dorf mocks the mice, but is forced to eat his words when they soundly defeat him. Kynes later proposes a drinking contest where he, once again shows the young mice how it's done and Dorf is left vomiting on the floor of the tent.<br/><br/>Stalwart patrol mouse Edmund is taken aback by how the town guard seems to have a lackadaisical attitude towards their duties, confronting a group of guards who throw dice against a wall. He impresses upon them the importance of vigilance but it mostly falls on deaf ears, so he starts patrolling the streets himself. This doesn't sit well with the fiercely independent (and in some cases, belligerently drunk) mice of Copperwood. He is harassed in the streets by a particularly sloshed couple who damn near wake up the neighborhood with their screaming. But Edmund stays true to the stone grey of his cloak and is not moved by their onslaught. Eventually, the drunks wander off into the night.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, sharp eyed Brandt is watching the younglings play on the outskirts of the festivities when one of them warns that a monster's coming! A panic seems to come up through the crowd but the guard springs to action. Brandt recognizes it as a newt, likely swept into the area by the recent flood and attracted by the heat of the town torches. Quickly, Brandt pulls one such torch from the ground and tries to lead the beast away from the town. Emboldened Wilfred throws himself inbetween the Newt and the town and menacingly brandishes his weapon while Edmund moves around to flank, ensuring that the newt will follow the torch. Kynes calms the panicking mice and, with the menace now cleared, the Vernalstar celebrations conclude without further incident.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14070/bite-size-ap-april-2011" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14070/bite-size-ap-april-2011" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14070/bite-size-ap-april-2011/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14070%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14070%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
