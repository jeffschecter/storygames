<p>So, here we are developing games that are lean and tight and loaded with gleaming teeth.</p>
<p>But so many of them ring flat for me. I can't explore and enjoy these systems; there are no knobs to turn, no levers or dials. I really, <em>really</em> like mechanically differentiating players' abilities in customisable ways. I really, <em>really</em> like mechanics that produce sharp, focused, player-driven action.</p>
<p>But mysteriously, I've never seen these two strategies working together. There're embryonic forms, like Keys, but these are like d&amp;d2's nonweapon proficiencies. Where are the 3e feats? Why can't I mess with the Fanmail economy, or do weird timing things with Trust?</p>
<p>I have suspicions about this, but I don't want to sling them around too soon here. I'd kind of feel like I was flaming for no sensible reason.</p>

                            I'm not [i]entirely[/i] sure what Shreyas means, but I think we wants more than that.  Like, D&amp;D allows you to customize your setting--but it also allows massive fidgety jibberjabber with feats, spells, etc.  Exalted, from what I gather, also has fidgety stuff with Charms.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like what he wants is super fidgety jibber-jabber as applied to "story structure."  Like, "The girlfriend can't break up with my character, because I took the Immunity to Plot Twists feat with a sub-specialization in girlfriend issues."<br/>
<br/>
(Shreyas, is that approximately correct?)<br/>

                            Shreyas: Yes!<br/>
<br/>
(Err, yes to what I think you're saying, at least).<br/>
<br/>
I'm one of the people who spent, lord, hundreds of hours tinkering with the crunchy character and vehicle design systems in things like GURPS, Car Wars, Battletech, etc. etc. Now, 99 percent of that never translated into Actual Play with other real live people -- it was "lonely fun," the geek equivalent of crossword puzzles.* But fun it was.<br/>
<br/>
And I also love the new streamlined, all-out, pedal-to-the-floor Story Now, Now, Now -- PTA, Dogs, etc. But, like Shreyas, I sometimes look at the character sheets and go, "y'know, mechanically, all these guys are basically the same, and we're imagining the differences on top, like GM and Oldsmobile putting different bodies over the same chassis and engine."<br/>
<br/>
So how can we put the crunchy, fiddly fun in harness alongside the fast-playing, Story Now fun?<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that really clicks for me, actually, is that little "d4 trait" thing in Dogs.** It's the opposite of the "different description, identical mechanics" problem that bugged me above: Instead, you can have the exact same description and then have it behave differently in the mechanics -- which then feeds back to radically change its meaning in the story.<br/>
<br/>
The only Dogs game I've ever gotten to play (weep for me!), the GM had the town's Steward in a minor social conflict with us, and he had the Steward roll the trait, "Steward - 2d4." And the other player and I went, "He has 'Steward' as a d4 trait! This town is in trouble!"<br/>
<br/>
All from one little number after the "d." Not pages and pages of tables, not tons of feats each one with special cases, not an enormous cross-referenced grid on my character sheet. Just "d4," and it's all we need to know. That's brilliant. I want more of that.<br/>
<br/>
* And when those super crunchy systems did actually get played, they were usually cumbersome and disappointing, but that's just poor design-craft, not an inherent quality of crunch. Let's all assume we're going to be designing GOOD games.<br/>
<br/>
** For people who don't know Dogs, characters' traits are rated both in the number of dice they give you to roll and the TYPE of dice (d4, d6, d8, d10). Lots of small dice may roll the same total in a conflict as a single large die, but the "Fallout" you take (damage, injury, enforced change to your character) depends on the NUMBER of dice rolled, so small dice, and especially d4s, are more likely to get your character chewed up even if s/he wins. I'm totally stealing this system for my own Ronnies entry....                        </div>

                            Ages ago I made a post on my livejounal about a story game that would harness the "tinkertoy" aspect of systems like D&amp;D and Exalted for good narative purpose. I think Kirt (Xiombarg) was trying to integrate something similar into his anime inspired game.<br/><br/>Basically, it was like TSOY Keys and secrets that you chained together into paths (like charm trees in Exalted) and each tree was a particular kind of story structure that you want to explore. Almost like a more structured version of Nine Worlds muses, in fact.<br/><br/>-Matt                        </div>

<b>Nine Worlds!</b><br/>
Seriously the game to look at for this. Muses, point-spending, Locks, all that suff? Man, there is an amazing little strategy game in there. It really appeals to me because it's almost all in-the-moment decision-making, rather than front-loaded chargen stuff, which I usually find boring.<br/>
<br/>
But I feel ya, Shreyas. I loves me some good dials and knobs in a game. I think something like Key-trees (and Secret-trees) would be a cool next step. Must think on this some more.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I like that 'tinker-toy' aspect too.  There is a big difference, though, between games where you do it beforehand (D&amp;D, Champions, Burning Wheel), and where you fiddle tihings with during the game (which is what Nine Worlds seems to do).<br>
<br>
Shreyas--thought about doing this with those graphical character sheets?  Working out ways in which characters can be built with different 'stations' and with different 'paths' between them?  That'd be super-neat.                        </br></br></div>

</div></blockquote>
<p>Bluntly, I think this move toward simpler is overcorrection and factionalisation.</p>
<p>I mean, combat is: opponent + stick sharp things in + take their stuff. And yet, it has been made mechanically and descriptively interesting.</p>
<p>We've done baroque and we know that now. We've done simple and we know that now. I would like to believe we're getting over both those phases now, and have the craft to make systematically, elegantly complex systems.</p>
<p>We <em>can</em> make things more complicated: Suppose a game where you can flag any character with "Trusted" or "Distrusted." Suppose that it has some kind of hanfway interesting conflict system, as Dogs or HQ. This gives you a crazy world of mechanical hooks to hang neat idiosyncratic mechanics off.</p>
<p>In the world of fiddly chargen tricks, you can make <strong>Trust Intervenes</strong>; with this power, someone who you Trust can pre-empt your action in conflict to do something. You can make <strong>Trust Restores</strong>; when someone you Trust moves to assist you, it replenishes your resource reserves. And so on. Made with craft and attention, this design stuff changes the pattern of choices you get to make mment-to-monent in play, or (as with the mechanics I've described) influences the way others make choices. That's what I want.</p>
<p>Piers, I have thought about that. Eventually I'll come back to it and talk about it.</p>

                            For my "Enemies" game, I was considering that in character creation you should have every key to the design of your particular "enemy."  If you took a flaw like, "Scared of the dark," your enemy should be "powerful in the dark."  If you took a strength like, "Ambidextrous Fighting," your enemy should have multiple attacks/arms.  Of course, my "Enemies" game is a closed small-session game where you _can_ directly connect such things.  My "hates pink" quirk isn't worth a point unless it comes up in the game, darnit.                        </div>

                            What's interesting here--correct me if I'm wrong, Shreyas!--is that what's being asked for is an Exploration of System emphasis in a Narrativist game.  Which means you need a system that can be hacked, tweaked, optimized, and basically "power-gamed" to focus on themes and story structure.  (Not that one *should* power-game with it, but that such a thing would be possible.)<br>
<br/>
If that's what's under discussion, it's a tall order.  Important themes, and powerful stories, probably resist that kind of dissection.  But it's an interesting idea.<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas, have you looked at "My Life with Master"?  I'm not too familiar with it, but from what I can tell it's meant to describe a very formulaic story.  I'd suggest figuring out how it does that... and then see if you can hack it up or add power-gamey elements to it... and then adapt that to some other genre.                        </br></div>

<p>Really, why do you think so?</p>
<p>Parenthetically, I do not care about themes. Until I actually have a clear understanding of what themes are, they are getting in my way. I'm actually much more interested in pacing and structure in a more general sense.</p>

                            Turning a story into a mechanical process would be difficult in part because what's really happening in a story, structurally, is often very hard to spot.  (Or at least, I've thought so when I've tried to do it.)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that what makes a *good* story is probably something intangible, but I might be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to do it, I'd think in terms of Sympathy (or Identification), which has a relationship both with hardship and with great performance.  I'd also base the maximum amount of "story damage" based on the scene number, so that the stakes mechanically get higher and higher as play goes on.                        </div>

                            I think James' last response pretty much sums up how I feel. <br/>
<br/>
I think that playing with the system just would distract from 'what matters' in story play. I've been struggling with this same agenda conflict for years though. Through my recent play in an online Buffy game and many homebrew creations discarded, I've come to the conclusion that (for me) most conventional ways of defining characters just get in the way of 'what matters'.                        </div>

                            Hey, I'm not saying it's not worth attempting, I just think it would be hard.  Still, stories are funky things, and figuring out how they work has far broader implications that role-playing games.    <br/>
<br/>
There must be a couple of good books about "how to write," which could be mined for mechanical ideas.  Based on some of those books I read in high school, everything in them is a truism--but there's some value in seeing it made explicit.                        </div>

                            Whose hands should these tools be in, and in what form should they be?<br/>
I've had issues with my own fantasy rpg for a while with fate, I want fate (as an active thing, since the game is based on Celtic hero tales loosely, and Anglo Saxo ones as well) where Fate comes up and bites the pc's on the proverbial arse end--but whose tool is it? Initially I put it in their hands, mostly leaving it for them to decide when it was optioned and built up towards a doom state, and fate rising up against them. That right there is a fiddly bit, is that what your speaking of?                        </div>

                            I agree with Shreyas - I want a character sheet that slides and moves - locks and spins.  I want traits and chains and relationships that slip around and connect and disconnect.  A character sheet that comes in six parts that you draw out of a hat and piece together like a puzzle.  A character sheet that's two-sided and folds like origami to reveal new mechanics.<br/><br/>Does it take away from 'telling the story'?  Not if the character sheet is a literal reflection of the character's journey.  Not if it works thematically.  How about a Hellraiser game that has character sheets that fold into cubes?  And when the cube is finished, so's your character.<br/><br/>Really, all of these things are metaphors - and the system can be just as thematic in how it behaves as the rules that make up the system.  There's this idea that a system has to sit very still and be very quiet in a narrative game, or else it'll accidentally tip over the story and smash it on the floor.<br/><br/>If your story your game tells is that fragile, it probably deserved it.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>To put it another way, <i>Star Wars</i> is a story about a farm boy who goes to war.  It's the color that makes all the difference.  Color for system instead of color for setting.                        </div>

                            I guess I could vaguely define 'what matters' as player choice and its consequence in the imagined space, if we want vague definitions. Then I'd say vaguely that knobs and dials exist to empower or disempower the player/character at any given time, and this has a constraining effect on player choice. Speaking vaguely ;)                        </div>

This fear, I think, has been supported by stuff like White Wolf's articulation of the Golden Rule: if you don't like the mechanics, don't use them.  This also means "don't blame the designer."<br/>
<br/>
That's just fear: fear that their system won't tell the kinds of stories they want to tell, fear that, the way they designed it, it will tell stories that the designer never intended it to tell, stories that are "bad" or "boring."  So you need the players to have Line Item Veto and be ready to step in and rescue the story from an imperfect system.<br/>

Personally, Shreyas, of all the crazy indie designers I know, I think you are the least afraid of mechanics and also the least interested in touchy-feely hippie freeform lets-all-get-along stuff.  I think this is your opportunity for real leadership in making this shit happen.                        </div>

<p>Hehe. Somewhat true. I do prefer the slightly less touchy, slightly less freeform, "Look, if we get along life will go better for the both of us." Freeform is the same thing as the GR, "don't blame the designer," but in this case it's 'cause he didn't actually do anything.</p>
