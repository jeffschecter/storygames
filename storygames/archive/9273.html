I still think it's a nice idea and maybe it'll catch on here.<br/><br/>Bascially what this thread is supposed to be is a sort of chain-thread where everyone comes up with a challenge or Dilemma that can not be solved by any amount of Violence. It works like this: The poster prior to you writes down the name of a movie or novel which is supposed to be a springboard for your inspiration. You take that name and - for whatever reason (plot, the title, a character, a scene...) - come up with a roleplaying situation, challenge or dilemma that can not be solved by violence. This could be either because it's flat out impossible to beat the problem into submission or because gratuitous violence will only help to make the situation worse. These challenges could be from any genre (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror...) regardless of the genre of the movie.<br/><br/>The important things to write down though are answers to the three following questions:<br/><br/>What's the Dilemma?<br/>Why doesn't Violence solve it?<br/>What possible solutions exist?<br/><br/>After writing your challenge just come up with another movie or novel title for the next poster.<br/><br/>My example:<br/><br/><b>The Karate Kid</b><br/>What's the Dilemma?<br/>It's a sports competition or tournament with a prize (respect, money, the hand of whomever) that you yearn for, when your mentor/trainer/the owner of the team comes to ask you for a favor. The mentor/trainer/owner of the opponent(s) is and he are old and bitter rivals and he is focused on winning against them - even more, he wants to humiliate and destroy them. To do so he asks you to do a highly illegal move that could very well cost you your career and your opponent his life or lifelyhood. However if you do not comply you might lose respect in the eyes of you mantor, get kicked off the team or even make your mentor an enemy.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Violence solve it?<br/>Violence won't solve anything because beating the "opponent" is the problem in itself. Of course going up against your mentor isn't such a good idea either, because he might be better than you (he's your mentor for a reason) or because you do rely on his continued teaching.<br/><br/>What possible solutions exist?<br/>You could try to convince your mentor that his actions will not hurt those he wants to hurt, but directly affect innocents.<br/>You could give up your quest for the prize and fail in an earlier round.<br/><br/>Alright, and now the movie title for the next poster:<br/><br/><b>The Watchmen</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206327/#Comment_206327" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T12:22:10+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 12:22PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2009 12:24PM by David Artman.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the Dilemma?<br/>The local populous is terrified by some event, and there is rioting in the streets. You are sent in to contain the riot... and, incidentally, to learn about the terrifying event.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Violence solve it?<br/>The populous is under your aegis; if you just start killing and maiming, you've failed your very reason for being sent in the first place (i.e. anyone can just send in the jackbooted thugs and open fire; you're supposed to DEFUSE the situation). And the risk is greater if you apply non-lethal violence (e.g. riot cops with truncheons and shields), as it is less than reliable and could take a riot into out-right revolution, by providing a focus to the mob's inchoate rage.<br/><br/>What possible solutions exist?<br/>Oratory or persuasion, ideally of the worst of the demagogues in the crowd, who have a modicum of influence over the mob.<br/>Provide another focus for the mob's rage, somehow.<br/>Cleverly channel the mob into  places where they can do little harm to themselves or property.<br/>Something extreme, like AoE magic or super-tech that negates emotions. Ah, but you have to first GET that stuff ready, as the city burns....<br/><br/><b><i>Reservoir Dogs</i></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206342/#Comment_206342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T12:45:13+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 12:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2009 12:48PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>If you fucking beat this prick long enough, he'll tell you he started the goddamn Chicago fire, now that don't necessarily make it fucking so</i>. - Nice Guy Eddie<br/><br/>What's the dilemma?<br/>You need information out of a dude in your custody.<br/><br/>Why doesn't violence solve it?<br/>Violence will just get you bad information, a dead dude, or both.<br/><br/>What possible solutions exist?<br/>You could ask nicely.<br/>You could trick it out of him.<br/>You could build rapport, and then establish that your interests aligned and that it is in his best interest to tell you.<br/>You could set up a situation with independent verification, using violence as the failure state.<br/><br/><b>Unforgiven</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206383/#Comment_206383" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T14:54:25+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  2:54PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the dilemma?<br/>You need money to feed your family.<br/><br/>Why doesn't violence solve it?<br/>Because you only have a family in the first place because you renounced violence and reformed yourself into a different, better person.<br/><br/>What possible solutions exist?<br/>Rebuild your relationships with your family, and that of your late wife.<br/>Band together with your neighbors, pooling some of your resources as a kind of insurance.<br/>Give up on the farm, pull up stakes, and try rebuilding your life yet again in a different milieu.<br/><br/><b><i>28 Days Later</i></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206515/#Comment_206515" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T21:36:25+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  9:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the dilemma? <br/>An engineered virus is released the sends the infected into a permanent, murderous rage.
