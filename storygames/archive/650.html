                    Reference to the rules are here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=616&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">Burning Monsters Now with Stakes</a><br/><br/>Last night, Ilena and I played a game of BMNwS.  It totally ruled.  During the first game, I played the monster and Ilena played the townsfolk.  We decided that she would get four townsfolk for each turn.  I totally slaughtered her!  She didn't even get one hit scored against me.  Totally works as it should!!!<br/><br/>So, we decided to even up the odds a little.  Yuk! For the second game, she still wanted to play the townsfolk.  HaHaHaHaHa! For this game, we changed the starting dice for the townsfolk from d4, d6 to d6, d8.  She managed to score one hit on my monster, and I totally wiped out her town.  Making crazy building falling down sounds as I did so.<br/><br/>So, there is clearly some <i>balance</i> issues involved if the townsfolk are to stand a chance at winning, so here is a solution that we haven't tested yet, but should help.<br/><br/><b>The Building's Strength</b><br/><br/>10 of the playing cards are assigned a die, which can be used once by the player holding the card.  Split the following dice among the ten cards: d20, d12, d12, d8, d8, d8, d6, d6, d6, d6.<br/><br/>2 of the playing cards are assigned the role of enter and sticky.  On a sticky card, all damage that the Monster does doesn't work this turn.  And enter is used with the boardgame portion of the game (see below).<br/><br/>The game needs some tweaking, but each game takes about 30 minutes, and it will probably turn out to be a kind-of-fun if not fun board game.<br/><br/><b>Optional: Board Game Rules</b>
<ul>
<li>The cards become hex tiles that can be laid out however the townsfolk want.  Except each hex must be touched by another hex on two side minimum.</li>
<li>The monster enters on the Enter Tile.</li>
<li>Max of five townsfolk on the board.</li>
<li>Monster can only destroy tile that it is on.</li>
<li>If Monster loses combat, townsfolk can push it back onto a destoryed tile.</li>
<li>Monster can only move onto square that either: a)previously destoryed or b)where townsfolk was just killed.</li>
<li>Townsfolk can move one hex per turn and then attack. They start where ever the players want.</li>
<li>Only two fires can be on the board at a time.  If the Monster butts up against fire, that fire's score applies in all combat.</li>
<li>Monster can only move through fire if there is no other direction to move.  One die level damage and gain one Anger die per rules.</li>
</ul>
<b>If The Building's Strength Rule Don't Work To Almost Even Up the Game</b><br/>Fight, Step One: Roll d6 per rules.  Characters with 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 roll together.  Or characters roll odd or evens roll together.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>If anyone wants to give this a playtest, I have the character sheets, paper townsfolk cut-outs, and the hexes that I can wrap into a pdf and send you.  A monster miniature could be used for the monster.  Ilena's out of town until Tuesday, so I can't test it here.<br/><br/>Maybe, solo play rules?                </div>

<p>Thor, I sent via email the goods.</p>
<p>Larry, I actually can't believe that I played this. Thanks for the idea.</p>
<p>The game is still pretty rough and doesn't play fair as written in the rules. Ha!!!! The monster should win!! I've played five or six solo versions of the game and am getting closer to something that might be pretty fun  It's so hard to tell solo because there is a lot to keep track of.</p>
<p>These are the changes that are getting closer in the board game:</p>
<ol>
<li>Townsfolk dice = d6, d4. These increase in die size on a win and now do not add additional dice.</li>
<li>IKWeapon = As the IKW stat increases it stays with the character even if the character gets squashed.  It can be rolled once it is in box three on the character sheet.</li>
<li>NOT TESTED YET: Add d20 hex, remove blank sticky hex.</li>
<li>Hex damage only occurs on the 1st round it is occupied by the monster, but all attacks during this round can use the extra die.</li>
<li>When character squashed, monster player can push character back three hexes. But, if townsfolk are unable to attack during a round because no character is near the monster, one may be moved near the monster to attack.</li>
<li>NOT TESTED YET: After Monster is totally roped down, townsfolk can push the monster back into destroyed hex when they win, and that hex is undestroyed.</li>
<li>Now playing with three townsfolk max.  Four may work, though.</li>
<li>Monster can move: 1) Over any vacated spot that a character was squashed in. 2) Anywhere if no townsfolk around.</li>
<li>When monster moves from a hex it is destroyed.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll probably do a couple of solo games tonight if I don't do anything. I haven't played with the Fire Rules on the recent playtests, but I will tonight.  I expect with the rules above combined with those in the manual for the board game and the fire rules, this should balance out pretty nicely.  Here's the story arc that I'm shooting for with the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monster beats the hell out of the villagers.</li>
<li>Villagers get stronger with IKW.</li>
<li>Monster almost destroys whole town.</li>
<li>Villagers push monster back.</li>
<li>Monster gets stronger via Anger.</li>
<li>Monster and Villagers very close in strength.</li>
<li>Final battles could go either way.</li>
<li>A little luck could tilt the game either way early.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I get this thing close to balanced (with the fire rules, it may be there), I need to make some sort of incentive for the different players playing the townsfolk.  Not sure what yet.  Maybe it doesn't need it.</p>
