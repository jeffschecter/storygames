I got it to a point where I was quite happy with it but around about that time I sort of lost interest in developing RPGs. My gaming group didn't really like playing the more indie flavoured games I was designing and so I was unable to really polish the game off.<br/><br/>Anyway, I recently put <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116869448616240130572" rel="nofollow">The Giant Brain</a> onto Google+ and Joe Prince asked me about Stitch's progress. I've tidied it up a bit and you can find the rules and required sheets over on my <a href="http://www.giantbrain.co.uk/downloads/" rel="nofollow">site</a>.<br/><br/>So here is a quick overview:<br/><br/> The game is set after an apocalypse that has wiped out the majority of the human race. The Administration that runs the bunker that the remainder of the population lives in are experimenting with sending people back in time to discover what happened. Each of the characters has been chosen for this mission because for some reason they have been identified as having had something to do with the apocalypse, their Residual Time Signature puts them close to the Event. The characters can't remember what they did to contribute to the event, that is what the game will tell us.<br/><br/>Each player takes it in turn to GM a single episode of the mission, called a Knot, which happens in real time for the players. Each Knot is 30 mins long that happens in real time for the players. During a Knot the objective of the GM is to shift blame for the Event away from his character and onto the others, whilst the other players are trying to do the exact opposite. Once each player has GMed a single Knot the game ends and their is a fallout based on how much blame has been placed on them over the course of the game. <br/><br/>The game is reasonably complete at this stage but needs a bunch more playtesting and a bunch more examples. I'm hoping the folks here who are so inclined can help me out with that. <br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX" title="RaconteurX"><img alt="RaconteurX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX">RaconteurX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413543/#Comment_413543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T08:15:33+00:00" title="May  5, 2013  8:15AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conceptually this sounds like it would make a good <i>Fiasco</i> playset... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
