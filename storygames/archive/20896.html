I recently signed up to run a few games at Dreamation in 2017. While I'm a pretty experienced GM and I've done a lot of online roleplaying with random players via roll20, I've never actually ran a game at a con. What should I be on the look-out for? Are there any tips or tricks you fine folk have that will make this a smoother process? I'm open to any and all suggestions.<br/><br/>As a side-note, I'm signed up to run a game specifically for kids (ages 6 to 12). Any pitfalls there? Any tips on how to handle that in particular? Thanks in advance!<br/><br/>p.s. I'm opting to make pregens for all of the games (except the Kids one) so we can jump right into the action. Good, Bad? Setting myself up for some kind of conflict I can't forsee?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458653/#Comment_458653" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-09T21:51:09+00:00" title="December  9, 2016  9:51PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always, always, always bring pre-gens (unless it's a game where character generation itself is something you think integral to the play experience, of course). Always assume that someone will show up with nothing: no dice, no pencil, no sheets, no character, no knowledge of the rules. If you can whip up convenient little hand-outs that summarize major points of the game for people with no or little or bad knowledge, all the better.<br/><br/>Really seriously think about your time constraints. 4-hour slots are usually pretty standard, and once you factor in players showing up late, having to introduce and explain everything, bathroom breaks, and giving people time to get their things together and make it to their next scheduled event on time, that's practically 3 hours you have left to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458654/#Comment_458654" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-09T22:06:22+00:00" title="December  9, 2016 10:06PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what games you plan to run, but if they require prepared scenarios, locations, or events, please bring a lot of stuff, but only expect to use material for half you allotted time. If it's a four-hour session, expect to use two-hours worth of material, instead of rushing the group through stuff. If you prepare a Dogs in the Vineyard town or an OSR dungeon, make them small. It always easy to introduce more wrinkles and more stuff than it is if you realize that you've only done the setup of the problems in the Dogs town and then time is up.<br/><br/>Decide if it's important to you to present the games exactly as written or if you're prepared to fudge if needed to keep everyone happy. If a roll kills a PC after half the session, decide if you want to fudge to keep the player in the game or bring more pregens to introduce, or how to handle this.<br/><br/>I supervised a My Life with Master convention game with multiple GMs that I didn't know many years ago. One GM came back after the session and was exhilarated and said "The group loved it, and we didn't use the rules at all!" like it was a good thing! It turned out they hadn't tracked changing attributes and had just decided when to start the endgame, but the group thought it was great. Not so great if they wanted to learn the actual game, but as long as you're open with the group I think it's fine to skip parts of the game that will take too long ("Normally, this would require a laboratory roll, modified by blah-blah-blah, but since it's cool if you get the potion you can create it overnight in camp!"). Be prepared to be ruthless to your prepared stuff and to the rules to ensure that the group has fun then and there, it's all that matters at a con.<br/><br/>In both Dogs in the Vineyard and InSpectres, I've created characters as part of the four-hour session, because I thought it was an integral part of the game and that it gives the group a shared understanding of the characters. But in a Whitehack game I brought pregenerated characters (lots of them) because the focus was on the dungeon, and I wanted to explain the rules as they came up in the game.<br/><br/>Also, be respectful of different players. At a convention, sometimes the group has played together before, but not at all in the way you usually do, sometimes some of them know each other, and sometimes no one knows anyone before the game. This all gives a different group dynamic, so try to pick up on who talks most and who's silent and include ideas from everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458655/#Comment_458655" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-09T22:20:52+00:00" title="December  9, 2016 10:20PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Treat kids like little adults. They know when you're talking down to them. Especially the smart, gaming kids.<br/><br/>If parents are there, sometimes they'll answer for their kids. I've found that children can handle themselves just fine if you can break them free of their parental yokes. I generally wait for the parent to jump in and answer, then get quiet and look at the child and ask them, "What do you think? What do you want to do?"<br/><br/>Sometimes kids (adults, too) get stage fright though. If they totally seize up and can't continue, offer them A, B, C-style choices, or even either-or choices. And maybe add, "Or do you just want a little more time to think about it?" and make it clear that it's okay to take a bit of time. Pausing puts a lot of pressure on people, though, so if they want more time, change gears or go to another player, then come right back.<br/><br/>In general, set table expectations around breaks and stuff. I tell my players, "You're grown-ups. If you need to take a break, just go." Otherwise, people will literally wait for you to schedule a break.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458656/#Comment_458656" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-09T22:24:54+00:00" title="December  9, 2016 10:24PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally, if you have played games with strangers on Roll20, you can handle a convention game. <br/><br/>The main difference is venue. Expect to be stuck in a loud room full of other gamers. Be prepared to speak loudly and clearly. Bring a bottle of water to stay hydrated, or you'll lose your voice. (Sometimes you luck out and get a private room at Dreamation, though.)<br/><br/>I plan to be there, too.

As for games: I'll be running two sessions of Blades in the Dark (the scenario is basically a Heat-style bank robbery), one session of a Supers game I've been working on, tenuously titled Relentless, and the kids game will be a game of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3TMkYb-oWtcmx5aFJnZzF0RGM/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Warrior Princess</a> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3TMkYb-oWtVGxmb3BrTW9hcGc/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">GM Reference</a>), also made by me. So that's four sessions in all. All of them have the traditional one GM, everyone else players structure. Strange side-note: I made specific mention that for the kids game, Parents may only play as retainers or Pets, not main characters. You think that will weird some people out? My intention was to let a parent "help" their kid, but only as these relatively mute creatures that can offer symbolic guidance.<br/><br/>Now, for the X-Card. I'd heard about it, but never read about it until you put down the link. I'm willing to give it a go, hopefully it will work as well as other people have related it does. Oddly a little nervous about implementing it. But, that's cause my usual spiel before games ends up being, "Hey, I don't take much anything seriously, so if you hear me or anyone else go off on a subject that bothers you let me know somehow. Speak up, raise your hand, throw paper at me, something." Buuuut, I can see how this is a more refined and civilized tool to accomplish the same effect. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> good lookin' out!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs">@Caroline_Hobbs</a> I like the idea with the name cards.

It also makes your life easier as a host.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458670/#Comment_458670" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-11T23:56:33+00:00" title="December 11, 2016 11:56PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a really bad experience with Blades in the Dark at the last Double Exposure con I attended, due to some of the exact issues brought up in this thread: chargen took forever, and even when that was done there was a ton of planning and hemming and hawing, despite the fact that avoiding all that is pretty much the entire point of the design. <br/><br/>It's a moderately crunchy design, so I'd definitely go with pregens there, and starting the first scene in media res.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458671/#Comment_458671" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T00:16:02+00:00" title="December 12, 2016 12:16AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Real name cards are redundant at Dreamation, since everyone should be wearing badges with real names on them, but just ask people to wear them some place easily visible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458672/#Comment_458672" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T00:48:44+00:00" title="December 12, 2016 12:48AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Caroline said.

Say hey if you see me. <br/><br/>Take care of yourself - stay hydrated, take breaks, check in with your table and generally look out for your own fun. Resist the temptation to not sleep the night before. If your games end up in the open room they will be very loud so plan on that in both physical demands (throat lozenges) and content (nothing too subtle). <br/><br/>For some reason that utterly baffles me, people show up completely unprepared to play. So bring pencils and extra dice or whatever you need to play, just in case. <br/><br/>It's easy, out of sheer excitement, to jump right into the game - resist this urge. Like Ben says introduce yourself, make sure everyone introduces themselves to one another, have a brief safety talk (I use the X-card when playing with strangers, so I explain that) and setting of expectations. I like to tell people where the nearest bathrooms are. This is five minutes very well spent, because it sets the tone for the session. <br/><br/>Respect everyone's time, including your own. Start on time, end on time. If you aren't used to working in a 2/4 hour framework, practice.<br/><br/>If you are likely to get caught up in things like I am, delegate. I usually ask a player to remind me when we are two hours in so we can take a break, for example. <br/><br/>You can absolutely rely on Dreamation staff to help out if you have a problem, do not hesitate. You probably won't! But if you do they have your back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458680/#Comment_458680" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T12:36:10+00:00" title="December 12, 2016 12:36PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey, you mention your own mild hearing impairment, it is also SUPER SMART in that opening welcome to ask if anyone has any needs to accommodate.

I would advise running anything you plan to run before you run them at the con, as others have said; making sure you have enough material, and that you have a sense of what the shape of the session should be given the time constraints, will spare you a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>I'm running at Dreamation for the first time myself this year (I ran some Trail of Cthulhu and a couple of sessions of Night Witches at Dexcon) so I will just reinforce one thing: the rooms are freaking <i>cold</i>, especially in the winter, and especially if you're not used to the weather in the Northeastern US. (I vividly remember nearly freezing to death one time when I wore a dress without tights.) I always bring a long scarf and a sweater with me. Be prepared <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>You may well get a small conference room all to yourself. Basically, there are three types of rooms: single party conference rooms, slightly larger conference rooms with two tables set up in them, and a large ballroom with several tables in it. Most of my experience has been in the single use conference rooms; I suspect the indie games tend to get that treatment. But do be prepared to need to shout if you get a ballroom table <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(The single use conference rooms are also the coldest; most don't have a window, so you get the full effects of the AC.)<br/><br/>Dreamation is a ton of fun; I'm going to be facilitating Fall of Magic and Nemesis 382, and running a purist (not a usual mode for me!) Trail of Cthulhu adventure. One of the best parts of Dreamation is a chance to meet folks from here, and designers you respect. Why, you may even get to play the Shield Maiden daughter of a disgruntled Gothi who is played by Jason Morningstar <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (And I did the best rp'ing of my life that Dreamation in a game of Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne.) Look me up if you want (ask for Cat, not Kat Miller) or sign up for one of my games. And most of all enjoy! You get to share something you love with people who want to love it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458691/#Comment_458691" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T21:55:35+00:00" title="December 12, 2016  9:55PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Great advice, everyone!

If what excites you is completely compatible with general convention best practices, then great, but if not, I don't think there's a clear correct path, just safer and riskier options.  <br/><br/>Personally, I've tended to go risky, cooking up brand new scenarios and being eager to see what players do with them.  I've had two spectacular successes, one serious failure which seems obvious in hindsight (amnesia &amp; hidden information? with strangers? some of whom may have had shitty GMs? BAD IDEA), and a bunch of okay to very good sessions with that approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458711/#Comment_458711" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-14T16:43:05+00:00" title="December 14, 2016  4:43PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As well as the X card, make sure you're familiar with the con's conduct policy so you know what to do and who to call on in the very very very rare case of something going askew.<br/><br/>Also, as you're running a kids game, double check the rules on that. I'd expect their parents to be present or - at the least - on hand. But there still seem to be the odd parents around happy to leave their kids with a stranger for four hours.<br/><br/>On timings, I do set my mobile to go off after 2hrs 3hrs and 3.5hrs. It's not for everyone but I find it helps me. If you aren't at the climax by 3.5 hours you need to hit it immediately.<br/><br/>IMHO if you finish 15mins early that's fine.

Two tricks here. Firstly, just put the data on the sheet and leave off name, gender etc. Allow players to choose these. Alternatively, produce two copies of each sheet, one for each gender.
