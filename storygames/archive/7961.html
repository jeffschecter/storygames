Jeepform games as a sort of \u201cliving room LARP\u201d are particular interesting as they seem a step close to tabletop games.  Anyway\u2026all of this got me thinking about an experience my group had in the late 90s when we were fully enmeshed in playing the Amber Diceless RPG.  Now Amber is a tabletop game with character sheets and a rulebook and lots of traditional stuff like that, but it also does away with so many of the mechanics of most rpgs that the game could easily slide into something else. . .<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we started playing in my friend\u2019s living room\u2014which was a large space with a couch, lots of chairs, and still enough room to have a sizeable open area.  And not by any articulated design we spontaneously started to stand up and move around the room, and I\u2019m fairly certain that if we\u2019d been playing something that was more about rolling dice and looking at combat tables this would never have happened.  Pretty soon this became our standard method of play.  We\u2019d sometimes incorporate props and generally do a lot of the things you might find in a LARP.  Now,  I\u2019m not saying what we were doing was LARPing, but we\u2019d really stepped away from the table and that was part of what made that game so memorable.  It became much more theatrical than what we\u2019d been doing previously.  So, I\u2019m wondering if anybody here has had similar experiences with Amber or any other tabletop games\u2014a situation where the table stopped maybe being so important and you took a step close to something like jeepform.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176083/#Comment_176083" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T12:51:23+00:00" title="October 24, 2008 12:51PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friends always joke "if you're standing at the table you're LARPing".  It sounds like you guys were LARPing to me, and looks like you had a lot of fun, so more power to ya!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
