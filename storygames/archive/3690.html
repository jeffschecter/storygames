Some day I will endeavour to be as polite ... but not today.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim:  You are demonstrably wrong on at least two counts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>One</i></b>:  People are not numbers, and their behaviors do not "average" in total to a composite personality.  It's like trying to find the square root of a poem or the second integral of family.  The idea isn't even untested or controversial, it's just WRONG by the very definition of the terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you pick out individual, linear measures that you can apply to people (often by polling) then you can create an average.  If you could create a measure of "myopia" or "passivity" then you could at least <i>conceive</i> of finding the "average" of that value across the population of gamers.  Even that, however, would not be any guarantee that there was even ONE gamer who was anywhere close to having the "average" values of myopia and passivity in combination ... much less the "average" personality that you posit on oh-so-many qualities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>Two</i></b>:  I'm sorry that you have such a low opinion of gamers, but I've just spent my weekend at DEXCON with <i>hundreds</i> of people who wanted exactly the stuff that you're saying gamers avoid like the plague.  Your theory is in direct opposition to all my practical tests.  You either need to get away from the twits who are giving you this low opinion of gamers, or else you need to get over whatever perceptual bias has you projecting this twittish image onto cool people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82731/#Comment_82731" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T13:32:29+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  1:32PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2007 1:41PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jim,<br><br>I'll let you and Mike go at it any way you guys choose to.<br><br>I'll just say, you started talking about "people."

Why are you posting this?  Is it about games to bring to cons?  About not disappointing people you people you drag into games while waiting at the bus stop?  About not publishing some games?  A frustration you're having with your gaming group?<br/><br/>What, exactly, is the point of your post. Because you seem to be going after something.  Your descriptions of "people" and "average gamers" bears little resemblance to the people I know or have gamed with.... And yet you also seem prepared for some sort of smack down after you've revealed a truth to us we don't want to hear.  Or something.<br/><br/>So, my question is, "Given the fact that you see gamers this way, and given the Sermon-on-the-Mount" tone of it (coming to a site which is explicitly not about the games you say the average gamer wants), what's you're point?<br/><br/>CK<br/><br/>* No, really, I will. Ask Josh and Jesse and people who know me. The probably never thought about it before, but if asked, they'll probably say, "Yeah, he would."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82732/#Comment_82732" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T13:36:14+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  1:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, you seem to really have this distaste for the "average gamer."

It's just a theory. Based on a short conversation about TRENDS we see at the local con. Combined with TRENDS I see at GENCON and combined with TRENDS I witnessed SELLING GAMES for 10 years.<br/><br/>Two. It's OBVIOUSLY not about people who feel so enlightened as to play INDIE or STORY related games. Rather, it's the AVERAGE GAMER who purchases an average of $2,000 worth of product a year (a real number) from such companies as WW, WOTC, PALLADIUM, and so on.<br/><br/>Three. I live in Southern California, a veritable dustbowl of good gaming. There is SOME here. But it's not like apples on a tree. My THEORY is based solely on what's around me. If I were given a government grant to study this theory further, I might be inclined to study gaming in all its forms across the US and CANADA.<br/><br/>Perhaps drawing a different conclusion.<br/><br/>But, again. Just an observation about what I see around me combined with YEARS of experience with every level of gamer.<br/><br/>FOUR. Who said I had a low opinion of anyone? Why are you assessing a value judgment to my observation? I didn't point fingers and laugh at someone for liking Buffy. I think it's INANE. But I don't care if you watch it. I find it suspect that an open-minded group of people (whatever the label) would be inclined to take on a persona and pretend to kill dragons by rolling dice. But as soon as that imaginary world is filled with uncomfortable things, comfort zones are shattered (I'll post on this in just a second).<br/><br/>FIVE.

A statement of taste.<br/><br/>Eric does NOT run games for everyone. People leave his games regularly at cons because they aren't WHAT THEY THOUGHT.<br/><br/>Eric accepts this about his hobby. He works in video games now and just makes games for fun in this hobby.<br/><br/>Good for him. That was not snarky.<br/><br/>Josh BishopRoby designs a game for himself and smiles confidently when he breaks the 200 copy barrier of self-published games.<br/><br/>This is an observation. I don't know how many copies Josh has actually sold.<br/><br/>Josh's game, to me, is weird. This is an opinion. I love some of the mechanics, but not all of them. This too is an opinion. But if he ran it at a con, I might play it, even though it's outside of my comfort zone. But I might not. Depends on the plot, I guess. <br/><br/>I have written dozens, if not hundreds of adventures for friends, for publication, and for conventions. I have had varying degrees of success. I think I was nominated for an Origins award on one. Others have been run once and thrown away.<br/><br/>In this example, I will use a 14-hour adventure that I've written for the local con. I have run it once for four people and one time no one showed.<br/><br/>Which brings me comfort zone and MY OPINION/OBSERVATION.<br/><br/>Average gamers don't want 14-hour games with morally ambiguous endings, or complex plot lines. Average gamers don't want to risk their fun-time on anything that doesn't guarantee at least mediocre results. Playing DOGS at a convention is safe, IF and ONLY IF, I'm fighting zombies in it?!? Or only if I'm guaranteed to win?? Or if the plot can be solved using 1% of my brain?!?!<br/><br/>This is an obervation/question. I don't have the answer. But I've drawn my own personal conclusion to help me write adventures that people WILL show up for.<br/><br/>Just because you don't game with people who like GUNDAM, doesn't mean that GUNDAM isn't repetitive.<br/><br/>This does not mean people that like GUNDAM are stupid. It means that GUNDAM is boring to me. This is an opinion.<br/><br/>Now. If someone takes the time to make a 14-hour game with complex characters, requiring 4 pages of background information (each written to individually match their POV in the story), what conclusion could one draw about gamer taste?<br/><br/>This is a question.<br/><br/>If a game about killing hamsters filled up in 10 minutes, and one person signed up for the Epic, never before done at this convention event, what conclusion could I draw?<br/><br/>This is a question.<br/><br/>I will admit that my original post was long and at times it meandered... I speak in analogies usually. Its my style. This is a forum for discussion, not a Ph.d dissertation. I wrote during my lunch break and now I'm racing back to finish the graphic design on one of those books I just mocked above.<br/><br/>I like coming to this site because you get a different grade of post then you would from say... ENWorld.<br/><br/>This is an opinion.<br/><br/>But, this post was merely a THEORY. A simple THEORY based on a short online conversation with PAUL about how to get people at our local con to try new things.<br/><br/>I thought, perhaps, it would spark a conversation rather than telling me I need to stop gaming with "those people."<br/><br/>A value judgment someone else made.

Ask a question or two.  Ask people what they think about some part of your theory.  After reading your initial post, I have no idea where you want the discussion to GO, or what kind of goal you have in mind in posting your thoughts.  There's nowhere to grab hold to, and push a discussion along.  Mostly I feel insulted by some sweeping generalizations, like this one:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite><br/>The average gamer is fairly myopic.</blockquote>\nAnd you expected those reading to be insulted, from the "knee jerk" comment.  Was it an attempt to grab attention?  I think you can consider the attempt successful, but the attention you have is wary and hostile.  Not a great starting point for discussion.

I believe I have the right to not like XYZ and then use as a point to establish that when XX% of people like XYZ that I'm missing the point of something... and that I won't ever be able to game with those people. If I'm trying to establish (for instance) what sorts of games people at the local con might play, I might want to analyze that. Right?<br/><br/>I am NOT you, Josh. I don't "know-it-all" and immediately say "screw it" to people who would never be my "customers." Believe it or not, despite the tone of this post, I try to be as INCLUSIVE as I can be.

Based on prior experience, both my own and from others in the west-coast version of Indie Games Explosion, I do not expect to have any empty slots.<br/><br/>At Gamex, I ran <em>Dogs</em>, <em>FLFS</em>, and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>.  I had no empty slots, although the <em>TMNT</em> game was fillled only at the last minute by a group of players who wanted to play something together.  Otherwise, this game which was as mainstream and UBER-THEMED as possible, would have had one player.  I added a last-minute game of <em>FLFS</em> and had no empty slots.<br/><br/>At OrcCon, I ran <em>FLFS</em> and <em>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</em>.  Again, no empty slots.<br/><br/>At (the late) GenCon SoCal, I ran four games of <em>FLFS</em>.  Each game had six slots.  Every slot was filled.<br/><br/>The thing of it is, Jim, my strategy for filling my games is to make the game look as little like "an RPGA xerox event" as possible.

I think I can agree with your first two points with a little modification. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I'd say that a majority of gamers enjoy a fortune-based resolution mechanic.  I'm not sure why that is, but I suspect there are many reasons.  I, for one, like collecting strangely-shaped, colorful shapes that are slightly mysterious (music of the spheres, anyone?) and I also enjoy the slight bit of suspense they provide when I physically roll them.  I could provide similar reasons for enjoying cards, especially if they help provide color to my game.  I'm not sure my this is a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I'd say that risk-aversion extends to the majority of all people.  They inherently fear the unknown and when someone comes along and attempts to turn their established construct on it's head, they react with fear and loathing.  Recently I attempted to explain Conflict Resolution to a very intelligent and entertaining friend who GMs for me.   His reaction was very negative.  He argued that it would result in a single dice roll determining the outcome of the game.  Even after I clarified that he was conflating scale with resolution, he attempted to argue that using Conflict Resolution would be a threat to the fun of roleplaying.  Ironically, he doesn't realize is that I've been using Conflict Resolution for some time now in my game and he's enjoying it immensely.  He's simply reacting to a perceived threat.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking this point of view, I come to a different conclusion.  Most people are myopic, including the fairly intelligent ones.  I would go so far as to suggest that most of us here have been myopic at some point or another.   It's usually induced by a lack of information and a lack of understanding that we lack that information.  The "average gamer" simply lacks some information.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wouldn't say that most people lack the skills necessary to evaluate and build criticisms of what they don't like,  they lack the courage, or even the will, to try new things.  Rather than appear afraid or unwilling to try a new experience, they revert to the "that's stupid" defense, which, of course, has little to back it.   The "average gamer" lacks the will to try new games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, if you stereotype "most people," you can generalize that the majority do form opinions quickly.  And they do it with whatever information they have at hand, which is usually personal experience or popular hearsay.  THEREFORE, if you want them to change their minds, you MUST provide them with new information that is comprehensible, personal, and unpretentious.  Part of the problem I had with my friend is that I presented Conflict Resolution as better than Task Resolution.  That was an error both in theory and in presentation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is our challenge to explain our new knowledge and information to the "average gamer" the best we can without making them feel threatened, stupid or unfashionable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Geez, you guys post quickly...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82767/#Comment_82767" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T14:37:57+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  2:37PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scary.

I can't keep up with the thread! <br/><br/>Here's my take: My experience, first-hand, with the sub-culture of gamers in general and at cons in particular, hasn't been great. So, in that, I'm not all the far from your opinions here, Jim. <br/><br/>But, my experience with people interested in playing games I've published has been fantastic overall. Not universally, not 100%. But, exceptionally rewarding. I created games that have been very bluntly dismissed by people whom I think it's reasonable to describe as "gamers." Or "traditional gamers." Which, sometimes sucks, because I like selling my books and I like people playing my games even more than the selling part. <br/><br/>But, while that has occasionally sucked, it is NOT something I lose sleep over or get frustrated by. I designed games that were, deliberately, going against the tradition among the hobby. I purposefully set out, and succeeded, to create games that the people Jim's describing would find very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I love this. This was the point. I set out, knowing that it would be un-fun at times, to challenge the status quo and in my small way expand the definition and experience of role-playing games. The aggregate effect of me and MANY OTHER DESIGNERS having changed that definition and experience over the last five years have blown away my expectations. I literally can't explain how much I consider it to have been a huge, revolutionary success. <br/><br/>The beat goes on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82778/#Comment_82778" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T14:48:45+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  2:48PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>People will only try what they are comfortable trying.</blockquote>\nIf that's what you want to take away from this thread, Jim, nobody can stop you.

I wrote this LARP 10 years before the movie Identity came out. But the PCs all play parts of a dying man's unconscious mind. But they don't know it.<br/><br/>Mystery LARP. No rules. Just roleplaying.

All story.</blockquote>\nOkay, so here's my response to reading this (and the longer version at NerdSoCal):<br/><br/>I get to play a loser?  Oh, and a loser who doesn't know when to quit.  In what looks like a totally generic fantasy setting.  And the guy who wrote this likes lots of metaphors, which usually signifies poor writing.  Oh but look, one clue remains, and if the guy who likes metaphors likes me enough, he'll let my loser-who-doesn't-know-when-to-quit to finally redeem himself.<br/><br/>Except it's going to take me FOURTEEN HOURS TO DO IT.<br/><br/>Mind: this is my reaction to the ad copy; I've not seen the game to actually comment on that.<br/><br/>Now, I know from prior conversation that the 'unconventional' thing about this game is that it's "The Fellowship of the Ring fallen apart and bitter."  I don't see in this ad copy any of the energy and interest that <em>you yourself</em> have shown about this concept.  Me personally, the thing that would attract me to this would be the opportunity to play a bitter old guy with a long history of misadventures with a group of people that he counts as brothers and hates at the same time.  I see none of that in the ad copy.  In fact, I see this dangling "one final clue" thing that implies to me that the game is going to be all about ignoring and overcoming our shared past history and finally doing what we set out to do -- so basically, anything that I might have liked about this set-up looks like it's going to be cut out at the knees to begin with.  Especially given the time slot, this looks like it's a big epic quest, railroad and all.<br/><br/>And before you say that the game isn't going to railroad the players -- that's great.  <em>That should be in the ad copy</em>.  It should go:<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Lost has been questing for 26 years to kill their nemesis, the evil wizard Whoodenany.  It has been 26 years of disappointment.  Now, as they ponder their last opportunity for success, they ask themselves if it's worth it, if they can bring themselves to try one more time, and how much Whoodenany would pay them to betray the others.<br/><br/><em>THAT</em> is a game I would play.  If it didn't take up one fifth of my con time.<br/><br/>But otherwise, Jim, I really don't see much that's startlingly different here.  It's a fantasy game where you're in a group fulfilling a quest.  If anything, I'd turn away from this because it's <em>too</em> mainstream, and I've played the fantasy quest RPG too many times already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82795/#Comment_82795" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T15:16:31+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  3:16PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2007 3:19PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [cross-posted with Joshau]<br/><br/>Jim,<br/><br/>From what you wrote, I'm seeing, "I have this really cool movie.

You'll see it's about how you've been promoting your work so far: holding back the trailer, holding back a clear poster, and simply saying, "It's good!

This is how you go to a movie:<br/><br/>Without having seen any trailers or flipped through a paper to look at ads, you get in your car.<br/><br/>You drive to the mall, fighting through traffic and driving around to finally end up in a parking space.<br/><br/>You get out of the car, walk up to the teen-age ticket-seller behind the glass and say, "Give me a ticket for whatever's playing next. I don't care what it is. That's how much I'm against risk-aversion. That's how much I don't stay in my comfort zone. That's how much nobody ever'll be able to call me myopic."<br/><br/>Because unless that <i>is</i> how you see movies, get over it.  <br/><br/>Assume it's your job to let potential players know what they're going to get in exchange for giving away 14 hours of their day.  You better offer up enough to make the trade worth it.  You don't have to give away the whole game. You have to give up enough details so I can make an informed decision -- if only based on the weightless compass of taste -- if I'm going to play your game.<br/><br/>That's not a problem with the average gamer. You want people to show up, that's what you do.  You don't get snooty about it. You don't blame people for being risk averse. (Unless, of course, the above description is how you go to movies. Because if that's how you do it, everything you've written at the start of this thread snaps into a whole new light. But other than that -- get over it.)<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82810/#Comment_82810" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T15:50:55+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  3:50PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim:  You have a datum:  Your games started off with some interest from gamers at conventions you go to.  That interest was never what you hoped it would be, and it has declined over time.  This is a problem for you, because you want to get excited groups of gamers at your table, playing the innovative games you want to be a part of.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have concluded from that datum that the problem must be in the gamers, and therefore there is <b><i>absolutely no point</i></b> to trying to fix the problem anywhere else ... like, oh say, by making better scenarios and marketing them in a catchier manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I get it now.  Your first post was, in effect, your letter of surrender to the inevitable ... yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you're on a site where common wisdom is basically that gamers absolutely <i>rock out</i>, and that they love new things, and so we're likely to have a different viewpoint on how "inevitable" your problem is.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow people have been giving you ideas for how you can fix this on <i>your end</i>.  Odds are, they're going to keep doing that.  We're helping folks.  But how are you going to read those?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you going to read these suggestions as attacks?  Are you going to sit tight on your assumption that you've already done everything that can be done, and the task is just <i>impossible</i>?  Are you going to feel that we're all blaming the victim (i.e. you) for problems that are completely beyond your control, that by suggesting that you can fix this we're trying to shift some sort of blame from the true villains, the "average gamers," onto your long-suffering shoulders?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr are you going to read the suggestions as they're intended:  As advice?  Are you going to get on board with the idea that you (yes, YOU!) can do awesome, exciting games that make you happy at the same time that they draw consistent capacity crowds?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause ... yeah ... it can totally be done.  It's been years since I had any spaces in one of my convention <i>Capes</i> games, and that's a game with NO GM, no narrative limits, rampant cut-throat competition, and maybe a half-dozen other heretical notions in it.  It's so far from the traditional comfort zone that the easy-chairs might as well be constructed from barbed wire.  I can't keep up with demand.  People want to try out the fit of those easy chairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, your choice.  Do you want to cling to your notion that you're already doing everything right, or do you want to learn how to do this?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour responses are getting very short and curt, and it tends to make me think you're going for the former.  It looks like you've concluded that we just don't understand the truth of your "average gamer" insight, and that we're foolishly and offensively trying to teach you ways to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.  If so, I hope you'll have the decency to tell us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82811/#Comment_82811" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T15:57:41+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  3:57PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well.

Other words for small picture/big picture are facts and theories.  Earlier you talked about how you had posted a theory and how can you criticize a theory.  The answer is: you criticize a theory by showing how it is not supported by facts.<br/><br/>Because at the end of the day, the theory doesn't matter.  Whether or not our description of the "average gamer" is accurate means piss-all.  What matters is the facts: what matters is whether or not real people had fun playing your game.<br/><br/>But that's all tangential.  Jim, you keep saying that you're seeing new things, but you're not sharing what those new things are.  What was wrong about your original conversation with Paul?  What's your "clearer vision" that you have now?

I should have posted with less snarkiness, but that's my bad habit that I need to break. If you read past the "anger," you'll see that I was really just looking for open dialog about this.<br/><br/>Maybe I got more than I wanted.<br/><br/>That THEORY has many layers. The smallest of which is getting people to game with me at the con. The biggest of which is writing what fans what to read.<br/><br/>Which may not be a popular question with people, but I'd like to know.<br/><br/>I will never produce a GUNDAM GAME. But knowing why someone likes GUNDAM COULD help me make something else good.<br/><br/>This too may not be a popular opinion here, but that's okay.<br/><br/>My original post is merely my opinion, albeit far too broad for any kind of discussion.<br/><br/>I should have ended with some sort of question to focus things in.<br/><br/>Again. My fault.<br/><br/>I don't think my opinion has changed much, but I've learned a couple of useful things.<br/><br/>One. Marketing anything is about the feel of it. No matter how much I hated writing the backs to those d20 books, it really was about evoking emotion... and I've somehow lost sight of that in recent years.<br/><br/>Two. My stories still probably won't ever win an oscar, but I shall endeavor for more creative ways to hook people with them. Regardless of conventions or novel proposals or whatever.<br/><br/>Three. Josh doesn't like metaphor.<br/><br/>Four. Forums and blogs are not the same thing. If I write something BIG on my blog, I take ownership of it. A screw anyone who doesn't like my blog. Haha. If I post in a Forum, it becomes part of a dynamic collective, if you will, and the ideas the germinate from that dialog are much different than comments at the bottom of some RSS Feed.<br/><br/>Five.
