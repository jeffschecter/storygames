So I kind of get worried if I am introducing too much complexity.<br/><br/>The cards would be used to introduce conflicts / complications / plot twists / bangs / etc into the game, and eventually work as a point system (when dealt with) for progress toward in-character goals.<br/><br/>I want to keep using dice -- 2d6 to 4d6 -- as the resolution mechanic WMHS.  But do you think it's too much for a simple game to have too many separate components like that?<br/><br/>Yeah, I know it's hard to answer without seeing what all I'm intending.  If the rules said:\n<blockquote>You need the following to play:<br/><br/>* At least 3 or 4 friends<br/>* At least eight six-sided dice<br/>* A standard deck of playing cards<br/>* A character sheet for each player (copy page XX or download it)</blockquote>\nDoes that seem like too much, or not too much?  Are there many games which use both dice and cards, for different purposes?<br/><br/>(PS:  What about <i>poker chips</i> too?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145731/#Comment_145731" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T13:07:06+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  1:07PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The original Deadlands used chips, dice, cards, paper clips, and basically anything you could find in your junk drawer.

Some players love complexity and some players hate it.</p>\n<p>The important question, in my opinion, isn't what other players may or may not like.  It's what you and your immediate circle of players like.  If you like it and have fun with it, then it's a good bet that there are others out there that will like it too.  And if you don't like it, then it doesn't matter what other folks like.  You won't be able to play the thing enough to make it into a really good game.</p>\n<p>And, if you enjoy both choices, then I say you pick the one you think feels best.  Whim.  Yup.  That's my suggestion.  The more you enjoy your game the more other folks will enjoy it.  That's been my experience anyway.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145821/#Comment_145821" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T21:48:37+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  9:48PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You can tell how good a game is by how heavy the box is." - far, far too many boardgamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145822/#Comment_145822" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T21:51:52+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  9:51PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd want to see each being put to use differently.
