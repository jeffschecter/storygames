Not just combatants, not just major actors, but authority figures, traders, passerby, victims... the works. I hadn't noticed this before, but it turns out its a pretty strong bias - if the "on screen" characters in a session are one-third female that's a very good session indeed. One-fifth is more usual.<br/><br/>To work on this, I'm developing tactics. Firstly, explicit goals that we can target and track:\n<ul>\n<li>\tI included good, strong female NPCs (i.e. there were some, without thinking about ratios. This is a kind of "starter target" that is easy and needs little book-keeping.)<br/></li><li>\tAt least as many female as male NPCs came \u201con screen\u201ds<br/></li><li>\tThe power balance of onscreen NPCs was roughly equal between the sexes<br/></li><li>\tThe diversity of NPCs by age, role etc was comparable between the sexes (this is a classic one to mess up - easy to make only (a) young, attractive women plus a few (b) wizened old crones hunched over cauldrons)<br/></li><li> The sexualisation/emphasis on the appearance of onscreen NPCs was roughly equal between the sexes<br/></li></ul>\nAnd some tactics I've tried or am about to try for achieving them:\n<ul>\n<li> Explict check in pre-session prep --- am I at, or above, gender parity in terms of prepared NPCs (including NPCs that predate this session - may need to compensate for past bias)<br/> </li><li> Have a "cull" of existing male NPCs - explicitly mark as "out of play for now", or even kill/incapacitate. Replace each with one or more women who fill a similar role.<br/> </li><li> Policy - all improvised-on-the-spot NPCs are women (to compensate for my tendency to conjure up men. This one is important for me as ~most of my NPCs start this way)<br/> </li><li> Be willing to consciously introduce e.g. five women in a row and make no comment on it (maybe no-one will notice... and if they do, would they have noticed five men in a row?)<br/> </li><li> Have a list of context-appropriate female name right there in front of you; leave the male names in the book or folder.<br/></li><li>Don't make gender an explicit issue in the setting - don't make characters or cultures that are noticeably gender-biased<br/></li></ul>\n<br/>Anyone else done something similar, or have any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439339/#Comment_439339" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-12T02:14:21+00:00" title="October 12, 2014  2:14AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2014 3:12AM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roll it.

So I made sure it was a 50-50 ratio. I didn't think that much about active and passive roles; just that I populated my worlds with women. Now I'm doing that automatically so I have taken a further step to check if any women are in more prominent positions. Honestly, I prioritize putting women in higher positions so I don't forget this.<br/><br/>I actually get annoyed when others don't have a 50-50 ratio. Even more when there is total lack of women in important positions. This goes with TV-series like True Detective and film as well (last movie that annoyed me: Riddick), as compared to Battlestar Galactica and The Walking Dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439343/#Comment_439343" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-12T05:08:07+00:00" title="October 12, 2014  5:08AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>10 or lower = attracted to same sex</blockquote>This is not part of "gender" and it's completely irrelevant to determine this for any character not featured in a romantic or sexual interaction.</blockquote>\nThis may be the case for your home culture, but it is not the case for every member of the species everywhere. Hey, let's discuss sex and politics <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Seriously, though. My own strategy in this regards is generally to question why each character is whoever they are: why are they young, old, male, female, and so on. I generally want to have things be whatever way they are for a reason, so e.g. the gender of a NPC is usually chosen deliberately based on factors such as their role in the narrative, thematic position, harmonizing or contrasting with the milieu, etc. As I don't assign gender arbitrarily and thoughtlessly, one might say that my strategy for combating gender bias is to think before I write <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Sometimes this leads to deliberately switching genders from what would be more instinctual for me, but as I often play games where various types of historical, sociological credibility have been important, I've never done radical gender-blind equality schemes. If I did, I'd love to roll randomly, like Tod suggests. Would be highly appropriate for e.g. WotC D&amp;D fantasy, Star Trek liberal utopism and similar genres that depict radically gender-blind societies.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439344/#Comment_439344" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-12T06:26:47+00:00" title="October 12, 2014  6:26AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2014 9:15PM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is not part of "gender"</blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> is correct, or course.

In fact in our old west game female npc's are generally wives, teachers, missionary/nuns, or whores in keeping with that particular bit of history.<br/><br/>Fact is, most societies are/have been patriarchal/male-dominated, so that leads to the most familiar realism element. In pure fantasy games (like our D&amp;D), I greatly enjoyed purposefully crafting matriarchal races and cultures to get away from this. However there's still plenty of gender oppression in most societies. <br/><br/>About the only games where it really doesn't figure in are superhero and sci-fi. Those games seem to be much better at creating gender neutral experiences.<br/><br/>Of course, there are other things at work as well. I would wager that males tend to be more comfortable creating/using males. I'm also certain that some are just put off by the potential trap: "I want to be sure to include more female NPCs, so I'll make a 'rescue the damsel' game." Or far worse, to me at least, is the artificial forced balance that makes no sense within the narrative.<br/><br/>So rather than worrying about it we do it like we try to do everything else in gaming - do whatever makes sense in the narrative and screw anyone that has a non-realism problem with it. 8-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439351/#Comment_439351" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-12T15:12:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2014  3:12PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I try to mix it up as much as possible, so that it's even when you include the player-characters.

Some games look for more idealized literary depictions of humans with roots in various historical narrative genres, while others are all about your internal expression, and yet another kind want you to depict realistic, relatable types. Any of those types might be pretty inappropriate for a game that focuses heavily on something else.<br/><br/>So yeah, my usual advice for anything at all: break it down analytically and act accordingly.<br/><br/>More concretely, I've found that a solid baseline for almost all games I've played women in is to play the character as a human first, and then add some gender-appropriate superficial detail. Sometimes, where appropriate, the "superficial" detail may flower into an interesting and true to life fracture in the otherwise relatively gender-neutral characterization, while most of the time you'll at least be guaranteed a mild and game-appropriate portrayal, even if it so happens that nothing more comes out of the womanity of the character. I'm admittedly not much of a risk-taker in this regard; I've no need to go all drag queen until a game explicitly calls for it, so a relatively low-emphasis technique like this suits me fine. I'm not even much of a believer in gender essentialism, anyway, so playing women as if they were human suits me fine.<br/><br/>For example, <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is a game where men end up playing female characters all the time, due to the requirements of the genre - it's a pretty drama-poor group (or perhaps one banking on a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" rel="nofollow">ho-yay</a> subtext) that voluntarily makes a zombie movie with <i>only</i> male characters. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if half my experience roleplaying woman characters were in that game. My general experience is that it's not difficult to do a satisfying job on the role, either, by the above technique: just determine social class, politics, values, relationships and such for the character, and let the <i>idea</i> that the character is a woman do all the gender-related work for you. You do this by reminding the other players regularly about her femininity: do the same things you'd always do, except slip in some little mention about discarding your high heels before sprinting out and away from the zombies.<br/><br/>This subtle, yet superficial, reinforcement of the mental imagery will then basically do all the interpretation work for you: you don't have to choose whether your character being female <i>matters</i>, and what it <i>means</i>, because you're merely representing her for the other players to react to. It's in fact the other players who decide whether they care, and what femininity will mean in this game; usually they do care, and often in Zombie Cinema we see machismo, feminism and romantic themes spark out as reaction to the relatively straightforward fact that there's a female protagonist in the story. Femininity here is something you impose upon the other players as something to react to, so it's not actually <i>too</i> important how you do the thespian side of it: as long as you express (my narrativism theory is all about expressing characters) the idea that the character is a woman strongly enough that the other players take note, they'll do the rest of the work. (Not that you can't do the expression ham-handedly, but that's why I suggest taking "she's just a human who happens to be a woman" as your baseline, and work from there - you'll avoid embarrassment and remain a salon-worthy contributor to the game.)<br/><br/>Of course that same technique can be used the other way around, it's just that most of the time most of the players do not see anything remarkable in somebody being male, so they do not feel much need to react to it. That's what male-normativity in society and arts means, I guess. Play <i>Maid</i>, though, and you're suddenly in a game where it does indeed matter if your character is male, and it is indeed a good idea to sprinkle your contributions with minor flavour that reminds everybody of the fact.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439362/#Comment_439362" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-12T17:08:47+00:00" title="October 12, 2014  5:08PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I tend to do male NPCs because I am awesome at doing male voices and terrible at doing female voices.</blockquote>\nOh, also: I guess my answer is easier to understand if I note that my roleplaying seems to involve extremely minimal amounts of thespian effort compared to what many seem to be doing. At most I'll vary the cadence of speech for NPCs, and even then it's mostly to distinguish between "Eero is talking to you the player" and "this NPC is talking to you the character". More of a storytelling technique than character acting, so that the opinions and choices of characters are emphasized over how they deliver their lines.

Let's roll to see if it's a he, a she, or something less clear-cut."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439381/#Comment_439381" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-13T13:04:20+00:00" title="October 13, 2014  1:04PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Name lists... yes, that's a good idea and something I've been under-using anyway.

So my gaming style clearly won't appeal to you because it's a board game. <br/><br/>But like I said,  if you're serious about it, look up trans resources,  and consider investing in sessions with a trans-specialized voice coach who can help you get it right. <br/><br/>And meanwhile, don't see women as something different,  as Rickard suggested.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439403/#Comment_439403" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T00:13:01+00:00" title="October 14, 2014 12:13AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's one:<br/><br/><a href="http://youtu.be/0IJSo_uApts" rel="nofollow">Transgender voice lesson 1</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439409/#Comment_439409" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T03:44:17+00:00" title="October 14, 2014  3:44AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2014 5:30AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caoimhe, I'll try to pretend your longer post above was general advice to the world, in which case I'd agree with all of it, instead of directed at me, which would just piss me off because I don't do any of that shit.  <br/><br/>I guess it was dumb on my part to lead off by saying "I'm terrible at doing female voices", but I think I've since clarified that that was in reference to my own standards of thespian skill, not basic standards of respect and good taste.

All kinds of voices.  I do them when I'm GMing and I do them when I'm reading to my kids.  And while I don't think my "female" voices literally sound like they came out of a female throat, they do have qualities I bring forward with female referents in mind.  They "come across" female.  (I also do Orcs, Trolls, Gollum, little mice, etc.)<br/><br/>But my father?  He read to me, but he didn't do voices.  Still, whenever a character "spoke" in my father's voice, it was "italicized" in a way; the lilt and tempo of his voice got slightly different.  He may have even cocked his head slightly.  I could easily tell it was a character speaking and not the narrator anymore, but I couldn't always tell <i>which</i> character was speaking.  Those moments were similar to reading dialogue where the author has left out all the "he saids" and "she saids".  We want to avoid that kind of character-confusion.<br/><br/>So, putting that together with my experiences of other people's literary readings (audiobooks, performance art, etc), it seems to me that the bare minimum you really need to shoot for (generic you) would be something like my father's level of "italicization" - i.e. just enough so that everyone knows it's not you speaking literally right now - plus a smattering of gender-based pronouns and descriptives which can be easily worked into your narration by adding just a little physical movement.  I.e....<br/><br/>"<i>I'd love to come along, but I have my responsibilities.</i>  She gestures at the entire castle with a mesmerizing wave of her long fingers and gracefully picks up a goblet from a nearby tray-table."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439413/#Comment_439413" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T05:18:31+00:00" title="October 14, 2014  5:18AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, this is clearly not on topic anymore, but now I've gotta know: is it really that rare for a GM to add a dialogue tag to indicate who's speaking, the way literature does it?

But if it wasn't about you...you know how that goes. <br/><br/>And. There are, as <a href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">@Caoimhe</a>, a lot of resources out there for transfeminine people to try and practice voice control. And it's an extremely touchy subject, with a lot of emotion bound up in it, because voice is a very difficult thing to master. But it has <i>so many</i> ramifications: economically (do you dislike phone interviews? Multiply by infinity.), emotionally (how would you like to reveal your intimate life history when you order a coffee), and hell, <i>actual life and death</i>. So. Like I said, touchy.<br/><br/>(Also, it's not like you didn't say your own controversial stuff: I know a lot of very good GMs who don't do voices at all. I use accents probably more than any GM I know. YMMV.)<br/><br/>Anyway, more on topic, because I've done this gig before--hell, I made a world with strenuous gender equality (I kept careful check of who I had in positions of authority to make sure it was evenly split) with the exception of the throne, where there was a cultural preference for a Queen. Of course, my players described the world as a matriarchy, which seems to be a Greek word meaning gender equality.<br/><br/>In the last year or so I've kit-bashed a couple of campaigns and in the process, expanded the roles of women. Slight spoilers for both below:<br/><br/>a) <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i>: There are actually a few women in this, but practically none are developed to any great degree; I went about fixing that. First, I gender-flipped an important (but in the original text, MacGuffiny) NPC, Jackson Elias; making her an intrepid female reporter gave me a lot of insight into the character. (I was always going to try to get the PCs to be emotionally invested in Elias, but the gender flip helped <i>me</i> emotionally invest in the character.)<br/><br/>Next was Hypatia Masters, who in the original text serves mostly as a literal vessel for body horror and is depicted for the most part as an airhead socialite. That wasn't going to stand, so instead I had her broker a deal with Nyarlathotep and become a powerful, near-immortal figure that could act as an ambiguous ally of the PCs.<br/><br/>Finally, I pulled M'Weru off her mountain in Africa and made her an undercover asset, working with the PCs to manipulate her co-conspirators, and gave her a forceful personality and a lot of earned achievements to match.<br/><br/>This in general can serve as an outline of how to included more female characters in a misogynist time period (such as the 1920s): make several memorable/important/powerful NPCs to serve as proxies. (I note in passing that I also included several interesting/powerful female NPCs not in the original text along the way.)<br/><br/>b) <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i>: Standard Operating Procedure for me when I run anything I didn't write is to break down the motivations of the NPCs, as they are often poorly developed. Or, in the case of <i>Keep</i>, non-existent. The first thing I did was assign broad characteristics to each of the tribes in the Caves of Chaos, and give them named leaders. Of these, three--the kobolds, the orcs of Cave B, and the gnolls--got female leaders. The most important of these was the leader of the orcs--she was a crafty and experienced centurion of an orc military unit organized along the lines of a Roman century, with high competence and unit pride. She quickly became a favorite of the PCs. <br/><br/>(The kobold queen got massacred early, and the gnolls didn't figure in too much, but when the barbarian PC killed the leader of the other orc tribe and became their chief, he discovered that the tribe was actually managed by the trio of wives who ceremonially married the current chieftain, whoever he was.)<br/><br/>I made a couple of the other NPCs female as well. The leader of the keep isn't highly detailed, so I made her female, the highly respected Lady Belladonna. There's a mad hermit in the woods, which was a boring idea to me, so I made her a druid, one of the last remnants of the original inhabitants of the region. Probably in the end I had more male NPCs than female NPCs, but the memorable named ones tended to be female.<br/><br/>This is more illustrative of what you can do in fantasy or scifi: just make a lot of NPCs female, and make sure to have them in places of importance.<br/><br/>A word about portrayal: as with any kind of quasi-narrative, what's going to matter most is <i>motivation</i>, not any particular tics of the character. Yes, tics/quirks are a powerful way to differentiate the characters, especially if you aren't good at voices or other acting techniques. Yes, it helps to draw clear, almost caricatured portraits of NPCs. But what will make them <i>work</i>, what will make them characters in a narrative, is their motivation. You don't need to have a female NPC kick off her high heels (NB: many women never wear heels) <i>unless</i> that says something about her character in some way. You don't need to worry so much about mannerisms or voice. You <i>do</i> need to wonder about why she's doing what she's doing, and <i>then</i> if being a woman is important or influences that motivation, look to ways to express that. It's often not...as crucial as it might seem. In my examples, M'Weru and Hypatia were both influenced by having been born women in a repressive time, but that only mildly shaped their real motivations (power/the destruction of colonialism for M'Weru, immortality/politics among the Outer Beings for Hypatia.) In <i>Keep</i>, Burgash the orc and Belladonna the commander came from cultures where being a woman in authority was absolutely unremarkable, and so I treated it that way.<br/><br/>So it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439418/#Comment_439418" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T08:41:38+00:00" title="October 14, 2014  8:41AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>If <i>you</i> don't do voices, cool, have fun, but I hope you let me know that at the con so I can skip your game.

I doubt any of your players are going to be sitting there counting NPCs and holding you to some kind of quotas, so probably a best effort process would be enough, right?<br/><br/>If we're talking about published games or adventures, that's a different thing where you actually do need to run the statistics.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439438/#Comment_439438" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T19:24:44+00:00" title="October 14, 2014  7:24PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2014 7:25PM by Rickard.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The main problem is improv - I don't pre-plan that much, so most NPCs (especially minor-to-middle-status) ones are improvised.

Like the player who finish first with character generation or something. Perhaps you could make it into a ritual that before you start playing, that everybody brainstorm names for you to use?<br/><br/>(It has a second effect too.

Sadly, the players always assume it's a guy.<br/><br/>(And I will never forget the time when I described the bad guy's hair as blond during towards the end of the session, and the players afterwards told me that they had all imagined the guy's hair as black.

If it is a society built around men as warriors and high members of political circles, then there will be more male interactions and same for the reverse. Personally, I would think an exact 50/50 blend of interactions would be unrealistic, if that can be said about fantasy gaming. Which brings attention to your final point: <blockquote>Don't make gender an explicit issue in the setting - don't make characters or cultures that are noticeably gender-biased</blockquote>\nWhile not an explicit issue, in my games, there is a spectrum that divides society. Some of the societies may be influenced by wealth, some by heredity, and others by gender. To make gender not an explicit issue, I think making the rule "don't make characters or cultures that are noticeably gender-biased," causes gender to be an explicit issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439451/#Comment_439451" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T08:02:20+00:00" title="October 15, 2014  8:02AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2014 12:38PM by Rickard.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Personally, I would think an exact 50/50 blend of interactions would be unrealistic, if that can be said about fantasy gaming.</blockquote>\nThis is a weird comment because we're talking about how to break free from the habit of having the male be the norm.

At various times, and in various cultures, women have enjoyed occasional prominence and influence.

It's inconceivable, I think, to say that in any situation 50% of the population did not matter, or did not have a significant impact on the events of history.<br/><br/>Even in those cultures and times when women may have been forcibly excluded from social discourse, politics, or what-have-you, there is no question in my mind that:<br/><br/>1. Women would have been present and relevant and influential in whatever was going on, even if their participation wasn't as visible or as direct. <br/><br/>It may be as simple as the famous cliche: "Behind every powerful man is a more powerful woman", or it may be more subtle (a famous Emperor deciding to engage in a war of conquest because his mother goaded him into it), but there is no question that even in the most repressive societies, there are lots of influential women behind any given moment in time.<br/><br/>2. Women would have been far more present than we might think now, looking at a history text. They were there - after all, they had to be. <br/><br/>We know very well that there were many famous artists, scientists, philosophers, and so on, who were actually women who wrote under a pseudonym, had their work stolen and claimed under a male name, or just weren't acknowledged by whichever historian was writing about that period. (In other words, their name may have been willfully omitted, effectively censored from a historical account.)<br/><br/>Just because a history text doesn't mention any women doesn't mean they weren't involved and heavily influential at that time and in that place.<br/><br/>I see no problem with a "realistic" depiction of any kind of human society in an RPG including all kinds of powerful, influential, brilliant, and important female characters.<br/><br/><br/>*: And it's worth noting that, throughout history, many (most?) armies traveled with a contingent of non-combatants, which would have included large numbers of women, as well. (They could have, under some circumstances, even outnumbered the male soldiers in a given army.) So even this may be misleading.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439468/#Comment_439468" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T16:46:14+00:00" title="October 15, 2014  4:46PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Actually, on Rickard's second point, there are issues here with social status - realistic for there to be many women, not so realistic for them to occupy positions of high status.

I feel this to be worthwhile because this objection is trotted out all the time, so apparently there are a huge number of people out there who genuinely don't understand why you might want to have dragons, yet not have utopian gender relations in the same work.<br/><br/>The reason why somebody might draw the line at gender roles, yet not at dragons and magic, is that they may be going for the literary genre of "historical romanticism", which continues to live as what is commonly called "vanilla fantasy". This genre of fantasy is often sort of misrepresented as being "about" elves and dwarves and dragons and magic, when it's actually more about something that I like to characterize as a romantic longing for a mythical past when men were heroes, swords were swords and horses were transportation.<br/><br/>This creative mission statement is behind a great amount of the canon of fantasy literature, and you can see the seamless transition from the genre of historical romance (Sir Walter Scott, Victor Hugo, etc.) to fantasy literature proper, with J.R.R. Tolkien at the height of the literary sensibility involved here. For literature (and gaming) in this mode, fantastic elements are there as poetic symbols that heighten appreciation of human qualities: the wizard is <i>so wise</i> that the wiseness seeps out as magic, and so on. Furthermore, the quasi-historical setting is there in an effort to strip down the human condition into something more basic and easier to perceive, for the purpose of transmitting various literary themes: if these people, living in this simple world, can make these kinds of choices, what does that tell about you, modern man?<br/><br/>For this genre of fantasy a fundamental matter of human nature like gender is not primarily a political issue, you can't just overwrite what you consider the historical norm, the "natural order of things", simply because you want to make it more comfortable for players to take on roles in the fantasy setting. By doing so you would no longer be commenting on the relevant human condition of our past, as your world would then be merely wishful thinking rather than being a condensed perspective on what the world has historically been like. Saying that you gotta have gender equality for comfort here would be like saying that you gotta let every player character get assault rifles for comfort - it goes directly against the aesthetic goals, so either you scuttle the Plan regarding romantic historical fantasy, or you accept that this setting is going to feature some historical types of gender stereotyping.<br/><br/>I should note that setting-fidelity to perceived historical human condition does not need to mean that player characters are particularly hassled about it; it's common to treat PCs equally regardless of gender or other human traits, even if they have to face a world that treats them whatever way. <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is an example of a game that is utterly reliant on historical themes of oppression for its content, for example, and it generally encourages you to play women or ethnic minorities who are often in subservient positions in the fictional societies depicted in the game; it's just that your character is fortunate enough to have the means to be a hero who overcomes the generally oppressed condition of their ordinary class. <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is another example of a game that is nigh pointless if you insist on not depicting historical social ills of the American society, which often causes tension between this creative drive for historical realism and the desire to acknowledge that women, ethnic and sexual minorities are welcome to play, even if within the game world these same minorities are often treated in rather inhuman ways.<br/><br/>Also, it should be obvious that if you're <i>not</i> doing something like this - if your D&amp;D setting is just an excuse to mix up some dragons and githyanki and beholders for a soap opera or slaughterfest or whatever - then there indeed is no good reason not to have a radically player-conforming setting, including idealistic notions about gender, ethnicity, religious freedom and other historical societal issues. My impression is that the reason why there is so much covert resistance to radical gender equality in fantasy gaming is that the historical romanticism is <i>really common</i> as a more or less well-understood theme, one that explains a lot about what people find appealing about fantasy in gaming and literature. I know that it's one of the central hooks for me, as regards being interested in fantasy gaming. I can remember how nigh-disgusted and disappointed I was with the magic torches that were introduced on the D&amp;D equipment list in 4th edition, exactly because of the way the concept went directly against the thematic ideas of historical romanticism: if your fantasy world doesn't even have fear of the dark in a pre-electric society, then why the heck keep up with this swords-and-horses rodeo instead of just going full <i>Star Trek</i> with it? Since then, looking at my own D&amp;D gaming, it's been very strongly oriented towards the ideals of historical fantasy, insofar as literary theming goes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439469/#Comment_439469" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T16:57:56+00:00" title="October 15, 2014  4:57PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2014 10:27PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent post, Eero.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I've had a few barely-related thoughts:<br/><br/>a) If you don't understand how you can have traditional gender roles and powerful, common, and significant female characters, go read some classic drama. Shakespeare might be your best bet. (But even Dumas will do.) And that's without getting into non-European mythology, which may give you much stronger examples. You'll find lots of examples which go against what your "gamer instincts" might tell you. (And, yeah, Lord of the Rings isn't particularly helpful - although even there we can find a few good examples through Eowyn and Galadriel. Figure out what makes them memorable and important characters, and do more of that.)<br/><br/>b) From the thespian side of things, my personal take is that a man attempting to do a "female voice" (completely with higher pitch, etc) tends to come off pretty badly. Laughable at best, and potentially offensive. So, assigning a character mannerisms, much as you would with any NPC, is usually plenty. There's no need to think of them as being gendered mannerisms. ("The Duchess speaks slowly, and likes to pause and smile before delivering bad news.")<br/><br/>However, another technique you can use is to draw on non-verbal cues. Adopt a certain posture or position when speaking as a particular character. Perhaps this character is always stroking her shawl when she is nervous. That one always holds her nose up and keeps adjusting her glasses when they slip. In an appropriately tongue-in-cheek game, maybe the bad guy always holds a cat in his or her lap and strokes it while talking. Perhaps when you are a certain character, you stand up from the table or rub your nose a lot.<br/><br/>You can use a prop (a mask, a hat, a shawl, a fan, a cigarillo, a portrait/headshot, etc.) to represent a character, as well. Pick it up (or even just touch it) when you're speaking as that character, and a fictional persona starts to be associated with that prop, each time the character is "on screen".<br/><br/>All of these are nice ways to get a distinct personality across without necessarily having to modulate your *voice* in an unnatural and unconvincing way. Let the players' imagination fill in the other aspects of the character, much as they do when you switch between roleplaying a wheezing goblin and a mighty ogre. After all, it works just fine when you read a book (or, as pointed out above, even when someone reads a book *to you*).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439470/#Comment_439470" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T17:43:33+00:00" title="October 15, 2014  5:43PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2014 12:26AM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great posts from Paul and Eero.  <br/>This is not the only area in which people consistently confuse diegetic and non-diegetic aspects of play.  But it's a common one.<br/><br/>When we separate these levels, we can see that it's possible to run a world of diegetic misogyny (or misanthropy, for that matter) with a group of players who practice total gender equality (even parity) at the table, and for some places/times that would be a more "historically accurate" way to do it - with or without gender-swapping.  (If historical recreation is your thing, of course).  As pointed out above, this does <i>not</i> mean that your female <i>players</i> are oppressed in any way, nor that you yourself <i>advocate</i> misogyny, nor that female <i>characters</i> must consider themselves powerless victims of consequence, since we all have mothers (even the king), we all have women we love and are loved by, and people do heroic things for people they love (which goes for all genders).  Meanwhile we all know stories of amazing heroic women throughout history, and we all know that women are responsible for - oh, about - fifty percent of all human activity and decision-making on Earth.<br/><br/>Most people's lives - male and female alike - are rather banal, regardless of historical period.<br/><br/>But those are not the people from whom our adventurous Player Characters (and major NPCs) tend to be drawn.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439472/#Comment_439472" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T21:25:57+00:00" title="October 15, 2014  9:25PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://aidanmoher.com/blog/featured-article/2013/05/we-have-always-fought-challenging-the-women-cattle-and-slaves-narrative-by-kameron-hurley/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://aidanmoher.com/blog/featured-article/2013/05/we-have-always-fought-challenging-the-women-cattle-and-slaves-narrative-by-kameron-hurley/</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439473/#Comment_439473" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T22:25:28+00:00" title="October 15, 2014 10:25PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome article!<br/><br/>Read it.<br/><br/>The llamas will thank you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439474/#Comment_439474" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T23:29:59+00:00" title="October 15, 2014 11:29PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a macro-historian (at least from my undergrad work) I'm all too familiar with the marginalization of females, especially in certain periods/cultures. While it's certain that there were still women 'doing things' even in these times it would have often been entirely different than when a man did the same things. Please note too that 'usual' and 'general' certainly don't mean always or everywhere. I also have to say that this is all little more than opinion/impression (which is really all most history can be), and the difference between reported history (compiled by certain biased sources) and the reality of the day as experienced by those oppressed by such people, is likely stark.<br/><br/>Sure Hypatia was a well placed and accomplished scientist, but she was marginalized, ridiculed, and eventually murdered on a whim (with nearly no repercussions). What's more, even before the religion issue her peers were largely skeptical or dismissive based largely upon pure gender differences.<br/><br/>Similarly brewsters/alewives were the norm for 2500 years, yet this 'skill' almost never resulted in a woman's prominence, or even freedom from near total subjugation at the whim of nearly any male in many cultures. Instead it was turned to an expected duty/role within the patriarchal society, similar to child bearing and other domestic duties. The law, being written largely by and for men, reinforced this in various ways (such as prohibitions against female inheritance).<br/><br/>None of this means that a female couldn't be an interesting pc/npc in a historically representative game, nor that roughly half (historically closer to 60% in fact, due to war and cultural expectation) of the background filler shouldn't be female. It DOES mean that to be believable the broader plot, interplay, and personal characterizations should acknowledge these limitations.<br/><br/>Possible routes to explore this would be some common tropes such as impersonating a male, having a puppet/show husband who was submissive or 'kept', being brilliant but humble or even obsequious to avoid confrontation, being a known outlaw/heretic, and so on. The possibilities should enhance roleplaying, not limit it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439476/#Comment_439476" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-16T02:49:31+00:00" title="October 16, 2014  2:49AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like historically accurate games because often times there is only one story allowed to female characters -- struggling against the patriarchy in order to earn significance and autonomy -- and that is boring to me. <br/><br/>That's why I'd rather play more escapist fiction with a broader set of roles, goals, and struggles for female characters -- the same set as their male counterparts. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439479/#Comment_439479" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-16T05:03:08+00:00" title="October 16, 2014  5:03AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2014 5:05AM by Rickard.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>None of this means that a female couldn't be an interesting pc/npc in a historically representative game, nor that roughly half (historically closer to 60% in fact, due to war and cultural expectation) of the background filler shouldn't be female.

I'm kind of tired of hearing this old defense of "historical accuracy" when I don't even think it's all that true anymore. It's just one perspective of the world, a common one, that is enforced over and over again. I can understand that people <i>think</i> that it's true and from their perspective it feels right, but I'm always suspicious when too many people say the same thing. What if it's a perspective that's not accurate but only true because a majority are enforcing it?<br/><br/>And what do one gain by having this? Verisimilitude?\n<blockquote>Possible routes to explore this would be some common tropes such as impersonating a male, having a puppet/show husband who was submissive or 'kept', being brilliant but humble or even obsequious to avoid confrontation, being a known outlaw/heretic, and so on. The possibilities should enhance roleplaying, not limit it.</blockquote>\nThis is the next step, if you want to be more inclusive when it comes to gender and breaking the male norm. I'm here myself, after around five years of having a equal share of females and males in my adventures. This above is what needs to be avoided. I mean, even the word "trope" is used above: "a common or overused theme or device" (Websters dictionary). Using a clich\xe9 would break my verisimilitude, no matter how historical accurate someone claims it is (claims, based on what?).<br/><br/>I'm currently breaking my own habits in mindlessly putting  women 1) in victimized roles, 2) as a sidekick to a man, or 3) as a tool to show a man's personality. I used to play in a gender-aware group with some women but a clear majority of men, but we still sometimes put all the female characters in the 50-50 blend into the three categories in the previous sentence.<br/><br/>Like I said, breaking that way of thinking is the next step into being more inclusive. Because after a while of forcing myself to include more women as characters, I realized that using the common tropes is equally bad as not including women at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Addicted2aa" title="Addicted2aa"><img alt="Addicted2aa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Addicted2aa">Addicted2aa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439484/#Comment_439484" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-16T09:16:45+00:00" title="October 16, 2014  9:16AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't like historically accurate games because often times there is only one story allowed to female characters -- struggling against the patriarchy in order to earn significance and autonomy -- and that is boring to me. <br/><br/>That's why I'd rather play more escapist fiction with a broader set of roles, goals, and struggles for female characters -- the same set as their male counterparts. <br/><br/><br/></blockquote>\nAren't matriarchal societies common in certain parts of the world well into the middle ages?

If you were a man, but you wore a smock and stayed at home cooking, you were considered a "woman". If you cut your hair short, wore pants, and carried a sword, you were called a "man", regardless of what was between your legs. That kind of thing.

I have a lot of respect for Victorian scholarship in general--the needle got moved a lot on the human progress meter during that time. But upper-class Victorian society was intensely homosocial and developed a mythology--the "Myth of Domesticity"--to justify that homosociality &amp; projected it backwards on human history. And it's truly breathtaking in its short-sightedness. Take my <i><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19800/midnight039s-voice-a-whitechapel-drama-cortex-" rel="nofollow">Midnight's Voice</a></i> campaign. <i>All</i> of the women in the East End worked.

A messenger walks through the door and announces that her grandfather has caught a cold, and therefore won't be able to attend the dinner that evening. Upon hearing this, the female heroine of the story promptly drops to the floor!<br/><br/>What? I've never seen that happen in real life. What's the deal?<br/><br/>While I was a student there, I used to have a part-time job at the Juilliard School in New York City. Each day I worked, I would see all the incident reports coming through the office. The school had a large number of young, healthy, fit, and badass women who were studying to be actors, singers, and dancers. (And the dancers - as well as some of the actors - in that program were some of the most incredible athletes I've ever met in my life. I remember seeing a stage production where an actor had to deliver a passionate monologue while holding up a cinder block in one hand while climbing a pole with the other. Crazy shit!) <br/><br/>Naturally, "fainting" was not a common incident, unless someone was suffering from anemia and had health complications at the same time, or something similarly unusual.<br/><br/>One day, they started rehearsals for an opera production where the women wore period costumes, including corsets.  As soon as the rehearsals moved into the stage where the women in the show had to wear corsets for "dress rehearsals", suddenly there were five or six incident reports coming in <i>every day</i>. So-and-so fainted while walking up the stairs. So-and-so fainted while trying to life a heavy box up onto a shelf. And so on.<br/><br/>These girls were fit and healthy, and only wore corsets for a few hours every day. Can you imagine how they might have felt if they were forbidden from any kind of exercise and forced to wear corsets almost daily, for years on end?<br/><br/>(Oh, and, of course, we'll drain off some of your blood now and then, to keep your complexion nice and pale.)<br/><br/>No wonder the Victorians had some strange ideas about the "weaker sex".

I'm kind of tired of hearing this old defense of "historical accuracy" when I don't even think it's all that true anymore. It's just one perspective of the world, a common one, that is enforced over and over again. I can understand that people <i>think</i> that it's true and from their perspective it feels right, but I'm always suspicious when too many people say the same thing. What if it's a perspective that's not accurate but only true because a majority are enforcing it?<br/><br/>And what do one gain by having this? Verisimilitude?</blockquote>\nWell, first off, everyone is different. We all have differing warrants, preferences and experiences that lead us to differing conclusions from the same source material. Nothing wrong with that, just leaves us needing to accept the differences rather than arrive at a singular objective 'reality'.<br/><br/>As for why it's believable to me, the bulk of available evidence (which I've already acknowledged for bias of course) supports it. It's not that it 'feels right' as in I think that's how things should naturally be. I think it's the only rational, logical conclusion of what was from the given evidence combined with my experiential reference of human nature and understanding of psychology. I find the counter evidence to be limited and specific, becoming the exceptions that prove the rule.<br/><br/>I share your trepidation of 'popular myth'. It's a big part of the reason I resist (and in fact am at war with) post-modernism. That reticence can't lead to becoming a denier however. 99% of people believe the WWII holocaust happened, does that mean we should disbelieve it despite any evidence? Of course not. It means we have to look at a broader range of evidence before confirming our participation in the belief. There's a pretty overwhelming body of evidence showing that women frequently been marginalized in most western cultures, with very little broad counter-evidence. That leaves little choice in what to view as more or less accurate. <br/><br/>Absolutely we gain verisimiltude, which is the necessary point for some (and wholly irrelevant to others). For me and our gaming group we cannot participate in things that don't 'ring true'. They don't have to be exact, but they have to be understandable (or overwhelmingly reasonable as an alternate reality). Without that we can't immerse, and without immersion we can't successfully portray (not to mention losing any potential for empathy via understanding). The more things depart from our own reality the more difficult it becomes to be able to account for how these differences would rationally impact behavior, beliefs, and preferences. Therefore the more familiar and believable a fictional society is, the easier it is to embrace the idea of dragons and magic into it.\n<blockquote><br/>This is the next step, if you want to be more inclusive when it comes to gender and breaking the male norm. I'm here myself, after around five years of having a equal share of females and males in my adventures. This above is what needs to be avoided. I mean, even the word "trope" is used above: "a common or overused theme or device" (Websters dictionary). Using a clich\xe9 would break my verisimilitude, no matter how historical accurate someone claims it is (claims, based on what?).<br/><br/>I'm currently breaking my own habits in mindlessly putting  women 1) in victimized roles, 2) as a sidekick to a man, or 3) as a tool to show a man's personality. I used to play in a gender-aware group with some women but a clear majority of men, but we still sometimes put all the female characters in the 50-50 blend into the three categories in the previous sentence.<br/><br/>Like I said, breaking that way of thinking is the next step into being more inclusive. Because after a while of forcing myself to include more women as characters, I realized that using the common tropes is equally bad as not including women at all.</blockquote>\nAnd what benefit is there in being inclusive? More importantly, what does that really mean? Please note, we probably don't want to 'go here' as it's a pretty loaded topic. I only said it as a reflection of your own inquiry regarding the value of verisimilitude or credibility of evidence to illustrate the existence of varying warrants.<br/><br/>We've always had regular female players in our groups who felt welcome and enjoyed themselves. Of course, they were of similar personality and outlook so they appreciated the realism and despised attempts at revisionism or false optimism for the purpose of inclusion (at least in other things, since our games never went there).<br/><br/>It breaks your verisimilitude because you don't agree with the probable reality of it (or at least, don't want that reality intruding into your fictionalized hobby). Which, by the way, is perfectly fine. In our groups we're largely scientists and academics who mostly believe the world is what the available evidence shows it to be when that evidence survives analysis. If you have some overwhelming body of credible evidence disproving, well, pretty much 99% of our recorded history I (and most all other historians) would love to study it.<br/><br/>See, there's a difference between 'mindlessly putting women' and 'rationally portraying a society', even if the outcome of each is the same. The first is sexism/misogyny, the second is rational awareness and understanding. This distinction forms the basis for the refutation of post-modernism in social movements and politics.<br/><br/>We are a group that prefers rational reflections of reality in our games. That is what makes the hobby enjoyable to us. You apparently prefer an idealized fiction in your games. That is what makes the hobby enjoyable to you. Both are correct, and both will attract women gamers to the games matching their own preferences.<br/><br/>Finally, though I've said it before several times, these generalities do not dictate specifics. There have always been extraordinary women and periods of exception just as there are matriarchal counterpoints to male-dominated societies. Likewise our games embrace this, allowing for the creation and portrayal of nearly anything. However, we do it always aware of the likely 'norm' in order to create a more realistic experience to aid immersion and thereby enjoyment. It's the exceptions that prove the rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439498/#Comment_439498" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-16T14:10:22+00:00" title="October 16, 2014  2:10PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2014 2:11PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.

Take out the mechs and tell me, "It's a straight up Jane Austen game" and I'm still in.<br/><br/>Victoriana described the social activism of the period and how many men and women of all classes were fighting for a better life for all, making me so eager to play a Victorian RPG that I was disappointed when the elves and magic showed up. (I got over that -- I love my laser sharks as much as the next gentle gamer.)<br/><br/>When I ran Kerberos Fate, the two women PCs had no desire to overturn the social rules of Victorian England. One of the men did, while the other was a Sherlock Holmes type, but less well socialized. Part of the reason we were using a Victorian setting (however inaccurate historically) is that we wanted to game in that setting, not in that setting as changed by PCs who all had 21st century sensibilities.<br/><br/>But, I can actually think of an actual, no laser sharks, historical game I played. At Dreamation, I was in a game of DramaSystem, using the Spanish Civil War setting. Three PCs, two of whom were women. Fighting against the patriarchy was... not in anyone's mind. Issues included dedication to the cause, Communism, Judaism and what it meant to one of the women, truth in reporting, supplies, working with other units, and treatment of enemy soldiers and non-coms. Did gender matter? Sure. Everything mattered. But, the game was never about "I must get respect from the patriarchy".<br/><br/>I've never played Steal Away Jordan, but I don't think that it focuses on that story either.<br/><br/>Lee Gold runs games with as much historic accuracy as she can easily bring in, apart from, you know, the magic of the culture and period being real. The people in those games have many stories open to them, including seeking revenge, seeking adventure or power, or seeking to live a good life.<br/><br/>So, yes, it may well be that too often, only one story is allowed to women PCs in historically accurate games. But, "allowed" -- by whom? By the players, including the game master, if any. We can change that.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439519/#Comment_439519" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T00:40:43+00:00" title="October 17, 2014 12:40AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2014 12:56AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More polite edit:<br/><br/>'The exception that proves the rule' means the exception that tests the rule.

For instance, in a culture where men are expected to accomplish something and hold power a random man doing so in a not unique way is almost never purposefully recorded. It's not 'noteworthy' because it's the norm (as reinforced by bulk evidence of major events or incidental pieces). Conversely, in that same system a woman accomplishing something out of gender norm is taken note of by some and often some version of it therefore survives to be known to us in detail.<br/><br/>When you combine a few of this fourth type with an overwhelming volume of the first three that show an opposing reality the ONLY logical extrapolation is that the contrary events are 'the exceptions that prove the rule'. If they weren't there would either be many, MANY more of them, or none at all.<br/><br/>Now obviously this does break down somewhat the further back we go, and the more limited the source material. But for macro issues (such as women's legal and social status during a several hundred year period for which we have <i>literally </i> tens or hundreds of thousands of pieces of supporting evidence) the only deniers are those with mental issues or seeking to utilize a form of revisionist social engineering (usually for laudable goals). There simply is <b>NO </b>other rational conclusion possible, which is why most experts dismiss them. There is NO honest contention of these issues in academia for this reason. It's not a conspiracy, and it's not groupthink...it's as close to fact as social science is able to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439525/#Comment_439525" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T05:32:04+00:00" title="October 17, 2014  5:32AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use two techniques.

Sure, someone like Julie d'Aubigny is a really unusual case, and hardly the norm. (Still, I would think that the vast majority of RPG characters are not "average people", no?*)<br/><br/>But in any scenario, no matter how "realistic", there will be lots of important female characters. (With the exception of some kind of War Room meeting, "no womens allowed" boys' club, of course - but in most life situations, there are both men and women, no question.)<br/><br/>I once played a wonderful and totally historical accurate Victorian drama about a family dealing with the death of the aging Lord. All were gathered for a funeral of sorts, and to sort out the will: who would inherit what? There was a local priest, children, grandparents, a military officer from the war, a merchant from London (female), and the Lord's wife was the domineering matriarch who ran the show. There was also a bit of a murder mystery to solve.<br/><br/>Perfectly believable scenario, very historically accurate. Lots of important and influential female characters. <br/><br/>Is there some reason this would not fly at your hypothetical table?<br/><br/><br/><br/>*: In pretty much any kind of RPG, there will be lots of unusual abilities and attributes. For instance, in D&amp;D, a veteran warrior can have 100 hit points, and survive battle after battle. Is there something "masculine" about hit points, which means that a woman in this game can't enjoy the same advantages? No. Exceptionalism shouldn't be gender-based - if the characters are unusual and special, then that's plenty of justification for women being unusual and special. Magic, special abilities, unusual backgrounds... these are all great tools to level the playing field, and I see no reason to apply them only to a subset of the human race.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439536/#Comment_439536" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T12:28:16+00:00" title="October 17, 2014 12:28PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Of course, my players described the world as a matriarchy</blockquote>\nOn one level, that's not a great surprise.

I'll tell you about my favourite Finnish rpg that I didn't have a hand in myself:<br/><br/>As you know, indie gaming is about doing your own shit, in ways that would not get done with somebody else's money. One of the more amusing examples of that here in Finland is <a href="http://noitahovi.jimdo.com/" rel="nofollow">Noitahovi</a> ("The Court of Witches"), a roleplaying game published a couple years back by Tuomas Kortelainen, one of our best and brightest.<br/><br/>Noitahovi is one of those games that started with a setting - for a time Tuomas was considering marrying it up with the <i>Solar System</i>, in fact, before deciding to finish this tight blood opera thing heavily reminiscent of a combination of TSoY and <i>Dust Devils</i>. The setting was the thing, though: an alternate history fantasy set in 14th century Finland, or "The Northlands" as the area is known in this heavily alternative world. The world of the game doesn't really resemble our own in any except the broad outline of geography and culture, because of the one deviation it features: magic exists, and women are naturally just a little bit better at it.<br/><br/>So, of course that alone isn't such a fresh idea. However, as it happens, the Mongol invasion (or rather, the invasion of "Nathars", the alternate universe Mongol-equivalents) of Europe in the 13th century was apparently successful over all expectations (a lot of implied history here that the game doesn't go into), as now the Northlands, which are the sort of shamanistic, sparsely populated land you'd expect, are basically ruled as a Mongol province, and while Christianity (or rather, the alternate-universe feminine equivalent, the church of Cybele) is a cultural force to be reckoned with, the cultural confusion brought about by an eastern conquest has brought on a resurgence of all sorts of paganism as well. So a lot of cultural and religious stuff boiling in the Northlands, pretty provocative for a Finnish audience (we've sort of got a chip on our collective shoulders about eastern conquerors and national identity).<br/><br/>The cultural stuff works out the way you'd expect of a Solar System setting supplement, with PCs being combined out of ethnic and religious building-blocks, but the actually interesting part of the game is how it is technically a well-executed blood opera fantasy setting, basically equivalent to the <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, except that the world culture is exactly as female-oriented as ours is oriented towards men: women hold positions of authority, women are assumed as the measure of humanity, and so on. It's a setting that enables male PCs and such exactly as much as your average historically-oriented fantasy game enables female characters. It's not anything overt like women holding big magical pageants to cow the men, or magic suddenly having come into the world a few generations back to mess everything up, or anything of the sort; this is just how the world has always been, everywhere and for everyone.<br/><br/>(Actually, that Houses of the Blooded comparison is pretty good in general here for the international audience: Noitahovi is like if Houses of the Blooded had an elegantly narrativistic blood opera rules set, and featured a socially realistic female-dominant society.)<br/><br/>The point is, let me tell you - that simple premise about a female-dominant blood opera setting is hilarious, and surprisingly entertaining. You can play butch warrior types, cunning courtiers, primitive shamans, pacifistic holy people, whatever you'd expect as the usual choices, but the odds are that you'll be playing women. Of course you can play a man (the mechanical hit isn't really that bad), but everything in the game works to subtly remind the group about your societal status, so probably your character's story will be one of struggling against social expectations and making your own way in a world intended for the stronger gender.<br/><br/>I could see how this sort of game could be annoyingly ham-fisted about its point, but Noitahovi is so diligent about the non-gender elements, while making the point about gender in an understated manner, that it works quite naturally. Makes the usual blood opera drama stuff pretty fresh, with women in all the leading roles; either you do "male stories" insofar as the societal roles prescribe those stories, or you break down those stories and do something completely different because "a woman wouldn't act that way in that situation". (Or you do male stories about staying at home and subtly influencing your powerful female relatives - that works, too.) Either way, difficult to get bored even for an old drama queen, as the gender reversal forces you to actively reconsider all the petty details about even relatively rote stories. It wouldn't be half as interesting if the game just mandated that "women shall act like men and vice versa to the smallest detail", but as this is not what it does - the point is that there are specific historical and cultural institutions that have swung the gender balance to favour women throughout the history of the world, not that women are men with an uterus - the game largely leaves it up to the players to figure out what the society of the Northlands actually looks like.<br/><br/>Also, to be explicit about one of the best parts of the game's design: it would have been <i>so</i> easy to decide that only the Mongols are matriarchal, or only the local Sami tribes have powerful witch women, or make the game be about gender war in some other way, so the players would get to choose which gender to fight for. It's just perfect how the game presents this dramatic clash of cultures setup rife for revolutions or whatever, and thus smuggles the much more aggressively provocative gender switch in under our eyes. As you read the game's setting book and try to figure out who are the good guys, you've already pretty much accepted the matriarchal world-view, because all the choices on the ballot are women <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439543/#Comment_439543" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T13:57:19+00:00" title="October 17, 2014  1:57PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I was so busy fanboy-ing about Noitahovi that I forgot to connect to the earlier discussion: remember how up there I connected the back-handed tendency towards male-dominant fantasy to a historical romance aesthetic? That is, many people don't want aggressively egalitarian game worlds because they're interested in social realism, and aggressive egalitarianism is not that.<br/><br/>So Noitahovi here, it tickles my funny-bone quite well regarding this historical romanticism thing: it doesn't <i>feel</i> like plastic corporate pablum to me despite featuring a very different gender balance from the historical. I explained how the game works it in some detail, so you can see for yourself how the game's speculative fiction elements attach to the historical and romantic bits typical of the fantasy genre. It still speaks about humanity: it doesn't say "let's ignore gender for now for the sake of elfgames", but rather it fronts that whole cluster of issues for play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439587/#Comment_439587" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-21T15:04:41+00:00" title="October 21, 2014  3:04PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I still don't really understand this argument.

That's a little bit silly, because there should be situations where there are only one gender present.<br/><br/>What I think is important is to change the perspective. Everyone in history were oppressed. They had to follow social expectations. If someone constantly think of women as oppressed in history, how will that person think of women in the stories that are taking place? Like the link said that <a href="/forums/profile/Lisa_Padol">@Lisa_Padol</a> gave: all poor people worked - men as women.<br/><br/>What's "important"? When I said that women can be leader of the guard, mad scientist or doctors, I thought mainly of 19th century or fantasy. If you want to be more historically correct, why look at positions? Why is a scientist more important for the story than someone who washes clothes? The first are the persons who are talked about in history. The latter ... not so much. But I'm talking about creating fiction here and gender-equality is about making men and women taking up roughly as much space in the scenario.<br/><br/>Having women in your group doesn't automatically make your games more inclusive. I'm kind of tired of the thought that just because you add a woman, they will come with the pure insights just because they are women. All humans are fed with the same stories and all of them accept the lack of women in these stories. Being inclusive is to create an awareness around this to break a learned pattern. Again, in the link that Lisa gave, the author said that her 16 year old self based her argument of that women shouldn't be at war because they are women.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439819/#Comment_439819" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-30T19:23:55+00:00" title="October 30, 2014  7:23PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2014 7:26PM by Rob_Alexander.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Actually, on Rickard's second point, there are issues here with social status - realistic for there to be many women, not so realistic for them to occupy positions of high status.

I feel this to be worthwhile because this objection is trotted out all the time, so apparently there are a huge number of people out there who genuinely don't understand why you might want to have dragons, yet not have utopian gender relations in the same work.<br/><br/>The reason why somebody might draw the line at gender roles, yet not at dragons and magic, is that they may be going for the literary genre of "historical romanticism", which continues to live as what is commonly called "vanilla fantasy". This genre of fantasy is often sort of misrepresented as being "about" elves and dwarves and dragons and magic, when it's actually more about something that I like to characterize as a romantic longing for a mythical past when men were heroes, swords were swords and horses were transportation.</blockquote>\n<br/>Eero - what you're saying is quite compatible with what I wrote (in my previous post here and in my G+ post). You don't make your fantasy worlds gender-egalitarian, because you prioritise other things higher, and those things conflict with gender-egalitarianism. In my G+ post, I explicitly don't say "realism in fantasy is bunk, because dragons etc" - that extreme form of the argument is silly. It's a cheap shot, and easily refuted. But I <i>do</i> say that realism is mutable in response to other constraints and values, and that in choosing how to do that we say something about ourselves and our priorities.<br/><br/>That something mirrors an existing genre, regardless of its literary or other value, doesn't grant it special status in that regard. There is perhaps something here that I have missed, but I don't see it yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439837/#Comment_439837" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-31T16:01:56+00:00" title="October 31, 2014  4:01PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One character type I've been introducing occasionally is an older woman in a position of power.
