The delegation, which includes the beautiful aqua-skinned Princess Naalil, is there to request assistance with the space blockade that the Crimson Republic has imposed upon them.  A quartet of Tachyon violinists on a nearby platform plays an inviting processional. <br/><br/>As Mayor Victoria Woodhull steps forward to greet the delegates, a trio of large mysterious sky bikes uncloak.  The bikes carry pairs of humanoids of indeterminate origin wearing red flight suits with opaque shielded helmets.  One of them blasts the mayor with a bolt of blue energy from the bike, one swoops down to grab Princess Naalil, and the third duo menaces the delegation, firing bolts randomly into the crowd.<br/><br/><b>4 Normal Threats: Red Cyclist Duos </b>(WHO are they?!?  Maybe the Previously Ons will give us a hint!)<br/><br/><b>1 Major Threat: Princess Naalil's Being Abducted!</b> Countdown 3, Resistance 2 (This Threat's Resistance decrements 1 each time a Cyclist Duo is eliminated and is eliminated if all the Cyclist Duos are eliminated)<br/><br/><b>1 Major Threat: Mayor Woodhull's Been Shot!</b> Countdown 2 (She's convulsing with blue energy!  Is she dying?!?  Is she being <i>transformed</i>?!?)<br/><br/>Possible Threat Moves: Tachyon instrument interaction with blue energy; mind-controlled Mayor; musicians toppled from platform; an explosion aboard the zeppelin.  And of course whatever the players introduce!<br/><br/>Above defaulted for three players; adjust Threats to taste or number of players.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220643/#Comment_220643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T14:11:54+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  2:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2009 2:26PM by John_Harper.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (FYI: In Rocket City, the Mayor is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Woodhull" rel="nofollow">Victoria Woodhull</a>.

Just behind the throne, her uncle, Duke Lokesh, speaks under his breath -- the words repeated in a booming voice from the Princess:<br/><br/>"Invaders from the Red World! You have been found guilty of espionage and acts of war against the Sapphire Throne of Saturn! I hereby sentence you all... TO DEATH!"<br/><br/>The Danger Patrol heroes are each chained to a jade post on floating platforms outside the faceted windows and jeweled balconies of the throne room tower.<br/><br/>Descending from the planet's iridescent rings come fearsome creatures out of myth -- terrible monsters fought only by the bravest of Ring Knights -- six-winged Crystal Dragons!<br/><br/><b>1 Crystal Dragon per hero (normal threats).</b> Each have Resistance 2 as long as the Aura of Urgosh is in effect.<br/><br/><b>The Sapphire Throne (major threat, countdown 2).</b> It's doing something to the Princess!<br/><br/><b>The Aura of Urgosh (major threat)</b>. A strange blue light permeating the chamber. It gives Resistance 2 to the Dragons.<br/><br/>Possible Threat Moves: A dragon swallows a hero; the Aura of Urgosh turns some of the courtiers into mystic puppets; the crowd panics;  the throne room tower collapses; someone falls into the crushing lower depths of Saturn's atmosphere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold" title="kaptainkobold"><img alt="kaptainkobold" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold">kaptainkobold</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223505/#Comment_223505" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T06:33:21+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  6:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2009 9:44PM by kaptainkobold.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-size: larger; font-size: larger;"><b>EPISODE 5 - ROCKETSHIP RESCUE!</b></span><br/><br/>A distress signal has been picked up! The Danger Patrol blast off from Rocket City in their rocketship to investigate. As they near the moon of Phobos, they see an out-of -control rocketship hurtling towards Mars. Its trajectory will cause it to crash into the heart of Rocket City!<br/><br/>They fly to intercept it, but as they do so dark shapes emerge from behind the Martian moon - enormous space-bats!<br/><br/><b>One Space Bat per hero (normal threats)</b> You must get past the bats to get at the ship.<br/><br/><b>Crashing Rocketship (major threat, countdown 3)</b><br/><br/><b>The Moon of Phobos.</b> Mostly for scenery, but a possible prop.<br/><br/>I have left the nature of the bats and the ship, and the relationship between them, totally open. The bats could be simple space predators, or could be dark creatures from another dimension. The ship could have a crew waiting to be rescued, or could be mysteriously unmanned. It's up to the Danger Patrol to work it all out.<br/><br/>Possible threats: Atmospheric re-entry, debris from the stricken ship, a meteor shower, Phobos being nudged out of orbit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277148/#Comment_277148" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T14:45:55+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  2:45PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2010 4:17PM by nemomeme.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EPISODE 37: NEPTUNIAN EATERS OF TIME</b><br/><br/>Our Danger Patrol heroes are seated around a long banquet table in the grand salon of the Nemo, a Lima class submersible on an excursion beneath the waves on the planet Neptune.  Queen Zithia and select members of her court are present, as is a delegation from Triton.<br/><br/>Also present are a number of unwelcome guests: Lobster-esque Lurg warriors surround the table each of them with one arm gripping deadly axes and the other arm a menacing pincer.  A mysterious humanoid in a deep sea suit stands near an entrance.  In an echoing voice, \u201cLet none of them survive!!!\u201d He aims a strange device at the ceiling of the salon and a blue energy envelops the transparent rectangle of glassite overhead.  An enormous Lurg warrior with a trident riding a giant white lobster falls through the portal along with a torrent of water and lands directly in front of the queen.  Simultaneously, the wall speakers blare from the bridge, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with the trim tanks!  We\u2019ve got Hyper-Negative Buoyancy!!!\u201d<br/><br/>The mysterious figure whirls and exits to the stern side corridors of the Nemo as Danger Patrol leaps into action!<br/> <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bridge Location:</span><br/><b>Major Threat: Headed for the Deep!

Rivets pop as the Nemo descends.  Anything further about this situation should be informed by the players' "Previously Ons," but Uldar is likely trying to capture a Neptunian Time Sphere which he needs to re-awaken the Chronos Kraken.  He may serve Kor-Mak the Time Flayer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
