Chaos quickly reigned as inconvenient gods and fiancees were dealt with more or less, the fabric of reality itself was threatened (several times!), and the conniving thief got his heart's desire, good and hard!  There was a lot of conflict of various sorts, but no actual combat.<br/><br/>As usual, I asked the players questions by email between games.  The questions and their responses before this game were: <br/><br/><b>Light Inverse, Master of the Wrath of Abraxas</b>:<ol>\n<li>Who was the last person to unlock the Mobius Flower? </li>\n<li>Did he survive the process? In what condition?<br/><i>If anyone has unlocked the M\xf6bius Flower since the founder of the Guild of Passions locked it, they have not survived to tell the tale. No one knows definitively where it has been between Eustace the Rogue 370 years ago and Thunder-in-Silence this year. However, I'm sure we could persuade our demi-god to answer a few questions...</i></li>\n<li>Are the terms "innocent bystanders" or "collateral damage" just words to you?<br/><i>Much of a mage's philosophical debate is just words.  Who is truly innocent? Where is the fine line between bystander and accomplice by inaction? Intent, as in all magiks, is key to this question. Was it the mage's intent to harm innocents? Was it the mage's intent to include bystanders in the attack, or were they merely collateral damage? How much effort did the mage waste in trying to minimize collateral damage?<br/><br/>However, when it comes to the Zero Spell, there is no collateral damage. Not because innocents aren't likely to be effected, but because the spell is so absolute in its nature. The intent, when cast, is to harm all in its path, regardless of their state in life and their relationship to the mage. How many innocents can die at the hands of the Zero Spell and yet leave a mage with a clear conscience? Luckily for them, lesser mages do not have to answer that question with their soul, merely their intellectual curiosity.</i></li></ol>\n<b>Tim</b>:<ol>\n<li>What do you have planned for you and Shadowy's (The Lord of Shadows) 3rd date? <br/><i>No plans.</i></li>\n<li>Those guys from the Red Scorpion Battalion aren't really following you around, right? <br/><i>Hell, I dunno.</i></li>\n<li>You're getting letters from Sheela the Pirate Queen -- are you reading them? <br/><i>Fuck no!</i></li></ol>\n<b>Lord Woodchuck Stingray, Viscount of Shadows</b>:<ol>\n<li>After last time, surely someone owes you a title -- who? <br/><i>Better to ask who does not. I have proved myself invaluable to the Lord of Shadows yet again; a promotion would be most appropriate. I helped deliver the errant demigod into the hands of Illuminata's holy order; a bishopric or other title would seem fitting. I secured the Mobius Flower and bestowed it upon my loyal retainer Mr. Inverse, who, while not directly able to grant me a title, certainly could arrange matters to our mutual benefit. Perhaps we shall go forth and conquer new lands for me to rule and him to study as he wishes. And Tim's university should see about granting me some honorary degrees or a professorial position (with stipend) as soon as possible. After all, I am providing an unparalleled educational experience to their promising pupil free of charge. </i></li>\n<li>What possible uses have you figured out for the Tyrant Demi-God, Thunder-in-Silence? <br/><i>Hmm, other than the obvious lightning-throwing pyrotechnics sufficient to awe the masses, I had not given it much thought. Much will depend upon how he responds to Illuminata's conversion. I suppose he also could be a bargaining chip with his exalted mother, Tempest-Becalmed, who would undoubtedly be interested in his welfare. </i></li>\n<li>You've been seeing Red Scorpion Battalion troupers out of the corner of your eyes occasionally.  What, if anything, do you do about this? <br/><i>It may be time now to see about the ritual that is rumored to be able to bind the spirit of their founder under my authority. Yes, it requires a wizard and a priest working in concert, but with my current retinue it should be a small task. Then, I can assert control over the Red Scorpions and wield their might in securing my legacy and leisure.</i></li></ol>\n<b>lluminata Zygmunt</b>:<ol>\n<li>What sort of place is your temple located in (little village, town, big city)?  And what's the place's name? <br/><i>The Temple of the Moon is located in the heart of the jungle of Kriis. The priests of this temple tend to their own needs so there is really not much of a village. </i></li>\n<li>Are you in charge of it? If not, who is? <br/><i>Oh heck no. I have a tendency to break things. The priest Sol-tin is in charge. </i></li>\n<li>Where are you confining Thunder-in-Silence while you're trying to convert him? <br/><i>He will be taken to the difficult conversion cell (DCC) beneath the Temple of the Moon.</i></li></ol>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395928/#Comment_395928" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T13:50:13+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  1:50PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Further thoughts on above:<br/><br/>I found myself sort of conflating the old boss fight rules and the clue/mcguffin rules for an extended conversational battle (trying to convince the baddies to go hero questing to fix the sun).

This is the type of thing that used to happen when I played online in the WOD chats, and it was like, maybe two or three people roleplaying in a room. It was often an "afterplay" type scenario, the GM just threw some major drama and plot points at you, but the GM wasn't around anymore, so what do you do? You have your characters sit with that drama and play out the aftermath of it.<br/><br/>Our Ghoul had just been killed by the ocean called up by our Selkie. The Selkie's pelt was taken at the same time, and is currently missing. When the Ghoul washed up on shore, our Werewolf took care of him, but this is the third time he's died. His father erased all memories of us last time, and made him into someone new. He doesn't remember any relationships at all with us. Our Fae is scared to death of him, because he saw him turn into his darkest self and eat a police officer. Our Fae and our Selkie are still hooking up (two teenage boys exploring their newly lost virginity). Tension grows between the Werewolf and the Selkie, after the Werewolf learned the Selkie tried to kill the Ghoul. There was a violent confrontation between the two, where the Werewolf asserted her overprotectiveness of the Ghoul, and a weird love/hate tension grows between the two.<br/><br/>I feel like I need to draw a relationship map/timeline for all our twisted love/hate/monster triangles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396710/#Comment_396710" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T10:59:47+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 10:59AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I feel like I need to draw a relationship map/timeline for all our twisted love/hate/monster triangles.</blockquote>\nPlease do!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396834/#Comment_396834" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-08T06:54:20+00:00" title="November  8, 2012  6:54AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa, stop forcing me to have lonely fun with my Monsterhearts game! <br/><br/>... ok now I may have to do this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396877/#Comment_396877" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-08T17:26:47+00:00" title="November  8, 2012  5:26PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Once upon a time...</b><br/><br/>Best game I had in a loooong time.

Following that, as Todd Bryant (former VP candidate and presumptive nominee for 2016) I negotiated our way through blocking the appointment of a Supreme Court nominee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397058/#Comment_397058" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-10T18:04:32+00:00" title="November 10, 2012  6:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ran a playtest of Kingdom yesterday.

And it was a good game.  But those playsets felt a little bit more generic.  Flyover has a little more material in there to spur on the imagination.  The flyover playset has little narrative threads that run through the various elements, that let you take them and build things.  So Marcy Lowell shows up in a lot of games of Flyover, and she's always terrible in beautiful, awful ways.  And the airport is always involved in smuggling or drug dealing or something.  Or the Mexican drug dealers and the tear stained letter written in badly broken Spanish...<br/><br/>Flyover also gives you a small town setting.  Everyone knows each other, at least a little. The small town setting means that there's plenty of isolated spots and abandoned run down barns to hide your meth labs in.  But it's not the crazy isolation of The Ice (another great playset), so you can still go into town and have a shootout in the community health center or whatever.  I can picture Flyover country in my head and spin out cool specific details real quickly and easily without them feeling like I'm just using stock, generic settings.<br/><br/>Of course, Flyover is also the first playset that I played, so maybe it's a mental reaction to the discovery of something new.  It's also the playset I've played the most (five or six times at least) which may also relate to my liking it.<br/><br/>Flyover has never failed to give me a great setup and an entertaining game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397278/#Comment_397278" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-12T18:49:41+00:00" title="November 12, 2012  6:49PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World: Refugees from a town taken over by The Pile are stacked up on a promontory of Black Marsh, surrounded by the river on three sides and the deep swamp on the fourth.

I wasn't sure what to expect. I had scheduled a Monsterhearts game for Thursday night, which no one signed up for (nothing against Monsterhearts -- it was my first year at this convention, so I didn't realize that was the "quiet" night). I'd scheduled another Monsterhearts session for last night that got two players, but we thought it would be better with at least three, so we opted for Mice and Mystics (good game, though more of a traditional board game). So, imagine my surprise when I wound up MCing <b>SIX </b>players today. And it went really well overall!<br/><br/>We had Wendy, the Mortal, who was in love with Gerard, the Witch, but being pursued by Levi, the fairly inappropriate Werewolf. Varun, the Queen, was the local gang leader, who had dozens of students working for him as drug runners, prostitutes and even murderers. One of their murder victims, had been dug up and had various body parts (including her very recognizable face) be used for a reanimated Ghoul, Georgia. Rounding out the PCs was the newest student, Adam, a Hollow (actually an android, just brought to life a month or so ago). There was also a murderer running around who had (so far) offed two female students and kidnapped another. In the end, the cuprit was nerdy student, Joey, who ended up being Adam's maker and Georgia's reanimator. He was killed, but not before transfering his consciousness to another body.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b><br/>Five-player game using the White Hole playset. We were on a space station next to a white hole (which, we found out later, had been created by the dispassionately observing captain as a scientific experiment). There was a strong religious element to this one with two androids programmed to be basically fanatics to their god, Ungo. Another human (a mean-spirited maintenance manager) was so into her religion that she believed the various visions she had of Ungo in view screens across the space station; he told her that the fabled Utopian Forever land was on the other side of the white hole and to reach it, she would need to 1) ensure no one else escaped the space station and 2) atone for being mean to her underling employee. That employee was in love and partners in crime with a war traitor on the station who had his own means of escape. In the end, both crew members were dead, one android was on the other side of the white hole in isolated silence, and the other android and remaining human were imprisoned. Oh, and it turns out that the "god" people kept seeing in computer screens was a mischevious computer virus set some time ago and run wild! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398004/#Comment_398004" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T16:00:41+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  4:00PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Final game I played at the Kansas City Game Fair: Durance.

The storyline involved a love triangle between a bland Marine Captain, his scheming and power-hungry wife, and her ex-fiance, a disgraced gene manipulator who was imprisoned and now served as the Dimber Damber. Other notable characters included a well-known anarchist whose violent crimes had landed her on the prison, a guard who was a former follower of said anarchist, and a con-man convict who used this knowledge to his advantage, eventually becoming a marine.

This is only the third time I've played Fiasco, and it finally sung for me. Part of it was probably pacing; we had five players so I was absolutely ruthless about cutting scenes and we finished in 2.5 hours. Watching the Tabletop episodes helped, too--having almost notional scenes. Anyway!<br/><br/>Des and Meesh, friends bonded over a film club, hate their cheating husbands and hatch a plan at a bachelorette party to murder them. Eventually, all four of our Hollywood Wives become implicated, wanting to murder their husbands, too (even the bride-to-be), with the fifth player being the knowledgeable one, having <i>already</i> murdered her husband. The attempt involves a flaming golf cart falling off a cliff. It goes great! Except the golf cart doesn't have the husbands in it.<br/><br/>One wife goes to jail, three end up poor, living in L.A. and wearing jeans (gasp!), while my character made out like a bandit, taking her husband for everything he had after she caught him cheating.

The long overdue transport arrived and the Bolter Rhone Haylow and her crew took it over to escape our little hellhole of a colony, leaving a repentant group in charge who'd overthrown an Authority that had been at turns eating and making sex slaves of the natives (shudder).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398970/#Comment_398970" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T04:46:33+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  4:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2012 4:47AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            High Quality Roleplaying: Tavern wench and occasional magic dentist Edith Tongs busts her lover James Cooper out of gaol; they then fight a werewolf.

Her protective older brother, her kind-hearted suitor, and the village preacher went in to find her.  None of the four ever emerged from the woods.  Did you think they would?  <i>The name of the game says not to walk in the woods.</i>  But the real takeaway here is that the preacher used Bible pages as a funnel to pour black powder down a skinwalker's throat before shoving a torch in its face.  So he had that going for him, which was good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399089/#Comment_399089" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T04:52:37+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  4:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you walk in Winter Wood you have <i>voided the warranty on your life</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399152/#Comment_399152" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T13:47:47+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  1:47PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of fun quotes in Kerberos Fate, but I admit my favorite was the meta. Back in January, Josh (who plays Alice) wrote a filksong about Kristen's character, Sophronia, the clockwork fairy, which contains the lines: "I make my own illusions / I want no other sham".<br/><br/>The group was talking with a dreamcrafter, and he offered to craft a dream for Sophronia, who has never dreamed.<br/><br/>Sophronia: What is dreaming like? I sometimes sit on Talos's shoulder and sing to him.<br/><br/>Alice: You've been in a dream with us. (Technically true -- it was someone else's dream.)<br/><br/>Sophronia: Oh. Is it always like that?<br/><br/>Chorus: No!<br/><br/>Sophronia: I don't think I want to have a dream.<br/><br/>Alice: A dream can be unpleasant, but it can also be pleasant. That may an advantage to having the dream be crafted.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Do you know, I make my own illusions?<br/><br/>Josh: Hey! Awwww!
