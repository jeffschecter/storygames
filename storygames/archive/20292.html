I am considering making if you roll at least 2 dice that are equal to your number you get "Fear and Reason". <br/><br/>What are yours (or anyone reading this) thoughts on this?<br/><br/>(I have not played Lasers &amp; Feelings enough to have an opinion on the rules as written)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447269/#Comment_447269" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-27T11:30:44+00:00" title="July 27, 2015 11:30AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played L&amp;F at all, so I really don't know. Any die seems a bit high for this sort of game, though. "Special insight" becomes less special if it happens a lot, it would seem. Then again it's hardly a superpower, so maybe it doesn't matter. Seems like one might run out of relevant questions if there are many rolls in a scene, though. Two dice on the number seems good, too. Alternatives:<br/><br/>* Any two dice match. This would still make it impossible to get it at 1 die, but more likely to get it at 2 or 3.<br/><br/>* Have a "default" die that is always rolled, and only that die will get you a special insight. This would make skill irrelevant and get you insight on one of six rolls, regardless.<br/><br/>Or maybe you want special insight to be harder when you use more dice, to encourage players to not just use their specialties?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447481/#Comment_447481" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T15:13:05+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  3:13PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love what you did with L&amp;F, Jim!<br/><br/>Laser Feelings are very cool IMO, I would change that. What becomes boring is rolling again after the laser feeling questions got answered. What if a laser feeling comes up again? Duh... After a few sessions, we played this way:<br/><br/>If you dont change your action, just roll again with the laser feeling dice(s).<br/>If you cange your action, roll again with all of your dices.<br/>In any case, a newly rolled laser feeling is a hit (coz you have some advantage).<br/><br/>Other thoughs:<br/>* Insanity rules are great!!!<br/>* Clue rules... I personally dont get it. We always played these sort of games that players can declare things even without a clue token. Maybe we played them wrong, but still, the rule seems a bit clunky. When should the GM give clue tokens to players and how? To every player? Etc. <br/>* L&amp;F has an important feature: an obliviously cool starting point. But F&amp;R doesnt have one. This way it's harder to start awesome gaming for new GMs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jimllusionist" title="Jimllusionist"><img alt="Jimllusionist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jimllusionist">Jimllusionist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447482/#Comment_447482" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T15:28:43+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  3:28PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the feedback!  <br/><br/>In the newer version i have made it so  that to use the Fear and Reason mechanic you must also spend a clue token. <br/><br/>I'm realizing the limitations of having only one page for rules. The clue token is meant to encourage players to actively investigate the scenario. They're meant to be given out whenever a player actively describes how they're investigating a scene. I realize that some players may already contribute to describing the world around them in story games, the clue token is meant to encourage that even more. There's a few more mechanics that I'm adding to the game which will describe more in detail the use of Clue tokens.<br/><br/>I hadn't thought of sort of a starting off point the way you mentioned, it's something to consider and I'll have to think about it to come up with a quick little jumping off point. Please keep in mind but this game is still very much in beta and I am constantly looking at ways to expand and improve it in such a way but it does not bog down a perfectly elegant system with a bunch of rules that doesn't need.<br/><br/>Thank you again for the feedback you've given me something to think about                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448202/#Comment_448202" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-24T18:36:08+00:00" title="August 24, 2015  6:36PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where can I find the newest version?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jimllusionist" title="Jimllusionist"><img alt="Jimllusionist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jimllusionist">Jimllusionist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448244/#Comment_448244" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-27T16:41:57+00:00" title="August 27, 2015  4:41PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently getting ready to launch a Kickstarter for an RPG documentary, as soon as that launches I'll put out a new revised version of Fear &amp; Reason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
