We're planning to play again next week, and then we'll see where it goes.  <br/><br/>Because we have seven in our group, we needed an extra character, so we used John Powell's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9882&amp;page=1#Item_4" rel="nofollow">Saraphina Wright</a>, with some slight modifications.  Instead of the Key of the Vow we gave her a Hidden Longing for Kale Arkham, just to tie things together a bit.<br/><br/>We started off with everyone in the brig of the Sorrow except Lady Blackbird, who had managed to hide in the secret cargo compartments on the Owl.  While the rest of the crew and her bodyguard were interviewed and ultimately escaped their cells, she tried to stay hidden and disguised.  She was soon discovered by the Imperials, however, and rather than endure their filthy touch, she used her magic to channel fire and burn the marines to ashes.<br/><br/>Captain Vance used his commanding nature and knowledge of the empire to convince two marines to escort them to the hangar deck.  By the time they arrived, an alarm had sounded- a result of the fire aboard the Owl, and the dead marines there.  During the confusion, Snargle changed shape and slipped through the crowd to get aboard his ship, and Vance used his marines as cover for the others.  At least until Captain Hollas arrived and arrested him, again.  <br/><br/>The crew rushed for the gangplank separating the open hangar of the Sorrow from the Owl.  Naomi fought the marines while the others got on board, leaving the captain in the hands of the Imperials. Kale used his petty magics to shatter almost all of the mooring lines as Snargle dived.  One chain still tied the ships together.<br/><br/>As the others escaped, Captain Hollas threatened Vance with a pistol and the destruction of his ship if he didn't command them to surrender.  For his part, Vance tried (and failed) to convince Hollas that their cargo was too dangerous to take chances with, and that the imperials should let them go.  Meanwhile, Snargle powered the smaller vessel hard under the other, using the mooring line to haul the Sorrow over.  The resulting shift threw dozens of men out of the hangar and into the Blue, screaming as they fell into the Depths below.  Among them was captain Vance.<br/><br/>While Snargle tried to save some of the doomed men, Vance teleported himself on board the ship.  The Owl dived into the depths as the Sorrow fired a broadside and prepared to drop depth charges into the mists.  Kale threw up his hands at the holes in the hull from cannon fire, and the corrosive atmosphere leaking in.  In a bid to throw off pursuit, they launched the Lady's passenger quarters (a modular pod) from the ship with a pressure charge- just after Naomi rescued the Lady's belongings.  One of these items was a portrait of Urias, coded with the path through the Remnants.<br/><br/>Once free from the Sorrow, the characters had a moment to catch their breath.  Refreshment scenes were had all around, and this is when we learned that Seraphina could communicate with the squids (as she took a load of pills and locked herself in the turret to "dreamtalk" with them).  We also saw a flashback to Vance's days in the empire, when he attended a formal ball and first met a young Lady Blackbird.  Though he had the impertinence to ask her for a dance, she was oblivious.  His commanding officer was not.<br/><br/>Later Snargle was surprised to find that while they rested a sky squid had quietly wrapped itself around the ship, holding it in a frightening embrace.  While the others made plans to charge the hull or shoot it with harpoons, Seraphina made contact with it and convinced it to carry them through the depths to Nightport.  <br/><br/>By the time they had arrived, the Owl was in terrible shape.  Kale convinced the captain that 20 days of repair were necessary, but the captain was unable to convince the Lady of this.  "I am unaccustomed to being told 'No', captain".  She gave him two days and refused to pay any more than she had for their passage.  His crew was unamused, and barely raised a hand when the Lady and Naomi decided to walk into Nightport alone looking for "decent lodgings."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227795/#Comment_227795" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T04:30:51+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  4:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>We also saw a flashback to Vance's days in the empire, when he attended a formal ball and first met a young Lady Blackbird.

It was such a cool move giving the characters a deep, one-sided backstory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
