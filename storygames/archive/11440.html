Notable for having an excellent first five minutes and an abysmal the rest of the game, everything everyone was calling Unique was already done with more style and competence years ago in the Last Express. Indigo Prophecy was guilty of some pretty terrible illusion of choice. Every presentation of a choice you make only provided the merest of aesthetic differences in the story (As opposed to the amazing power you exerted on the story in another older game, Deus Ex). Indigo Prophecy was littered with game overs that simply didn't make sense. Why did I get a game over because I didn't feel like playing Simon Says while the protagonist practiced his guitar in the background? It added nothing to the story, was never reincorporated, and was really just pointless filler. I'm surprised this never broke anyone else's illusion. Of course the only real choice you got to 'make' was right during the final boss fight against I believe it was a sentient AI from the future trying to steal Aztec Magic. If you lost right in the beginning, you got Ending A. If you lost about halfway through, you got Ending B. If you won, you got Ending C. That is the only choice that affected the supposedly open story of Indigo Prophecy. So enough on why his previous game was stupid.</p>\n<p>Did you watch the first nine minutes of Heavy Rain? I'll wait for you. Okay, so what did you see. Did you see all semblance of real interactivity stripped out for banal token interactions? Let's go over some of the obvious ones. Game stops if you stop doing what the game wants you to do, and tells you what you should be doing. <em>Brushing your teeth</em> and <em>getting out of bed</em> are interactive to some degree. Driving around an RC car, something that can be given direct control, is a cutscene you initiate by pressing X. Suppose you don't want to 'do some work' as the voice over tells you, maybe you want to go out the front door and check the mail. Too bad, you can't because trying to open the front door starts another cutscene of our hero opening and closing the door. That is not interactive story telling, that is watching a badly edited, badly acted movie while prompted to press buttons for irrelevant tasks.</p>\n<p>Here are Jordan Mechner's (of the original Prince of Persia and the Last Express fame) rules for story-based game design, from over 10 years ago. They are a little bit dated but altogether quite good for the purpose of video games.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ol>\n<li>The story is what the player does, not what he watches.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>2. List the actions the player actually performs in the game and take a cold hard look at it. Does it sound like fun? (Resist the temptation to embellish. If a cinematic shows the player\u2019s character sneak into a compound, clobber a guard and put on his uniform, the player\u2019s action is \u201cWatch cinematic.\u201d Letting the player click to clobber the guard isn\u2019t much better.)<br/>\n3. The only significant actions are those that affect the player\u2019s ability to perform future actions. Everything else is bells and whistles.<br/>\n4. Design a clear and simple interface. The primary task of the interface is to present the player with a choice of the available actions at each moment and to provide instant feedback when the player makes a choice.<br/>\n5. The player needs a goal at all times, even if it\u2019s a mistaken one. If there\u2019s nothing specific he wishes to accomplish, he will soon get bored, even if the game is rich with graphics and sound.<br/>\n6. The more the player feels that the events of the game are being caused by his own actions, the better \u2014 even when this is an illusion.<br/>\n7. Analyze the events of the story in terms of their effect on the player\u2019s goals. For each event, ask: Does this move the player closer to or further away from a goal, or give him a new goal? If not, it\u2019s irrelevant to the game.<br/>\n8. The longer the player plays without a break, the more his sense of the reality of the world is built up. Any time he dies or has to restart from a saved game, the spell is broken.<br/>\n9. Alternative paths, recoverable errors, multiple solutions to the same problem, missed opportunities that can be made up later, are all good.<br/>\n10. Don\u2019t introduce gratuitous obstacles just to create a puzzle.<br/>\n11. As the player moves through the game, he should have the feeling that he is passing up potentially interesting avenues of exploration. The ideal outcome is for him to win the game having done 95% of what there is to do, but feeling that there might be another 50% he missed.</p>\n<p>What rules does Indigo Prophecy break? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6(arguable, many people were fooled), 7, 8, 9, 10(let's practice guitar!), 11(also arguable)</p>\n<p>What rules does Heavy Rain break in the first nine minutes? 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10(Brush your teeth by waggling your controller! Interactivity!)</p>\n<p>So what's the hubbub. Do you think there's a secret ending where the protagonist moves from the bedroom to the bathroom and refuses to eat for a week straight? That might imply there is an actual choice in pressing X to piss or waving your controller to brush your teeth.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254672/#Comment_254672" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T02:34:35+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  2:34AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That game sure seems pretty lame by my stuck-in-the-'90s lights.

As soon as you waggle your controller to towel her off in the bathroom, you can leave the bathroom and be attacked by one, no two, no three, no four masked murderers in the apartment.

I'm just not convinced that they've learned from the mistakes they made in <i>Indigo Prophecy</i>, and the videos I just watched on YouTube (the intro and the "applying makeup and tearing your skirt" bathroom scene narrated by the game designer) suggest that they really, really haven't.<br/><br/>I also strongly disagree with the Ars Technica guy about how breaking all these mundane activities down into smaller steps make you feel like you're in a real place.  <i>Heavy Rain</i> is, to all appearances, a mediocre cutscene-laden adventure game.  Giving me something to do with my fingers during those cutscenes is not the same thing as giving me gameplay.  Gameplay in an adventure game happens inside my brain: if I am thinking about what I should do, solving a puzzle, deciding what to try next, that's where the meat is.  I'm not seeing that in these clips, I'm just seeing what can most charitably be described as "padding."  It's a cute idea to make all those mundane things interactive instead of just being static backgrounds that your on-screen character walks past, but what purpose is it really serving?<br/><br/>Maybe there's a really great, really flexible story there, like the hype claims.  Maybe it's a really mature, interesting, entertaining tale that can go in dozens of different directions, according to whatever choices you make during play.  (And if that's the case, then maybe they did learn something from their mistakes after all!)  But the QTE nonsense just plain doesn't look fun to do, and if it isn't fun to do it will inevitably drag that mature, interesting, entertaining tale down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254785/#Comment_254785" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T11:23:29+00:00" title="February  3, 2010 11:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get why this (and Indigo Prophesy) generate so much interest: In a field dominated by this simple breakdown: - "In this game, do you shoot laser guns, magical fireballs, or real guns at millions and millions of enemies?" - something that vows to (in the beginning anyway) keep things "realistic" and "grounded in the real world" (as much as an episode of Law and Order, anyway) while still using state-of-the-art graphics is simply fucking refreshing.<br/><br/>Even the guitar moments and "press buttons to not get anxiety while trapped in a small space" sequences, including game-overs, back up that "real world-ish" feel that the game is going for. It's only when aztec cult computer AI ninja zombies show up that the game tea-bags you. "Oh, you thought the mystery would end in a /normal real-world conspiracy?/ LOL - <b><i>We're French! </i></b>Now get your fingers ready for a Kung Fu Fight with Aztec Ninja Wizard using only quicktime button-mashing!"<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/FIPAction.jpg/800px-FIPAction.jpg"/><br/>i wish i was kidding<br/><br/>To some degree, that's why the Ryuu ga Gotoku/"Yakuza" franchise has been so popular in Japan. The first two were simply excellently written (as they were written by a famous crime novelist). Yakuza 3 isn't as strong of a story IMO, it kinda rests on the edge of "Oh C'mon, Reaaaallly?" at times (see: "Long Lost Twin Brother" of a friend), but still it's got hot graphics, voice acting and production and it's set in a modern world that might be a little darker and seedier, but still "realistic" to some degree. If you've got a PS3, I'd say give it a rent and see what you think when it comes out in English next month. Personally, my fave of the franchise is Yakuza 2 for the PS2, its story is pretty awesome.<br/><br/>I'll give Heavy Rain a shot. And by that I mean, I'll buy it when it comes down to $30, I'll play it through, then sell it on eBay for $25-28 to cover my loss.<br/><br/>To bring it back to the world of RPGs (not that it needs to to keep the thread here or anything; just cause I see parallels), I see the drive to want to use tabletop to do some "real world roleplaying" as part of the success that drove people to really enjoy PTA. Sure, PTA emulates reality through a TV screen, and sure there's nothing stopping you from playing Buffy The Vampire Slayer Joins Starfleet, but a lot of the games I played in were basically along the lines of The Wire: No magic, no lasers, no Hong Kong gunfights. All those are fun, but sometimes it's nice to take a fucking break and get back to real character drama.<br/><br/>Indigo Prophesy (Farenheit) led the promise of that, but them the Producer used his fanmail and social pushiness to fuck the game up.

But, of course, as you demonstrated in your post above, there doesn't seem to be much of story or consequences in Heavy Rain. So, a) whatever Ben Kuchera was going on about has nothing to do with <i>Heavy Rain</i>; and b) the thing I would love to play doesn't seem to be in <i>Heavy Rain</i>. Why Kuchera thinks the game is good I no longer have any idea. <br/><br/>In short, <i>Heavy Rain</i> seems to be built off the same crappy assumptions that many folks pulled about "story" from RPGs back in the 80s and 90s. There's this dude that manipulates the player through the "right" story.<br/><br/>Yesterday I was thinking, "Gamers who figured out what story is go on to be screenwriters. Gamers who get stuck in the trap of crappy manipulation go on to be game developers."<br/><br/>I know that there's going to be cool, actual story and consequences coming down the road in video games some day.

When the protagonist felt tense, I was DOING something that was tense.  It made the story very engaging.

I've <a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=59" rel="nofollow">laid one out</a> before.<br/><br/>Now to the main part.  I disagree with pretty much every single one of Mechner's points--and, really, Prince of Persia ("PoP") didn't fulfill most of them.  Like No. 8.  Do you know how many times I've died playing the original PoP?  Many, many times.  And I'm not a bad player.  (In fact, I have yet to fail at a single QT event in Indigo Prophecy.)  Also: alternate options or pathways?  Not in PoP that I remember.<br/><br/>There's an interesting parallel there between what you and Mechner are saying, and what Hardcore Macho Nar Play has been saying: all the conflicts, all the time, and only tough choices and hard consequences matter.  Again, I really disagree with that one.  (Note that disagreement here is a matter of taste: I mean, "I don't feel that way about the way I enjoy story in games.")  I get meaningful scenes in games all the time, even when my choices or actions don't impact the end result.  For example, the decision in IP to save--or not--the drowning kid while a policeman is near who might, in your attempt, spot and arrest you for murder.  The first time I played, I walked away.  That didn't matter for the outcome of the game.  But it was <i>meaningful </i>to me.  It meant something in the larger story.  It said something about my character, and it colored the narrative.  The second time I played, I rescued the boy.  That changed the tone of the story in a way that I could feel, even though it didn't change anything else.<br/><br/>Let me get philosophical for a moment here.  In a few million years, our sun is going to explode.  After that, whatever humanity ever did will be gone.  The state of the universe will be the same whether we existed on this planet or not, whether we made good or bad choices.  Nothing has permanent consequences in our universe.  So saying that what we as people do only has meaning due to lasting consequences doesn't make sense to me.  Instead, I find meaning in choices as they happen.  It matters now, in the moment.  It matters that I chose to shared my muffins with that homeless guy outside of Go Play NW's venue.  It matters that I broke up with my first girlfriend in a way she really didn't deserve.  Even as those choices have no permanently lasting consequences or affect how my life story ends.  Consider this a deontology-vs-teleology thing, if you want, but I think choices matter much more than consequences.<br/><br/>In <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>, there's a moment where a merchant is abusing his position to raise prices in a war zone, while people around him starve.  My character could either help him, force him to lower prices, or kill him and take his stuff.  That decision (aside from having a bit more stuff, potentially) doesn't make a difference to what ending of the game you get or what happens later in the game.  But boy, did I agonize over that one.  My character, a lady from a noble family and kind of a snob, sided with the merchant (law and order must remain even in war times).  It's not what I personally would have done.  That <i>mattered</i> to me.  It was part of <i>my</i> story.<br/><br/>So that's the thing about choices.  But it's not all about choices.  Story is about poignant moments as well, moments that touch us.  Here's what Ars Technica wrote about a scene in <i>Heavy Rain</i>:\n<blockquote>Heavy Rain deals with parenthood, and the tragedies that keep parents up at night. In one heartbreaking scene, you sit next to your son and hope he says something to you. A schedule for his visit is pasted on the wall. Look at this scene in a certain way, and nothing happens. From another perspective, this is one of the most mature moments in modern gaming.</blockquote>\nAs a parent, I think this and other scenes will resonate with me.  They will matter to me.  It may not be a "game" in that moment as a "movie scene", but the medium still draws you (or at least me) in more, and it's definitely part of the story.<br/><br/>This kind of stuff--character moments without conflicts or drastic change or consequences--is much underappreciated in roleplaying.  Games like <i>Ribbon Drive</i> thrive on them, however, as I've <a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=40" rel="nofollow">written about before</a>.  And I don't think Mechner's points speak to these at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254884/#Comment_254884" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T19:53:38+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  7:53PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 8:13PM by Tulpa.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This'll be a short response to what I can respond to immediately while I think about the rest of your post.

I was not really in the role of my character because the writing was so shoddy, so I felt no compulsion to save the drowning kid or otherwise. Despite laying low and being completely unrecognized by the police, I was still arrested later. And then the giant invisible cockroaches started chasing my character and that was the first time I turned the game off in disgust. Every act of actual narrative interest IP committed was quickly undone by something unbelievably childish and stupid. Practicing imaginary guitar by playing simon says did not have any emotional or narrative impetus for me. Why can't my character just be a bad guitarist? Why does he have to be this mary sue matrix superhero that can also 'rock out' on the 'guitar' in his improbably large New York Studio Apartment?</p>\n<p>Yes, this is a game which provided me with a choice of whether to save a random drowning kid. It shouted at me from the rooftops, look a choice that would change the story. It didn't change the story, and the choice rang hollow. Deus Ex provided me with the choice of whether to stay and save my brother or run away(This is a spoiler, most people that have played the game never know that this is even possible) but it doesn't shove this choice in your face, it doesn't invoke a quick time event and it is a much more powerful event when (If) you succeed. It DOES change the story, quite significantly AND it determines the kind of character I am playing in a way that a binary throw away choice "Would you save a kid if you had matrix superpowers and no risk of getting caught by the police, or wouldn't you?" utterly fails.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254890/#Comment_254890" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T20:10:58+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  8:10PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...

My progeny will have jumped ship and gone on to conquer the galaxy long, long, long before the sun goes out. Obviously your problem is that you're not taking a long enough view on game critique, which leads you to godless relativism.<br/><br/>As for choices in games, seems to me like you're simply talking of different kinds of choices. Choices as a tool of immersion is a different thing than choices as a tool of game-play: the former works on the theory that making a choice forces a player into an in-character perspective, enforcing immersion. The latter proposition is that games are interactive frameworks, and thus need players to have impactful choices that not only influence the end-state of the game, but allow the player to see the influence he is having. These two things are so different that I don't even try to critique all things called "games" against the same standards. If a "game" is actually an immersive "interactive movie" (a thoroughly debased term, that, as it devalues the idea of interactivity by definition) like many video games nowadays are, then calling it out for not having significant choices is foolish; the important thing is whether the choices the game proffers are successful in supporting an immersion, not whether they matter the way they would in a real game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254915/#Comment_254915" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T21:17:26+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  9:17PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 9:20PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jared.<br/>Thanks for the link.<br/>That was sweet, sweet.<br/>(Not in an "adorable" awwww kind of way.

Rather, this thing should be evaluated on its own merits, and if it's actually a great piece of art in this new genre of immersive game / interactive movie, then more glory to it as such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254947/#Comment_254947" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T01:01:56+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  1:01AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>They make a really, really big deal out of how you use the controls to do all of these little things, but the question of "Is it rewarding to do these things?" seems to be very carefully not mentioned.</blockquote>\nJust like  in the promo materials for every other game released in recent memory.

But it won't be a bad game just because it fails to cater to your personal preferences (although it may well do nothing for you for just that reason).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254955/#Comment_254955" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T02:26:28+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  2:26AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, dude, seriously:  I think I've thrown more than enough qualifiers into everything I've written in this thread to make it clear that I'm only judging <i>Heavy Rain</i> by its promotional materials, and I would hope that anyone who is paying even a little bit of attention would be able to tell how I feel about pre-release hype.<br/><br/>So before anyone else decides to pick up their sword and shield and defend <i>Heavy Rain</i>'s honor, let me say it again: I have not played this game, and therefore whatever insult (real or imagined) I can inflict upon it is totally inconsequential.  All I can say, all I've ever said, is that based on what they've shown of it, it does not seem to be a game whose basic mechanics would be fun.<br/><br/>They're pitching it as an adventure game, apparently, but the videos on display so far seem to have precious little of what I would call an adventure game; it looks more like an interactive movie, as Eero says.  And if that's what it actually is, then sure, let's not judge it by the same standards we'd judge an adventure game by; but again, I'm going to say that it should be a <i>good</i> interactive movie, as good as it can be, and I would particularly want its interactive component to be something that is entertaining and rewarding in some way, so that it doesn't feel like useless padding.  What they've shown of the interactive stuff so far hasn't looked all that entertaining (but has looked a lot like useless padding), and I freely admit to being irked by that.<br/><br/>So there it is: I admit to wanting the game to be good and fun and entertaining, and that I am not pleased when what I see so far doesn't convince me that it will be.  It doesn't even look that innovative, except in how far it dives into the quick-time event mechanic and how many background objects you can interact with.  Furthermore, I admit to wanting entertainment products to be good, to wanting to enjoy them, and I even confess to having particular feelings on the subject of what makes something good or not.  I know, I'm an awful person.  Call the internet police -- I'll go quietly, I promise!<br/><br/>Or, y'know, we can both just chill out, wait for it to be released, and see which one of us guessed right about how good it would be.  :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254976/#Comment_254976" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T06:26:03+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  6:26AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>So before anyone else decides to pick up their sword and shield and defend<i>Heavy Rain</i>'s honor</blockquote>\nThat's kind of what Tulpa asked for at the end of the OP <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But yeah, at this point we're probably stuck with "We'll have to see how it turns out."

I guess David Cage still has some kind of bandage fetish, although at least this time the guy isn't an ice-cold reanimated corpse, a la <i>Indigo Prophecy</i>.  (I hope not, anyway.)<br/><br/>The demo left me...a little nonplussed.  It's not terrible -- it seemed like an average-quality adventure-ish game with good atmosphere, and the controller mechanics are a bit obtrusive and not much fun (but still miles ahead of <i>Indigo Prophecy</i>'s Simon-Says quicktime events).  I'm going to have to wait for the word on the full game, I guess; the demo didn't blow it, but it didn't make the sale, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256375/#Comment_256375" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T14:53:37+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  2:53PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I do not currently own a playstation 3, can anyone tell me about how the demo breaks with the conventions of reality by including a character with magic sci fi detective glasses or something?

It's definitely a weird way to do it, and one I could have done without.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256456/#Comment_256456" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-13T00:01:58+00:00" title="February 13, 2010 12:01AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2010 12:05AM by Tulpa.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Ah so it's basically one of those awkward fashionable bullet point features?
