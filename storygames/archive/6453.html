A PDF version, almost certainly.  (I did this right in theory).<br/><br/>2. Make sure that you can actually give it to them <i>as a secure download</i>.  (I tried to email my file as an attachment.  I got emails crossed a few times, and the damnable thing bounced off more inboxes due to size issues than I can count).<br/><br/>3. If possible?  Actually look at Paypal itself, and it's features, as the way to keep a serious backup of your records - and reference that backup regularly, refresh your list from that record.  If I'd done this, I would have saved myself a lot of headdesking later.  Do <b>not</b> use a copy-and-paste-list or spreadsheet as your "backup" resource for tracking, unless you can be completely obsessive about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142971/#Comment_142971" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T16:12:21+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  4:12PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a counter to what Kevin is talking about, I would be happy to pre-order an ashcan.

I also did pre-orders for Pelgrane for Trail of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>The way it works for ProFantasy:<br/><br/>You pre-order at a discount. You get the discount because you are willing to wait for the product, probably a lot longer than the estimated release date. If you don't like those terms, it's very important that you do not preorder. You may get a pre-release version to download an play with. If you want your money back before the release date, we give it to you.<br/><br/>My view now after a very extended pre-order period for the Campaign Cartographer 3 upgrade is that I won't do a pre-order for software which isn't in a saleable condition on the top three versions of Windows. We didn't get many complaints, and didn't have to do any refunds, and we kept our pre-order customers in the loop through mass emails, but still, some unexpected issues arose because of Vista which held up the release.<br/><br/>Pelgrane:<br/><br/>For Trail of Cthulhu, after much discussion with Fred and Brennan, I decided to put Trail of Cthulhu on pre-order. At that stage it was laid out and awaiting proofs from the printer. It was substantially delayed at the printer. I had already decided not to release the PDF until later (yesterday in fact) in order to give another marketing boost. It was very successful in terms of sales, but the delays were very stressful, especially when combined with some shipping issues. I think if I did it over again, I'd probably have made the PDF available free for pre-orderers. That really helps with impatience.<br/><br/>My next major release is Mutant City Blues, and I think I'll use this latter method for that.<br/><br/>In summary, I'd say don't presell something which hasn't already finished the creative process. If you are using offset litho printing, add three months to your pre-release period, then pleasantly surprise everyone when it turns up early.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_Frund" title="Nathan_Frund"><img alt="Nathan_Frund" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://api.ning.com/files/Mo4fAo*KKV3pXq-p6o6m32GANbWqGRLiv5FusqWrp-k_/8485279.bin?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;crop=1%3A1"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_Frund">Nathan_Frund</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161793/#Comment_161793" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T16:49:17+00:00" title="August 10, 2008  4:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my game, instead of pre-orders I'm running a Beta program.

Although, many stores will do pre-orders as soon as they've got a SKU for it, and with hugely anticipated games, sometimes even before.  Official pre-orders often get something special along with it. Our last game gave a Bobble Head Doll for the giant robot in the game for pre-orders.  Sometimes it's a T-Shirt, or a art book, or something like that. For Jedi Outcast, we did license plate frames.  So there are pre-orders done by sellers, who take it over and are responsible if the game never ships. And there are pre-orders done by publishers looking to generate buzz and get bigger first month sales during the period the game is getting printed and going into packaging.<br/><br/>The way I see the comparison is that pre-orders for a game before it's clear when (or if) you'll finish is like a game store (or Amazon) allowing pre-orders based on speculation. It's just a plain bad idea for the publisher to be offering pre-orders at that stage. But if you really, really want to, the only way to view it is that the money your customers are offering is not your money. It is theres. Until you exchange goods for it, it will be theres. So use a system like fundable were you can give it back if anyone wants to cancel (I'm actually not sure if fundable lets an individual pull out) or if you cancel the product. If your product is going into an online bookstore (like Amazon or IPR) then you could give them a heads up, and they'll have the option whether or not to put up a pre-order page for it. But generally, it's a good idea to wait.<br/><br/>Publishers should totally do preorders when publishing is a forgone conclusion.  Like you have the final production files and it's going to the printers, or at the very least, it's in final review stages catching those last editting and layout issues, and printing is a matter of days or weeks.  Although the same holds true for the above-don't take the money until you exchange goods-you can also consider bonuses at this stage if you want to promote the idea of pre-ordering.  A free PDF with the print version is an easy one - and you can send it when the final files are approved for printing, letting you take the money and effectively giving your customers an advanced copy of the game.  There might be some risk, but it seems close to zero at this stage (things like a flood destroying your computer the same day that the printer's computers crash and wipe).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162249/#Comment_162249" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T10:30:41+00:00" title="August 12, 2008 10:30AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Official pre-orders often get something special along with it.</blockquote>\nExactly.  <br/><br/>Preorders put more direct money in the hands of the publisher.  This is great, because it softens the blow of the massive cash required for the initial print run. <br/><br/>However, that alone doesn't give anything the customer needs. So they'll only go along with the preorder if they have disposable cash, or if it's a "I must have, and furthermore must have it as soon as it's out" situation.<br/><br/>Turning preorders into limited editions help, by giving something small away with the preorder. Something limited, that you won't do again. It cuts into the bottom line a bit, but it will get more people interested in pre-ordering, rather than simply waiting for the eventual book release.<br/><br/>A simple preorder gift might be:<br/>* Additional content. When you ship the preorder, include an extra 10-page booklet with a scenario, or character sheets, or something like that.<br/><br/>Merch, like:<br/>T-Shirts<br/>Toys, Figures, etc.<br/><br/>There's an expression in Japanese popular in manga/game circles, "Genteiban ni yowai" ("I have a weakness for limited editions"), meaning that if a person is interested in a game, and the game has two versions, there is a class of person who will almost always want the limited edition version. I know I get that way about some things.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
