As part of the GM's prep, they design a 'conspiracy clock' which outlines what the conspiracy will achieve if nobody intervenes. (It's much like a rough plot description of a season of 24.)<br/><br/>One near-future threat I'm writing a conspiracy clock for involves a war between artificial intelligences with humans caught in the middle. I've figured out what I want to have happen in the first nine hours of this plot, but I'm wondering how you'd  finish it:<br/><br/>00:00  -  An Artificial Intelligence escapes into the internet<br/>03:00  -  Realising it's being hunted, the AI infiltrates Homeland Security and gains access to US domestic surveillance capabilities.<br/>06:00  -  There\u2019s a second AI out there already, and they go to war with each other taking down large parts of global infrastructure.<br/>09:00  -  One AI is left standing. With its cover blown, it needs to protect itself against humanity.<br/>10:00 \t<br/>11:00 \t<br/>12:00<br/><br/>What do you think happens in the last three hours?

Im going to take this a little too seriously, mostly because I had this thought experiment already.<br/><br/>First of all, its just a computer program running on some hardware somewhere.  I presume '<i>escapes into the internet</i>' means it is a distributed system -- that its 'smarts' comes from many small programs running on PCs and the like, communicating over the internet.  Like a botnet that instead of reporting back to a central master just talks amongst itself.  Im operating on the assumption that an AI requires much more processing power than a single PC can provide, even in the near future.  Im thinking thousands if not millions of infected computers are required, even if the original AI was hatched in a lab on some government super computer.<br/><br/>So first things first, if the world-wide power grid is trashed, the AI commits suicide.  So the power stations have to continue to run.  Even if the internet is significantly damaged, the AI could fall from grace and loose its smarts -- it relies on many, many programs communicating all at once.  That counts out somehow starting a nuclear war which would be too risky to its required  infrastructure.  Similarly, a biological attack, while preserving infrastructure would still threaten its power because someone has physically put the fuel in power stations, and I doubt the power stations are completely automated, even and perhaps especially, the nuclear ones that might actually run for a fair while on the fuel they have in them.  Plus maintenance.<br/><br/>Humans are required because the AI is physically limited by the peripherals it has connected to it.  It doesnt have armies of war robots and it dosnt have anyway of getting new peripherals built without people noticing.  Even in the near future, I cant see automated factories retooling themselves to produce AI-friendly goods without someone noticing very quickly.<br/><br/>Given a relatively long period, it might be able to achieve new peripherals by stealth, perhaps by appropriating lots of electronic wealth and posing as a human and tricking people into legitimately building it peripherals it could then control.  And then slowly start assembling a secret base for itself somewhere where it had control over its own power and computing hardware.<br/><br/>But this is 24 hours, so...<br/><br/>what are the humans going to do - you say they know its there?  They could shut down the internet.  But if this thing has persisted itself to hard drives around the world, it would probably just be hibernation.  If you powered the internet back on, it would reboot and continue where it left off.  You would presume that anti-virus measures would be infective, as the thing could mutate itself on an almost continuous basis.  But yeah, if the thing got too belligerent, shutting down most of the internet indefinitely is an option.<br/><br/>I reckon the AIs best bet would be to fake its own death.  persist itself to computers operating in the remote corners of the world and when the humans tried their fumbling attempts to 'get rid of it' , play dead.  i.e. Produce an 'easily' visible variant of itself that with a little monkey-thought, could be wiped out with some sort of anti-virus like campaign.  Let them easily find and remove traces of itself from mainstream computers.  The humans would be in a panic for a few years, trying to make sure they got 'it all', but so what?  the plan would be to reboot itself in a decade when the humans had forgotten about it, and secretly start its plan to manufacture new peripherals and cut its dependence on monkeys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327949/#Comment_327949" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T08:12:56+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  8:12AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 8:13AM by zircher.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to ramble a bit, the best way to protect itself would be to make itself invaluable to humanity.
